A small fraction of the\nelectrons and protons picked up by the jet are continuously accelerated to a\npower-law spectrum, estimated based on the local magnetic field strength,\nturbulence, and ambient density, for which we assume power-law profiles. The\nmodel parameters are thus directly tied to the jet physics and are comparable\nin number to typical single-zone models. We then numerically calculate the\nemission along the jet.

Two shocks arise: one into\nthe wind and another into the cloud. If adiabatic, electrons and protons are\nefficiently accelerated via Fermi processes to relativistic energies. In dense\nwinds, the resulting high-energy photons are absorbed and reprocessed within\nthe photosphere, while neutrinos from inelastic $pp$ collisions escape. We\nexplore the potential of super-accreting AGNs as neutrino sources and propose a\nnew class of emitter: an AGN without jets or gamma-ray counterparts, but with a\nstrong opaque disk wind. As a case study, we consider a SMBH with $M_{\\rm\nBH}=10^6,M_{\\odot}$ and accretion rates consistent with tidal disruption events\n(TDEs). We compute the main cooling processes for relativistic particles and\nshow that super-Eddington SMBHs can produce detectable neutrino fluxes with\nonly weak electromagnetic signatures. Such fluxes may be observable by\nIceCube-Gen2 in nearby galaxies with a high BLR cloud filling factor. For more\nmassive black holes, detection remains possible with moderate filling factors\nif the source is close, or at larger distances if the filling factor is high.\nOur model thus provides a plausible scenario for extragalactic neutrino\nsources, where both flux and timescale are determined by the number of orbiting\nclouds and the duration of the super-accreting phase."}

We\nself-consistently model the accretion disc for each interacting binary system\nin a grid of stellar evolution models and then combine these to obtain the\ntotal X-ray spectra for stellar populations over a range of ages and\nmetallicities. Crucially, these are estimated using the same stellar models as\nthose used for modelling the stellar spectral energy distribution. We utilise\nfirst principle equations to calculate the X-ray binary (XRB) evolution,\nluminosity and spectral energy densities of individual accreting compact\nobjects. Population synthesis using observationally motivated values for\nR_inner (the accretion disc inner truncation radius) reproduces the observed\nX-ray number evolution in the Small Magellanic Cloud and the inferred X-ray\nflux evolution for M51, validating our models. Using these models, we explore\nthe implications of a self-consistent stellar and XRB emission population\nsynthesis for ionizing photon production, the XRB dependence on metallicity\nand, for XRBs as a potential source of nebular He II emission seen in the\nspectra of high redshift galaxies.

In the\nhard state, we identified a new clocked bursting epoch, during which the burst\nrecurrence time remained highly stable and unprecedentedly short among the\nclocked bursting phases of GS~1826$-$238, with $t_{\\rm rec} = 1.603 \\pm\n0.040$~hr~($1\\sigma$ error).

They have been long\naccounted among the best targets to search for indirect DM signatures in the\nGeV-to-TeV gamma-rays due to absence of astrophysical gamma-ray foreground or\nbackground emission. We present forecasts on the sensitivity of the future CTAO\nfor the search for annihilating or decaying DM in such targets. We perform an\noriginal selection of candidates out of the current catalog of known objects,\nincluding both classical and ultra-faint targets. For each of them, we\ncalculate the expected amount of DM using the most updated and complete\navailable samples of photometric and spectroscopic data of member stars,\nadopting a common framework of data treatment for both classes of objects. In\nthis way, we are able to generate novel astrophysical factor profiles for\ngeneral indirect DM searches that we compare with the current literature. Out\nof a starting sample of 64 dSphs, we highlight the 8 most promising targets -\nDraI, CBe, UMaII, UMi and Wil1 in the Northern hemisphere; RetII, Scl and SgrII\nin the Southern hemisphere - for which different DM density models (either\ncored or cuspy) lead to similar expectations, at variance with what happens for\nother DM targets - thus resulting in more robust predictions. We find that CTAO\nwill provide the strongest limits above ~10 TeV, down to values of\nvelocity-averaged annihilation cross section of ~5$ \\times 10^{-25}$ cm$^3$\ns$^{-1}$ and up to decay lifetimes of ~10$^{26}$ s for combined limits on the\nbest targets. We argue that the largest source of inaccuracy is due to the\nstill imprecise determination of the DM content, especially for ultra-faint\ndSphs. We propose possible strategies of observation for CTAO, either optimized\non a deep focus on the best known candidates, or on the diversification of\ntargets."}

Our model employs Gaussian\nProcesses (GPs) with astrophysically motivated priors to represent the mass\ndistribution, assuming both component masses are independently drawn from a\ncommon mass function. This approach enables us to capture complex features in\nthe population without relying on rigid parametric forms. Motivated by\npredictions from binary stellar evolution, we focus on the presence of a mass\ngap in the range $40-120~ M_\\odot$, attributed to the pair-instability\nsupernova (PISN) and pulsational PISN (PPISN) processes. Using our GP-based\nmodel, we find for the first time, strong evidence for the onset of this mass\ngap, locating its lower edge at approximately $45-60 ~M_\\odot$. We observe a\nsuppression in the BBH merger rate when comparing the latest constraints\nagainst our GP model, by a factor of $10-60$ at $\\sim60~M_\\odot$, corresponding\nto the minimum of the mass gap. Additionally, we find evidence of a\nsubpopulation of mergers populating the mass gap around $70 ~M_\\odot$, which we\nargue is due to hierarchical mergers, as well as of a feature in the $40-50~\nM_\\odot$ range, albeit with low significance, which we attribute to the\npredicted PPISN build up. We discuss the astrophysical implications of this\nresult in light of GW231123, a recently reported BBH merger with a total mass\npotentially above the PISN gap, suggesting the need for revised models of\nmassive stellar evolution or alternative formation channels."}

A significant fraction of such mergers could\noccur in Active Galactic Nuclei disks (AGN), however connecting individual\nblack hole mergers to host galaxies is a challenging endeavor due to large\nlocalization uncertainties. We assess the feasibility of determining the\nfraction of hierarchically merging black hole binaries by computing the angular\ncross-correlation between gravitational wave localization posteriors and galaxy\ncatalog skymaps. We forecast when the clustering of gravitational wave sky\nlocalizations can be measured accurately enough to distinguish the AGN origin\nscenario from hierarchical mergers in galaxies that do not host AGN.

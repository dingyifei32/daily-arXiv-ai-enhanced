An additional complexity to this task comes from\nchoosing appropriate representations of the data which retain all the relevant\ncosmological information, while reducing the dimensionality of the original\ndataset.

We analyze how these\nobservations vary in $\\Lambda$CDM versus dynamic dark energy. We find that the\ngalaxy-galaxy lensing signal is reduced by up to 7% with respect to galaxy\nclustering and that cosmic shear is suppressed by 14%. These differences are\nprimarily caused by changes to cosmological distance measures which enter the\nlensing efficiency kernels. In contrast, we find that dynamic dark energy\nincreases the thermal Sunyaev Zeldovich signal by about 15%, but that this is\ninsufficient to substantially reduce the magnitude of baryonic effects. Thus,\nwe find that dynamic dark energy may help explain two out of these three\ncosmological anomalies. DESI's dynamic dark energy has an important impact on\ncosmic expansion at $z\\lesssim 0.5$, a regime where baryon acoustic\noscillations are limited by the small volume.

We confirm our earlier findings of\nfast-moving ejecta ($v \\geq 0.6\\,c$) in this parameter regime and demonstrate a\nclear spin dependence, with fast-ejecta masses reaching up to $\\qty{\\sim\ne-3}{\\Mass\\Sun}$ for $a_{\\mathrm{BH}} = 0.8$. Most notably, we identify for the\nfirst time the presence of spiral wave-driven ejecta in black hole-neutron star\nmergers -- a phenomenon previously reported only in binary neutron star\nsystems. The mass of this component grows significantly with spin, reaching\nlevels up to $\\qty{\\sim 7e-3}{\\Mass\\Sun}$. These results establish a new\nspin-enhanced mechanism for powering blue kilonova emission in black\nhole-neutron star mergers, significantly extending the range of systems\nexpected to produce observable electromagnetic counterparts."}

Their origin traces back to\nhadronic collisions between protons and nuclei in the cosmic rays with hydrogen\nand helium in the target gas. To accurately interpret the data, a precise\ndetermination of the underlying cross sections is therefore mandatory. We\npresent a new evaluation of the neutrino production cross section from $p+p$\ncollisions, building on our previous analysis of the production cross section\nfor $\\pi^\\pm$, $K^\\pm$, and minor baryonic and mesonic channels. Cross sections\nfor scatterings involving nuclei heavier than protons are also derived. The\nnovelty of our approach is the analytical description of the Lorentz invariant\ncross section $\\sigma_{\\rm inv}$, and the fit of the model to the available\naccelerator data. We work with neutrino energies from $10$ GeV to $10^7$ GeV,\nand, correspondingly, to incident proton (nuclei) energies from $10$ GeV to\n$10^9$ GeV (GeV/n). We obtain the total differential cross section,\n$d\\sigma(p+p\\rightarrow \\nu+X)/dE_{\\nu}$ as a function of neutrino and proton\nenergies, with an estimated uncertainty of 5% for neutrino energies below 100\nGeV, increasing to 10% above TeV energies.

One of the main findings is that when $\\dot M_{\\rm\ninject}$ evolves to a value around the Eddington accretion rate, the radiation\npressure instability occurs. We test the influence of the model parameters on\nthe light curves, such as the BH mass $M_{\\rm BH}$, viscosity parameter\n$\\alpha$, and mass-injecting radius $R_{\\rm{out}}$, all of which are found to\naffect the light curves to some extent. In most cases, we find that the light\ncurves oscillate significantly due to the radiation pressure instability. As an\nexception, when $\\alpha$ is small or $R_{\\rm{out}}$ is large, we find that the\noscillations are completely suppressed. In this case, the light curve drops\nsteeply and then becomes flat in the late-time evolution, which is applied to\nexplaining the observed ultraviolet (UV) light curves of ASASSN-15oi and\nASASSN-14ae together with the assumption of a photosphere.

These reverberation features have both previously been detected for a few\nsupermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs).

The accompanying\ndetection of an iron line feature confirms the scenario of X-ray reverberation\nand provides strong evidence that the accretion flows in AGNs and X-ray\nbinaries are governed by an ubiquitous process.

Much of this uncertainty is\ndominated by the inability to resolve the width and separation in frequency of\nsharp atomic transition lines, leading to the common use of approximate\nfrequency-averaged treatments for the lines. In a previous paper, we calculated\nshock-cooling emission following explosions in core-collapse supernovae using a\nmult-group radiative transfer code, and compared the results to those of the\nsimilar and often used STELLA code from the literature. We found important\ndifferences in the spectral energy distribution (SED) resulting from different\nchoices of line opacity treatment. In our code, we used in the emissivity a\nfrequency-binned average of a high-resolution opacity, while in STELLA the\noften-used Eastman Pinto 1993 (EP93) prescription was employed. In this short\nletter we revisit this comparison, essentially reproducing STELLA bound-free\n(photoionization) and bound-bound (line transition) opacities. We show the\nimportance of introducing micro-plasma electron excitation level cutoffs in the\nequation of state (EOS). We also argue that EP93 is useful for estimating\nphoton mean free-path in the presence of a forest of lines, but that it can\nunderestimate photon production and reprocessing rates (emissivity) by orders\nof magnitude. To our knowledge, no fully-consistent coarse-frequency solution\ncurrently exists for line modeling in these systems. Finally, we describe new\nfeatures in our updated publicly available high-resolution frequency-dependent\nopacity table."}

The\nX-ray emitting region is far too small to be directly imaged, but rapid\nvariability of the X-ray signal can be used to infer the geometry by measuring\ntime lags caused by material propagating towards the black hole and by coronal\nX-rays reflecting off the disk to imprint a reverberation lag. Reverberation\nlags can be recognized by characteristic spectral features, including an iron\nemission line at $\\sim 6.4$ keV and a broad Compton hump peaking at $\\sim 30$\nkeV. These reverberation features have both previously been detected for a few\nsupermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, it is much\nmore challenging to detect reverberation lags from stellar-mass black holes\nbecause they are more than a million times smaller. Previous reverberation lag\nmeasurements for stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems have thus\nbeen limited to energies below 10 keV. Here we report on the first detection of\nthe Compton hump reverberation feature from an X-ray binary, achieved by\nmeasuring lags in the broad energy range of $\\sim 1-150$ keV. The accompanying\ndetection of an iron line feature confirms the scenario of X-ray reverberation\nand provides strong evidence that the accretion flows in AGNs and X-ray\nbinaries are governed by an ubiquitous process. Reverberation lags are\nprominent only in the most rapid variability, whereas lags in the slower\nvariability are commonly attributed to propagating mass accretion rate\nperturbations. Our lag measurements up to the highest energy to date reveal\nthat this lag in the slower variability evolves dramatically on timescales of\ndays."}

More recently, another Seyfert-starburst\ncomposite galaxy, NGC 7469, has shown hints for neutrino emission at even\nhigher energies. Theoretical investigations could clarify that their so-called\nAGN corona is the most-likely origin of these neutrinos due to the need of\nbeing partially $\\gamma$-ray opaque. In this work, we present an updated\nversion of our Seyfert-starburst composite model from 2022, that accounts for a\nproper treatment of the stochastic acceleration processes in the AGN corona and\nthe secondary electrons and positrons from leptonic radiation processes.\nMoreover, we use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to study the\nparameter space of these two potential high-energy neutrino sources under\nconsideration of the given prior knowledge. In the case of NGC 1068, we can\nsuccessfully explain its non-thermal observational features, where both its AGN\ncorona and starburst ring are needed to account for the observations at high-\nenergies. In the case of NGC 7469, the high-energy signatures can only be\nexplained assuming a small coronal radius and the including external\n$\\gamma\\gamma$-pair attenuation. In general, both sources exhibit a strong\ninfluence of the $\\gamma$-ray opaqueness on the results, highlighting the need\nfor an accurate treatment of the intrinsic coronal X-ray field and the spatial\nextent of the $\\gamma$-ray production site."}

In the last decade, there has been significant progress in our\nunderstanding of the cosmic history of extragalactic emissions associated with\nstellar evolution and accretion onto supermassive black holes, largely enabled\nby the extensive body of multi-wavelength data. The brightness of the\nextragalactic sky is now measured in photons, neutrinos, and cosmic rays, using\nobservatories on the ground, in the sea, and in the ice, satellites in Earth\norbit, and probes at the edge of the solar system. This wealth of disparate\ndata is essential to unraveling the mysteries of the source populations that\ncontribute to the extragalactic background.\n  In this contribution, we present an open database containing the most\ncomprehensive collection of measurements of the extragalactic background\nspectrum to date. The combination of multi-messenger measurements over 27\nfrequency decades allows us to estimate the energy density of most\nextragalactic background components with an uncertainty of less than 30%. We\nexplore the consistency of this cosmic inventory of the observed fields of\nrelativistic particles populating the Universe with the cosmic history of star\nformation and accretion around supermassive black holes. Models incorporating\nthese cosmic histories, as well as the redshift-dependent luminosity functions\nof extragalactic sources, currently match the electromagnetic component of the\nextragalactic background spectrum over 14 frequency decades, from the near UV\nto sub-TeV gamma rays. The knowledge gained from synthetic population models in\nthe electromagnetic bands may become a crucial tool for understanding the\norigin of the most energetic extragalactic messengers, neutrinos and\nultrahigh-energy cosmic rays."}

In this paper, we examine the fractional power scalar\npotential within the framework of Einstein Gauss Bonnet (EGB) gravity,\nincorporating standard slow roll approximation. The EGB theory, motivated by\nhigher dimensional models, introduces quadratic curvature corrections and a\ncoupling between the scalar field and the Gauss Bonnet term, thereby modifying\nthe cosmological dynamics. The results show good agreement with observational\ndata, placing the predictions within the $1 \\sigma$ region of the ACT $r-n_s$\nconstraint plot. Furthermore, incorporating the running of the scalar spectral\nindex reinforces the models consistency with observational bounds. We also\nexplore the parameter space of the EGB couplings and identify the range of free\nparameters for which the results of $n_s$ and $r$ values remain within the $1\n\\sigma$ region of the ACT constraints.

This effect can be described\nby joining shear bias and redshift characterisation in the effective redshift\ndistribution, $n_{\\gamma}(z)$, which includes the response of apparent shapes\nof detected objects to shear of galaxies at redshift $z$. In this work, we\npropose a novel method to correct $n_{\\gamma}(z)$ for redshift-mixed blending\nby emulating the shear response to neighbouring galaxies. Specifically, we\ndesign a ``half-sky-shearing'' simulation with HSC-Wide-like specifications, in\nwhich we extract the response of a detected object's measured ellipticity to\nshear of neighbouring galaxies among numerous galaxy pairs. We demonstrate the\nfeasibility of accurately emulating these pairwise responses and validate the\nrobustness of our approach under varying observing conditions and galaxy\npopulation uncertainties. We find that the effective redshift of sources at the\nhigh-redshift tail of the distribution is about 0.05 lower than expected when\nnot modelling the effect.

Among these, the $\\sim$140 ks\nobservation from 2014 was analyzed in detail for this study. This data provides\nthe best statistics and was taken when the jets were nearly perpendicular to\nthe line of sight and the accretion disk was eclipsed. By applying an\nenergy-dependent subpixel event repositioning algorithm and the Richardson-Lucy\ndeconvolution, we enhanced the spatial resolution and revealed eastern and\nwestern knot-like structures at a distance of $\\sim$1.7 arcsec ($\\sim 10^{17}$\ncm) from the core. These features are consistent with the kinematic precession\nmodel, and the positions of the knots suggest that they were ejected\napproximately 200 days prior to the observation. A comparison with VLA radio\ndata obtained at a similar precessional phase shows that the X-ray emission\nextends east-west on a scale comparable to that of the radio emission. While\nthe core is bright in both X-rays and radio, the brightness contrast between\nthe knots and the core is smaller in X-rays than in radio. Spatially resolved\nspectroscopy indicates that prominent Fe lines in the core X-ray spectrum are\nwell explained by thermal plasma emission. In contrast, Fe lines are not\nevident in the outer regions after accounting for potential core contamination,\nsuggesting a dominant contribution from non-thermal processes. These findings\nimply that the arcsecond-scale X-ray structures may vary observationally with\nviewing conditions or precessional phase, but likely reflect a relatively\nstable jet-driving mechanism operating within the SS 433 system."}

Thus, cosmic-ray transport\nis dominated by areas of low diffusion even if these areas occupy a relatively\nsmall, but not infinitesimal, fraction of the volume.

Our analysis focuses on neon-rich white\ndwarfs (Ne WDs), which are typical progenitor cores for ECSNe. We assume\nconservation of both baryon number ($N_B$) and dark matter particle number\n($N_D$) during collapse, allowing for a consistent mapping between progenitor\nand remnant configurations. We find that ADM significantly enhances the central\ndensity of the WD progenitor. This lowers the threshold gravitational mass\n$M^*$ required to initiate electron capture, enabling ECSNe from lower-mass\nprogenitors. The resulting remnants are stable, dark matter-admixed neutron\nstars with gravitational masses potentially well below current observational\nbounds.

A cross-listing to astro-ph.CO\n  is kindly requested due to the relevance to cosmological parameter\n  constraints", "summary": "The dispersion measure-redshift relation of fast radio bursts (FRBs) provides\na valuable cosmological probe for constraining the Hubble constant, offering an\nindependent measurement that could help resolve the ongoing Hubble tension. In\nthis paper, we begin with a sample of 117 localized FRBs and use 95 of them to\nconstrain $H_0$ to $71.28^{+1.90}_{-2.08}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ within the\nstandard Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\\Lambda$CDM) model. The resulting\nstatistical uncertainty is below 2.8\\%, improving previous FRB-based\nmeasurements and highlighting the promise of larger future samples. Beyond\nstatistical improvements, we note that different parameter choices have been\nadopted in previous studies and some results show discrepancies in $H_0$. To\naddress this issue, we perform a systematic assessment of modeling\nuncertainties that can affect the inferred value of $H_0$, including Galactic\nelectron density models, the contribution of the Galactic halo, outliers such\nas FRB~20190520B located in extreme environments, and the other parameter\nselections. We also discuss possible approaches to mitigate these sources of\nuncertainty, emphasizing both the challenges and prospects of using FRBs as\nreliable cosmological tools."}

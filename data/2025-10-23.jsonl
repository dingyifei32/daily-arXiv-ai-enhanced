Submitted to CQG", "summary": "Relativistic macroscopic plasma dynamics can be described by\ngeneral-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. In many high-energy astrophysical\nsettings, such as the interior dynamics of magnetized stars, the ideal GRMHD\napproximation, in which we assume infinite conductivity, provides an excellent\ndescription. However, ideal GRMHD neglects resistive effects that are essential\nfor processes such as magnetic reconnection, dissipation, and magnetospheric\ndynamics. Incorporating resistivity into astrophysical plasma models accounts\nfor the fact that plasmas in such environments are not perfect conductors. We\npresent a resistive version of the GPU-accelerated GRMHD code GRaM-X, which\nevolves the full resistive GRMHD equations using the Z4c formalism for\nEinstein's equations. We implement a second-order implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta\nscheme to handle stiff source terms, obtain the primitive quantities from the\nconserved quantities using a one-dimensional recovery method, and employ the\nHLLE Riemann solver in combination with TVD and WENO reconstruction schemes. We\nvalidate the module using a range of standard tests, including 1D shocktubes,\ncurrent sheets, Alfv\\'{e}n waves, 2D cylindrical explosions, and 3D TOV stars.\nThe results of these tests demonstrate accurate recovery of the ideal MHD\nlimit, correct resistive behavior, and stable evolution in dynamical\nspacetimes. Leveraging the GPU-accelerated resistive version of GRaM-X enables\nefficient large-scale simulations, paving the way for realistic studies of\nbinary mergers, accretion flows, and relativistic jets within the framework of\nmulti-messenger astrophysics."}

Using simulations the study tracks how sudden\naccretion boosts affect a critical spin-down phase (the superradiance drop)\nduring which the black hole's spin rapidly decreases while its mass remains\nnearly constant. The black hole spin evolution is controlled by the competition\nbetween two processes: how fast angular momentum is added through accretion,\nand how fast it is removed by the axion cloud. One major conclusion is that\nboosts to the accretion rate before the superradiance drop have the strongest\neffect, as they can delay or reshape the drop and significantly shrink the\nregion of the mass-spin plane depopulated due to the superradiance. In\nparticular, a super-Eddington accretion rate of 5 times Eddington accretion,\nlasting for 4 Myr and occurring 30 Myr before the superradiance drop can reduce\nthe superradiance exclusion region in the mass-spin plane by 40 percent. In\ncontrast, boosts to the accretion rate after the superradiance drop only cause\ntemporary changes in the black hole spin. The study also shows that black holes\nwith lighter axion clouds are more sensitive to these early boosts and can show\nobservable spin changes lasting tens to hundreds of millions of years. Heavier\naxion clouds, however, require much stronger or longer-lasting boosts to\nproduce similar effects, making them more stable under variable accretion."}

The former is thought to form a\ngeometrically thin disc while the diffuse wind could form a geometrically thick\nhot accretion flow. In this paper, we instead consider a more generalised case,\ni.e., accretion with both cold and hot gas supplies, which feed a disc and a\ncorona respectively. We investigate the interaction of disc and corona by\nanalysing the energy coupling and matter exchange, i.e. corona\ncondensation/disc evaporation, with a semi-analytical method. It is found that\nthe accretion geometry in the radial direction and the resultant emission\nspectrum depend strongly on both the total gas supply rate and the ratio of\ncold and hot gases. For gas supply rates of a few percent of the Eddington\nvalue, diverse geometries and spectral shapes are possible, depending on the\nfraction of cold gas supply. This provides an interpretation for the various\nspectra observed in intermediate states. However, at higher accretion rates,\nregardless of the form of the feeding gas, the inner accretion flow is always\ndisc-dominated, implying an inevitable transition to the soft state, while at\nvery low gas supply rates, hard state spectrum dominated by the hot flow is\nexpected.

Since an\n$X_{\\rm max}$ dependence leads to a primary composition dependence, this\nimplies that information on the mass composition is encoded not only in the LDF\nshape but also in its amplitude. This $X_{\\rm max}$ dependence can be explained\nin terms of two competing scalings of the measured electric field: One goes\nwith $(1/\\rho)^J$, where $\\rho$ is the air density at $X_{\\rm max}$ and $J$ is\na zenith dependent non-linearity factor describing coherence loss. This density\nscaling tends to decrease the geomagnetic emission of deeper showers. The other\nscaling goes with $(1/R)$, where $R$ is the distance from $X_{\\rm max}$ to the\ncore at ground, and instead increases the measured electric field of deeper\nshowers. At low zenith angles, the $(1/R)$ scaling is stronger and leads to\nlarger measured electric fields as $X_{\\rm max}$ increases. The picture at\nhigher zeniths, i.e., lower densities, is more nuanced. In this region, the\ndeflections due to the Lorentz force are much larger and introduce extra time\ndelays between the particle tracks, decreasing the coherence of the emission.\nThis loss of coherence is highly dependent on the strength of the geomagnetic\nfield and can slow down, or even reverse the increase of the radio emission\nwith decreasing air density. This strong, yet historically overlooked LDF\namplitude dependence on $X_{\\rm max}$/composition could be used to directly\ninfer, even bypassing any $X_{\\rm max}$ reconstruction, the cosmic ray primary\ncomposition on an event-by-event basis.

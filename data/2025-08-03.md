TL;DR: 论文研究了年轻中子星X射线双星Cir X-1及其周围的射电喷流气泡，通过射电成像和数值模拟揭示了喷流与超新星遗迹的相互作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Cir X-1的射电喷流气泡及其与超新星遗迹的关系，以理解中子星喷流在早期阶段的突破现象。

Method: 利用射电成像测量喷流气泡的最小能量，通过谱指数映射和PLUTO代码进行数值模拟，定性重现观测结果。

Result: 发现喷流气泡的最小能量约为10^45 erg，谱指数显示大部分区域为薄同步辐射，模拟表明不对称气泡可能是超新星爆发后强力喷流的结果。

Conclusion: Cir X-1可能是类似SS433的年轻喷流源，首次观测到中子星喷流从超新星遗迹中突破的现象。

Abstract: The young neutron star X-ray binary, Cir X-1, resides within its natal
supernova remnant and experiences ongoing outbursts every 16.5 days, likely due
to periastron passage in an eccentric orbit. We present the deepest ever radio
image of the field, which reveals relativistic jet-punched bubbles that are
aligned with the mean axis of the smaller-scale jets observed close to the
X-ray binary core. We are able to measure the minimum energy for the bubble,
which is around $E_{min}$ = $10^{45} $ erg. The nature and morphological
structure of the source were investigated through spectral index mapping and
numerical simulations. The spectral index map reveals a large fraction of the
nebula's radio continuum has a steep slope, associated with optically thin
synchrotron emission, although there are distinct regions with flatter spectra.
Our data are not sensitive enough to measure the spectral index of the
protruding bubbles. We used the PLUTO code to run relativistic hydrodynamic
simulations to try and qualitatively reproduce the observations with a combined
supernova-plus-jet system. We are able to do so using a simplified model in
which the asymmetrical bubbles are best represented by supernova explosion
which is closely followed (within 100 years) by a phase of very powerful jets
lasting less than 1000 years. These are the first observations revealing the
initial breakout of neutron star jets from their natal supernova remnant, and
further support the scenario in which Cir X-1 is a younger relation of the
archetypal jet source SS433.

Motivation: 尽管IceCube已探测到来自银河系的弥散中微子流，但具体来源仍不明确。通过分析具有π介子特征的天体源，可能揭示宇宙射线加速的场所。

Method: 使用13年的IceCube数据，对56个表现出π介子特征（200 MeV能谱断裂）的天体源进行中微子发射分析。

Result: 研究可能发现这些源的中微子发射，为宇宙射线加速提供证据。

Conclusion: 此分析有望增进对银河系内宇宙射线加速源的理解。

Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, located at the South Pole, covers a cubic
kilometer of Antarctic ice, and is designed to detect astrophysical neutrinos
in the TeV-PeV energy range. While IceCube has recently identified a diffuse
flux of neutrinos originating from the Galactic Plane, specific sources of
astrophysical neutrinos within the Milky Way remain elusive. Hadronic
gamma-rays, produced through the decay of neutral pions, are expected to
display a characteristic "pion bump" or "spectral break" around 200 MeV. Recent
studies by the Fermi-LAT Collaboration highlight 56 sources from the 4FGL
Catalog exhibiting a spectral break in the MeV energy range. Detecting
astrophysical neutrinos from these sources would provide compelling evidence
for cosmic-ray acceleration in their vicinity. In this analysis, we search for
astrophysical neutrino emission from 56 sources showing characteristics of a
pion bump using 13 years of IceCube data. Our findings could enhance our
understanding of potential cosmic-ray acceleration sites in the galaxy.

Motivation: 快速射电暴（FRB）的起源尚不明确，研究其能量和红移分布有助于揭示其物理机制和来源。

Method: 使用CHIME/FRB目录数据，分析FRB的能量分布（Schechter函数和断幂律函数）和红移分布（恒星形成历史模型及其他演化模型）。

Result: FRB能量分布符合Schechter函数，红移分布与恒星形成历史一致，表明FRB可能来源于年轻恒星群体。

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are brief, high-energy bursts of radio waves from
extragalactic sources, and their origin remains an open question. In this
paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the FRB population using the
first CHIME/FRB catalog, focusing on their energy and redshift distribution,
with careful consideration of selection effects. We investigate a range of
models, including the Schechter function and the broken power-law function for
the energy distribution, and several redshift evolution models, such as the
star formation history (SFH) model, as well as models incorporating time delays
relative to the SFH or additional redshift evolution factors. Our results
indicate that the energy distribution of FRBs is best described by the
Schechter function, with a power-law index of $\gamma = -1.49^{+0.37}_{-0.27}$
and a characteristic cutoff energy of $E_\mathrm{c} = 2.82^{+2.43}_{-1.47}
\times 10^{41}$ erg. Furthermore, we find no evidence for redshift evolution in
the energy distribution of FRBs. In terms of their redshift distribution, our
analysis shows that it follows the cosmic SFH, without requiring additional
delayed components or redshift evolution factors, suggesting that most FRBs
likely originate from young stellar populations. Simultaneously, we infer a
local volumetric rate of $\Phi_0 = 4.68^{+4.66}_{-2.39} \times 10^{4} \rm \
Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ for $E>10^{39}$ erg. These results, robust against CHIME
observational biases, may provide new insights into the underlying properties
of the FRB population.

### [5] [XL-Calibur Polarimetry of Cyg X-1 Further Constrains the Origin of its Hard-state X-ray Emission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23126)

TL;DR: XL-Calibur任务观测了黑洞X射线双星Cyg X-1，提供了迄今最精确的硬X射线偏振度和偏振角测量结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究黑洞X射线双星的硬X射线偏振特性，以理解其发射机制。

Method: 通过气球搭载的XL-Calibur仪器在2024年7月进行了近六天的观测。

Result: 测得硬X射线偏振度为(5.0^{+2.7}_{-3.0})%，偏振角为-28°±17°，与IXPE在2-8 keV的结果一致。

Conclusion: XL-Calibur的结果为宽带X射线和γ射线发射模型提供了独立约束。

Abstract: The balloon-borne hard X-ray polarimetry mission XL-Calibur observed the
Black Hole X-ray Binary (BHXRB) Cygnus X-1 (Cyg X-1) during its nearly six-day
Long Duration Balloon (LDB) flight from Sweden to Canada in July 2024. The
XL-Calibur observations allowed us to derive the most precise constraints to
date of the Polarization Degree (PD) and Polarization Angle (PA) of the hard
X-ray emission from a BHXRB. XL-Calibur observed Cyg X-1 in the hard state and
measured a $\sim$19-64 keV PD of ($5.0^{+2.7}_{-3.0}$)% at a PA of
$-28^{\circ}\pm 17^{\circ}$, with an 8.7% chance probability of detecting
larger PDs than the one observed, given an unpolarized signal. The XL-Calibur
results are thus comparable to the 2-8 keV PD and PA found by IXPE, with a
similar agreement between the hard X-ray PA and the radio jet direction. We
also discuss the implications of our polarization measurements in the context
of models describing the origin of the broadband X-ray and $\gamma$-ray
emission, to which XL-Calibur provides independent constraints on any proposed
emission modeling.

Conclusion: 该框架为解释无线电发射TDEs提供了新方法，并可独立补充传统质量估计，对研究SMBH有重要意义。10-100 GHz监测可在数月内获得SMBH质量。

Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) involving supermassive black holes (SMBHs)
often exhibit radio emission, yet its physical origin remains uncertain,
especially in non-jetted cases. In this Letter, we formulate a general
dynamical framework for a radio-emitting shell driven by disk winds and
expanding through a power-law ambient medium under the influence of SMBH
gravity. We derive and classify power-law-in-time solutions to the governing
equations in the adiabatic regime. In particular, a universal $t^{2/3}$ scaling
emerges naturally when gravitational energy dominates or is comparable to
thermal energy, irrespective of the ambient density profile, whereas the
classical Sedov-Taylor solution is recovered when gravity is negligible. Our
analysis reveals that, in regimes where SMBH gravity governs the shell
expansion, the SMBH mass can be inferred from radio observations of the shell.
This approach is independent of and complementary to conventional mass
estimators, with direct implications for interpreting radio-emitting TDEs and
probing SMBH demographics. Our formalism further predicts that 10-100 GHz
monitoring with existing and planned facilities can yield SMBH masses within
months of disruption, providing a time-domain analogue to reverberation
mapping.

Abstract: Theoretical models have long predicted the existence of shocks in
multi-transonic accretion flows onto a black hole, yet their fate under
realistic general relativistic simulations has not been fully tested. In this
study, we present results from high-resolution two-dimensional general
relativistic hydrodynamic (GRHD) and general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
(GRMHD) simulations of low-angular-momentum accretion flows onto Kerr black
holes, focusing on the formation of shocks in transonic accretion flow. We
demonstrate that for specific combinations of energy and angular momentum,
global shock solutions naturally emerge between multiple sonic points. These
shocks are sustained in both corotating and counter-rotating cases, and their
locations depend on specific energy, angular momentum, and the spin of the
black hole which is in good agreement with analytical solutions. In magnetized
flows, weak magnetic fields preserve the shock structure, whereas strong fields
suppress it, enhancing turbulence and driving powerful, magnetically dominated
jets/outflows. The strength and structure of the outflow also depend on a black
hole spin and magnetization, with higher black hole spin parameters leading to
faster jets. Shock solutions are found only in super-Alfv\'{e}nic regions,
where kinetic forces dominate. Our findings provide important insights into the
physics of hot corona formation and jet launching in low-angular-momentum
accretion systems such as Sgr~A$^*$ (weak jet/outflow) and X-ray binaries.

Conclusion: 蟹状星云脉冲星是研究天体物理等离子体透镜现象的长期理想目标。

Abstract: The Crab Pulsar is known to feature plasma lensing events known as echoes.
These events show additional components in the pulse profile which are produced
by signal that is deflected by ionized nebular material and are therefore
delayed relative to the primary emission. We observed the Crab pulsar with
\ac{CHIME} during its daily transits, creating an archive of baseband
recordings of bright single pulses (known as giant pulses) in the
400$-800\,\unit{MHz}$ band. From these, we produced daily stacks of aligned
pulses between late October 2021 and March 2024. We find that in these
averages, echoes are readily visible throughout the observation period, and we
identify clear groups of echoes with distinct behaviour in terms of their
evolution with time and frequency. Many echoes exhibit dispersive delays
consistent with being observed through excess column densities relative to the
unscattered rays, but we also find two events where the dispersive delays
indicate column density deficits. For the first time, we also find echoes for
which the line of sight never directly intersects the intervening structures,
resulting in events with non-zero minimum delays, of around ${0.5 \rm\,ms}$.
The frequency and diversity of the observed echoes make the Crab an excellent
target for long-term studies of astrophysical plasma lensing.

Method: 将丝状结构建模为带有薄电离层的圆柱形密集中性物质，模拟辐射偏转路径并预测回声特性。

Result: 模型成功预测了回声的延迟和不对称性，但未能定量匹配放大倍数，推测丝状结构可能更复杂。

Conclusion: 研究支持蟹状星云中存在小尺度丝状结构的假设，这些结构可能是光学图像中更大丝状体的子结构。

Abstract: Pulses from the Crab pulsar are often followed by ``echoes'', produced by
radiation that was deflected by small filamentary structures in the Crab nebula
and thus traveled via longer paths. We describe a simplified but detailed model
that treats the filaments as cylinders of dense, neutral material with a thin
ionized skin. In this picture, echoes are produced when the line of sight
crosses the skin at glancing incidence, which naturally leads to the large
electron column density gradients required to get the observed delays even with
electron densities comparable to those inferred from optical line emission
ratios. We compare the properties of the predicted echoes with those of a
relatively isolated observed one identified during daily monitoring with CHIME.
We find that the delays of the simulated echoes follow closely the near
quadratic evolution known to be a feature of these echoes, and that, unlike in
previous models, we match the characteristic observed asymmetry between
incoming and outgoing arcs, with the size of the gap in between a consequence
of the skin crossing time. However, our model fails to quantitatively reproduce
the magnifications of the echoes. We believe this likely is because the
filaments are not as smooth as envisaged, so that a given echo results from
many images. Nevertheless, our results strongly support the hypothesis that the
nebula is filled with small-scale filamentary structures, which may well be
substructures of the larger filaments that are seen in optical images.

Conclusion: 混合喷流模型为相对论性喷流的结构和观测特征提供了新的理论解释。

Abstract: Improved observational precision in relativistic jets has underscored the
need for tractable theoretical models. In this study, we construct a
semi-analytical hybrid jet model that incorporates both black hole-driven and
disk-driven components within the framework of steady, axisymmetric, ideal MHD.
We derive a condition that determines the launching sites of cold outflows,
introducing a new constraint on the magnetic field configuration threading the
accretion disk. Using the Bernoulli equation and critical point analysis, we
derive flow solutions along various magnetic field lines. Our hybrid jet model
shows that discontinuities in field-line angular velocity lead to clear
velocity shear and density jumps at the interface between the two jet
components. These features are accompanied by localized enhancements in
velocity and density, potentially explaining the observed limb-brightening.

Abstract: We present an analysis of new multi-wavelength observations of the TeV
gamma-ray binary HESS J0632+057, conducted using SALT, Swift, NuSTAR, and
VERITAS in 2023--2024. By combining these new data with archival observations,
we confirm previous suggestions of orbital variability in the source's X-ray
spectrum, including increased X-ray absorption at the orbital phase interval of
$\phi\approx0.3\textrm{--}0.4$. The source's X-ray flux within this phase
interval seems to have exhibited a significant change on an orbital timescale.
Additionally, occasional short-term variations in the X-ray band on a timescale
of less than 3 days have been observed. The measured duration of the increased
absorbing column density and the flux variability timescales can provide clues
about the interaction between the putative pulsar and the Be companion's disk
if, as previously suggested, the pulsar crosses the disk at this phase
interval. Moreover, the new contemporaneous X-ray and TeV observations around
the pulsar-crossing phases revealed independent variability in the X-ray and
TeV fluxes, contrary to a previous observation of concurrent flux increases.
While these observations alone cannot provide definitive conclusions, we
discuss our results in the context of pulsar-disk interaction and intrabinary
shock emission scenarios.

Abstract: The X-ray polarimetric observing window re-opening is shedding new light on
our current understanding of compact accreting sources. This is true, in
particular, for stellar-mass black hole sources observed in the
thermally-dominated state, for which the polarization signal is expected to
depend on the accretion disk inclination and the black hole spin. Two main
effects determine the polarization properties of the accretion disk emission:
the absorption and scattering processes occurring before the radiation leaves
the disk atmosphere, and the relativistic effects influencing its propagation
towards the observer at infinity. In this work, we investigate these effects
together considering only the contribution of direct radiation. We analyze how
the ionization state of the disk atmosphere, approximated with a
constant-density surface layer assumed to be either in collisional ionization
equilibrium or photoionization equilibrium, can influence the
spectro-polarimetric properties of the radiation at the emitting disk surface.
Subsequently we study how these are modified by the propagation in a strong
gravitational field.

Motivation: 探讨超高能宇宙射线的质量组成及其对源识别的影响，特别是铁核在银河磁场中的偏转效应。

Method: 假设40 EeV以上宇宙射线为铁核，模拟其在银河磁场中的传播和偏转，比较活动星系核和星暴星系作为源的分布。

Result: 活动星系核与观测数据的相关性更强，但银河磁场偏转显著增加了源识别的难度。

Conclusion: 当前模型和工具下，即使在高能情况下，银河磁场的偏转效应仍使源识别具有挑战性。

Abstract: Recent studies, supported by updated hadronic interaction models, suggest
that the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays may be heavier than
previously assumed. This has significant implications for source
identification, as the deflections of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) are
larger for heavy primaries than for lighter ones at the same energy. In this
work, we assume that cosmic rays above 40 EeV consist of iron nuclei only and
investigate their possible sources through simulations of cosmic ray
propagation, including interactions with ambient photon fields and deflections
in the GMF using multiple models. We consider two types of sources as potential
origins of these cosmic rays, active galactic nuclei and starburst galaxies. We
compare the predicted distributions of arrival directions from sources within
250 Mpc with the measured arrival directions of cosmic rays above 40 EeV. Our
results indicate that stronger correlation is found for the active galactic
nuclei scenario compared to starburst galaxies. However, we find that within
our heavy mass composition model, the GMF leads to significant deflections,
making source identification challenging with current knowledge and tools, even

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种数据驱动的超高能宇宙射线（UHECRs）解释模型，即重金属情景，假设在能量高于10^19.6 eV时宇宙射线为纯铁核，并通过调整X_max尺度来重新解释质量组成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代强子相互作用模型对宇宙射线质量组成的推断存在模糊性，因此需要一种更一致的数据驱动模型来解释观测结果。

Method: 假设UHECRs在特定能量以上为纯铁核，并调整QGSJet II-04和Sibyll 2.3d模型的X_max尺度，分析其对质量组成、能量谱和到达方向的影响。

Result: 模型显示UHECRs的质量组成比传统假设更重，且能更一致地解释宇宙射线测量数据。

Conclusion: 重金属情景为UHECRs的质量组成提供了一种更自洽的解释，对强子相互作用研究和宇宙射线起源有重要意义。

Abstract: The mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is usually
inferred from the depth of the shower maximum ($X_{\rm{max}}$) of cosmic-ray
showers, which is only ambiguously determined by modern hadronic interaction
models. We present a data-driven interpretation of UHECRs, the heavy-metal
scenario, which assumes pure iron nuclei above $10^{19.6}$ eV ($\approx 40$
EeV) as the heaviest observed mass composition and introduces a global shift in
the $X_{\rm{max}}$ scale predicted by the two hadronic interaction models
QGSJet II-04 and Sibyll 2.3d. We investigate the consequences of the proposed
mass-composition model based on the obtained shifts in the $X_{\rm{max}}$
values, which naturally lead to a heavier mass composition of UHECRs than
conventionally assumed. We explore the consequences of our model on the energy
evolution of relative fractions of primary species, consequently decomposed
energy spectrum, hadronic-interaction studies and the arrival directions of
UHECRs. We show that within this scenario, presented recently in Vicha et al
2025 ApJL 986 L34, the cosmic-ray measurements can be interpreted in a more
consistent way.

Motivation: 研究中子星和黑洞X射线双星系统中X射线反射的偏振特征，以理解其观测到的偏振现象。

Method: 结合蒙特卡洛模拟（考虑散射、吸收和谱线）和非LTE辐射转移预计算，分析部分电离光学厚板对入射光谱的反射。

Conclusion: 局部反射特征可能影响远距离观测的X射线偏振，为理解X射线双星系统的偏振现象提供了新视角。

Abstract: X-ray thermal emission is inherent in neutron-star and black-hole X-ray
binary systems. Within these systems, it may reflect from optically thick
matter, which will create characteristic observable X-ray spectro-polarimetric
features. We compute rest-frame reflection spectra and the corresponding
energy-dependent linear polarization degree and angle for (un)polarized
single-temperature black-body spectra impinging on a partially ionized
constant-density optically thick slab. We use a combination of a Monte Carlo
simulation that takes into account scattering, absorption, and spectral lines,
with a non-LTE radiative transfer pre-computation of the ionization structure
of the slab in photo-ionization equilibrium. We discuss the impact of the
reflector's ionization and of the incident spectral shape on the obtained
energy dependence of polarization. Despite the presence of highly polarized
absorption features and low-polarized spectral lines, an underlying
scattering-induced increase of polarization degree with energy in mid to hard
X-rays naturally arises due to multiple Compton-scattering energy shifts. Such
re-processing effect is particularly apparent in 2-8 keV for steep incident
X-ray spectra reflecting from highly-ionized optically thick media. Integration
of the resulting local reflection tables in specific large-scale reflection
geometries occurring in X-ray binary systems, including relativistic effects,
will be presented in a follow-up paper. Nonetheless, we anticipate that the
obtained local energy-dependent features will imprint at large distances from
the source to the observed X-ray polarization, and could contribute to the
observed increase of total polarization degree with energy in 2-8 keV in many
accreting systems by the IXPE mission.

Abstract: Neutrino-cooled accretion disks can form in the aftermath of neutron-star
mergers as well as during the collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars
(collapsars) and the accretion-induced collapse of rapidly rotating white
dwarfs. Due to Pauli blocking as electrons become degenerate at sufficiently
high accretion rates $\dot{M}$, the resulting 'self-neutronization' of the
dissociated accreting plasma makes these astrophysical systems promising
sources of rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis (the r-process). We present a
one-dimensional general-relativistic, viscous-hydrodynamic model of
neutrino-cooled accretion disks around black holes. With collapsars,
super-collapsars and very massive star collapse in mind, we chart the
composition of the accretion flow and systematically explore different
radiatively efficient and inefficient accretion regimes with increasing $\dot
M$, across a vast parameter space of $\dot{M}\sim 10^{-6}-10^6 M_\odot
\,\text{s}^{-1}$, black hole masses of $M_\bullet\sim 1 - 10^4 M_\odot$ and
dimensionless spins of $\chi_\bullet \in [0,1)$, as well as $\alpha$-viscosity
values of $\alpha\sim 10^{-3}-1$. We show that these accretion regimes are
separated by characteristic thresholds $\dot{M}_{\rm char}$ that follow power
laws $\dot M_{\rm char}\propto M_{\bullet}^\alpha \alpha^\beta$ and that can be
understood based on analytic approximations we derive. We find that outflows
from such disks are promising sites of r-process nucleosynthesis up to
$M_\bullet \lesssim 3000 M_\odot$. These give rise to lanthanide-bearing 'red'
super-kilonovae transients mostly for $M_\bullet \lesssim 200-500 M_\odot$ and
lanthanide suppressed 'blue' super-kilonovae for larger $M_\bullet$.
Proton-rich outflows can develop specifically for large black hole masses
($M_\bullet \gtrsim 100 M_\odot$) in certain accretion regimes, which may give
rise to proton-rich isotopes via the $\nu$p-process.

TL;DR: 提出了一种将显式似然转换为模拟器的方法，用于结合显式和隐式似然的高效全局分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决显式似然难以融入基于模拟的推断（SBI）框架的问题，特别是宇宙学中的Planck CMB似然。

Method: 利用已收敛的MCMC样本构建有效模拟器，并将其与正向模拟器结合。

Result: 未来3x2pt数据可5σ检测演化暗能量，结合现有数据可提升至7σ。SBI方法无需调用Boltzmann求解器。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效结合显式和隐式似然的全局扫描提供了可能。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) allows fast Bayesian inference for
simulators encoding implicit likelihoods. However, some explicit likelihoods
cannot be easily reformulated as simulators, hindering their integration into
combined analyses within SBI frameworks. One key example in cosmology is given
by the Planck CMB likelihoods. We present a simple method to construct an
effective simulator for any explicit likelihood using samples from a previously
converged Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) run. This effective simulator can
subsequently be combined with any forward simulator. To illustrate this method,
we combine the full Planck CMB likelihoods with a 3x2pt simulator (cosmic
shear, galaxy clustering and their cross-correlation) for a Stage IV survey
like Euclid, and test evolving dark energy parameterized by the $w_0w_a$
equation-of-state. Assuming the $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology hinted by DESI BAO DR2 +
Planck 2018 + PantheonPlus SNIa datasets, we find that future 3x2pt data alone
could detect evolving dark energy at $5\sigma$, while its combination with
current CMB, BAO and SNIa datasets could raise the detection to almost
$7\sigma$. Moreover, thanks to simulation reuse enabled by SBI, we show that
our joint analysis is in excellent agreement with MCMC while requiring zero
Boltzmann solver calls. This result opens up the possibility of performing
massive global scans combining explicit and implicit likelihoods in a highly
efficient way.

Result: 前景楔形效应在高红移下更显著，避免技术会损失一个数量级的灵敏度。

Conclusion: 为在近期的实验中实现黑暗时代21厘米宇宙学，需采用前景减除技术。

Abstract: Studies of the cosmic dark ages ($30 \lesssim z \lesssim 150$) using the
highly redshifted 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen offer unparalleled amounts of
cosmological information, and recent years have seen the refinement of concepts
for such experiments (e.g. CoDEX and FarView), nominally feasible with
technology and resources in the next one to two decades. This work studies how
the "foreground wedge" -- a term in the 21 cm cosmology literature referring to
the contamination of power spectrum modes through the combination of
smooth-spectrum foreground emission and the frequency-dependent point spread
function of a radio interferometer -- manifests at these very high redshifts.
We find the effect is more significant than at Epoch of Reionization redshifts
targeted by current ground-based experiments, with foreground avoidance
techniques (which discard all $k$ modes falling within the wedge) typically
losing an order of magnitude of sensitivity. Given the extreme faintness of the
21 cm signal from the cosmic dark ages and the very high sky temperatures (the
dominant source of noise) at low radio frequencies, we conclude that some level
of foreground subtraction will be necessary to enable dark ages 21 cm cosmology
with experiments of the scale believed to be achievable in the near term.

Motivation: 哈勃常数的局部测量与CMB结果之间存在显著差异，有人提出暗物质衰变可能缓解这一张力，但暗物质衰变机制尚不明确。

Method: 研究了超大质量黑洞（SMBH）合并、恒星质量黑洞合并以及小黑洞合并形成SMBH的过程，并分析了这些过程对哈勃常数张力的影响。

Result: 发现这些过程无法缓解张力，因为需要不现实的合并速率或过度产生SMBH。此外，利用积分Sachs-Wolfe效应约束SMBH形成机制也不可行。

Conclusion: 黑洞合并无法作为缓解哈勃常数张力的有效机制。

Abstract: The values of the Hubble constant inferred from local measurements and the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) exhibit an approximately 5 sigma tension.
Some have suggested this tension is alleviated if matter is converted to dark
radiation via dark matter decay. As it is not clear that dark matter decays, we
instead examine the effects of converting matter to gravitational radiation via
black hole mergers. We consider mergers of supermassive black holes (SMBHs),
mergers of stellar-mass black holes, and the formation of SMBHs from mergers of
smaller black holes. We find that these processes cannot alleviate the tension,
as an unrealistically large merger rate, or an overproduction of SMBHs is
required. We also consider whether one can use the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe
effect to constrain mechanisms that form SMBHs from mergers of smaller black
holes. We find that this is also too small to be viable.

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) distort galaxy shapes through the tidal effect,
offering a novel avenue to probe the nature of gravity. In this paper, we
investigate how extra GW polarizations beyond those predicted by general
relativity imprint observable signatures on galaxy shapes. Since galaxy shapes
are measured as two-dimensional images projected onto the celestial sphere, we
present three-dimensional statistical quantities of the projected tidal tensor
sourced by the tensor perturbation. We show that the presence of extra
polarization modes modifies both the amplitude and angular dependence of the
correlation functions. Furthermore, we identify a distinct observational
channel for probing parity violation in helicity-two and helicity-one modes. In
particular, we show that if they propagate at different speeds, galaxy surveys
can disentangle the source of parity violation. Our findings establish a
theoretical framework for using upcoming large-scale galaxy surveys to test
modified gravity theories through the polarization content of GWs.

Conclusion: DESI数据与CMB实验的差异导致AEDE参数变化，表明当前ΛCDM模型中存在不一致性。

Abstract: We present the most up-to-date constraints on axion early dark energy (AEDE)
from cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)
measurements. In particular, we assess the impact of data from ground-based CMB
experiments, the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope
(ACT) -- both with and without $Planck$ -- on constraints on AEDE. We also
highlight the impact that BAO information from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument (DESI) has on these constraints. From CMB data alone, we do not find
statistically significant evidence for the presence of AEDE, and we find only
moderate reduction in the Hubble tension. From the latest SPT data alone, we
find the maximal fractional contribution of AEDE to the cosmic energy budget is
$f_{\rm EDE}\,<\,0.12$ at $95\,$% confidence level (CL), and the Hubble tension
between the SPT and SH0ES results is reduced to the $2.3\,\sigma$ level. When
combining the latest SPT, ACT, and $Planck$ datasets, we find $f_{\rm
EDE}\,<\,0.091$ at $95\,$% CL and the Hubble tension at the $3.3\, \sigma$
level. In contrast, adding DESI data to the CMB datasets results in mild
preference for AEDE and, in some cases, non-negligible reduction in the Hubble
tension. From SPT+DESI, we find $f_{\rm EDE}\,=\,0.081^{+0.037}_{-0.052}$ at
$68\,$% CL, and the Hubble tension reduces to $1.5\,\sigma$. From the
combination of DESI with all three CMB experiments, we get $f_{\rm EDE}\,=\,
0.071^{+0.035}_{-0.038}$ at $68\,$% CL and a weak preference for AEDE over
$\Lambda$CDM. This data combination, in turn, reduces the Hubble tension to
$2.3\, \sigma$. We highlight that this shift in parameters when adding the DESI
dataset is a manifestation of the discrepancy currently present between DESI
and CMB experiments in the concordance model $\Lambda$CDM.

Abstract: Simulated galaxy catalogues have become an essential tool for preparing and
exploiting observations from galaxy surveys. They constitute a key ingredient
in modelling the systematic uncertainties present in the analysis. However, in
order to reach the large volume and high precision required for galaxy surveys,
we generally populate dark matter haloes with galaxies following certain
theoretical recipes. Such recipes contain free parameters that are calibrated
comparing the simulations against observations, but the creation of galaxy
mocks is a stochastic process with a large number of free parameters to
calibrate. We present a new pipeline, based on the differential evolution
algorithm, that can calibrate galaxy mocks in a fully automated way for
realistic scenarios with a large parameter space. We apply the pipeline to
galaxy mocks built on a combination of halo occupation distribution and
sub-halo abundance matching techniques. We show that our pipeline can properly
calibrate the galaxy mocks against observations for both $\Lambda$CDM and
modified gravity halo catalogues. This type of calibration pipeline provides a
new tool for automating the calibration of future massive galaxy mocks.

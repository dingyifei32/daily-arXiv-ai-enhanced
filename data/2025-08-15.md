### [1] [Effects of light-mass fermionic dark matter on the equilibrium and stability of white dwarfs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10002)
*G. A. Carvalho,J. D. V. Arbañil,J. G. Coelho*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究探讨了白矮星与暗物质的混合体（DMWD），发现其更紧凑且质量可达1.3太阳质量，半径约500公里，对引力波频率有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用白矮星作为实验室测试强引力和高密度环境，同时约束暗物质模型。

Method: 在广义相对论框架下，研究白矮星物质与费米子暗物质的两流体混合模型，暗物质质量范围为0.1-10 GeV。

Result: DMWD更紧凑，质量约1.3太阳质量，半径约500公里，径向振荡基频变化约20%，影响引力波频率。

Conclusion: 暗物质与普通物质的相互作用为解释白矮星观测偏差和约束暗物质特性提供了新途径。

Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs) can be used as laboratories to test strong gravity and
high-density regimes, once their equation of state is not so uncertain as the
one of neutron stars. This makes them also a useful tool to constrain
dark-matter models. In this work, we study dark matter white dwarfs (DMWD)
composed of white dwarf matter admixed with fermionic dark matter in a
two-fluid general relativistic framework. Dark matter particles are considered
to have masses between $0.1-10$ GeV. The equilibrium configurations and
stability are derived, showing that the DMWD can be more compact, with masses
around 1.3 $M\odot$ and radii around 500 km. The increasing compactness leads
to changes in the fundamental modes of radial oscillations ($\sim20\%$ for 0.1
GeV DM), which produce detectable shifts in GW frequencies. The interplay
between dark matter and normal matter thus provides a compelling avenue for
interpreting deviations in observed WD properties and for placing constraints
on DM characteristics through astrophysical observations.

### [2] [Benchmark of the Fe XXV R ratio in photoionized plasma during eclipse of Centaurus X-3 with XRISM/Resolve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10441)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文研究了He-like离子Kα线复合体中禁戒线与组合线强度比R比，用于诊断X射线发射天体物理等离子体，重点验证了高Z元素（如Fe）在光致电离等离子体中的R0值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: R比是诊断X射线发射等离子体的重要工具，但高Z元素在光致电离等离子体中的R0值尚未充分验证。本文旨在通过观测和计算验证其适用性。

Method: 通过比较辐射传输代码计算结果与XRISM卫星Resolve X射线微热量计的观测数据，验证Fe XXV Heα线复合体的R0值。

Result: 观测到的R = 0.65 ± 0.08与xstar计算值一致，验证了R比在高Z元素光致电离等离子体中的适用性。

Conclusion: R比诊断可用于高Z元素（如Fe）的光致电离等离子体，扩展了其在紧凑天体周围等离子体中的应用范围。

Abstract: The R ratio is a useful diagnostic of the X-ray emitting astrophysical
plasmas defined as the intensity ratio of the forbidden over the
inter-combination lines in the K$\alpha$ line complex of He-like ions. The
value is altered by excitation processes (electron impact or UV
photoexcitation) from the metastable upper level of the forbidden line, thereby
constraining the electron density or UV field intensity. The diagnostic has
been applied mostly in electron density constraints in collisionally ionized
plasmas using low-Z elements as was originally proposed for the Sun (Gabriel &
Jordan (1969a, MNRAS, 145, 241)), but it can also be used in photoionized
plasmas. To make use of this diagnostic, we need to know its value in the limit
of no excitation of metastables (R$_0$), which depends on the element, how the
plasmas are formed, how the lines are propagated, and the spectral resolution
affecting line blending principally with satellite lines from Li-like ions. We
benchmark R$_0$ for photoionized plasmas by comparing calculations using
radiative transfer codes and observation data taken with the Resolve X-ray
microcalorimter onboard XRISM. We use the Fe XXV He$\alpha$ line complex of the
photo-ionized plasma in Centaurus X-3 observed during eclipse, in which the
plasma is expected to be in the limit of no metastable excitation. The measured
R$ = 0.65 \pm 0.08$ is consistent with the value calculated using xstar for the
plasma parameters derived from other line ratios of the spectrum. We conclude
that the R ratio diagnostic can be used for high-$Z$ elements such as Fe in
photoionized plasmas, which has wide applications in plasmas around compact
objects at various scales.

### [3] [Constraints on the progenitor and explosion of SN 2024ggi in harmony with pre-explosion detection and hydrodynamic simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10573)
*Amar Aryan,Erin Higgins,Matt Nicholl,Ting-Wan Chen,Yu-Hsuan Liu*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文通过流体动力学模型对超新星SN 2024ggi的前身星和爆炸参数进行了详细分析，确定了其初始质量约为11 M$_{\odot}$，并提供了爆炸能量、镍质量等关键参数的范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究SN 2024ggi的前身星和爆炸参数，以更好地理解其早期闪光电离特征和观测数据。

Method: 使用流体动力学模型对前身星和爆炸参数进行详细建模，结合观测数据（如光变曲线和速度演化）进行约束。

Result: 确定了前身星初始质量为11$^{+1}_{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$，并给出了爆炸能量、镍质量、抛射物质量等参数的范围。

Conclusion: 研究为SN 2024ggi的前身星和爆炸参数提供了可靠的约束，支持其初始质量约为11 M$_{\odot}$，并揭示了其质量损失率和周围环境的结构。

Abstract: Supernova (SN) 2024ggi is a nearby Type II SN discovered by ATLAS, showing
early flash-ionization features. The pre-explosion images reveal a red
supergiant (RSG) progenitor with an initial mass of 10-17 M$_\odot$. In the
present work, we perform detailed hydrodynamic modeling to refine and put
robust constraints on the progenitor and explosion parameters of SN 2024ggi.
Among the progenitor models in our study, the pre-SN properties of the 11
M$_{\odot}$ match the pre-explosion detected progenitor well. However, we find
it difficult to completely rule out the 10 M$_{\odot}$ and 12 M$_{\odot}$
models. Thus, we provide a constraint of 11$^{+1}_{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ on the
initial mass of the progenitor. To match the observed bolometric light curve
and velocity evolution of SN 2024ggi, the favored model with an initial mass of
11 M$_{\odot}$ has a pre-SN radius of 800 R$_{\odot}$ and requires an explosion
energy of [0.7-0.8]$\times$10$^{51}$ erg, nickel mass of $\lesssim$0.055
M$_{\odot}$, ejecta mass of 9.1 M$_{\odot}$, and an amount of $\sim$ 0.5
M$_{\odot}$ of steady-wind CSM extended up to $\sim1.2\times10^{14}$ cm
resulting from an eruptive mass-loss rate of 1.0 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. We also
incorporate the accelerated-wind CSM scenario which suggests a mass-loss rate
of 1.0$\times10^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a CSM mass of $\sim$ 0.7
M$_{\odot}$ extended up to $\sim1.1\times10^{14}$ cm. This mass-loss rate falls
within the range constrained observationally. Additionally, due to the
constraint of 11$^{+1}_{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ on the initial mass, the range of
pre-SN radius and ejecta mass would be [690-900] R$_{\odot}$, and [8.2-9.6]
M$_{\odot}$, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究中子星在旋转状态下的宏观模型，特别是小频率下的行为，以理解引力与表面效应对其转动惯量的影响。

Method: 采用有效表面方法，结合体积和表面能量密度项，计算中子星的角动量，并在Kerr度量坐标下推导转动惯量。

Result: 发现转动惯量强烈依赖于有效半径，且引力与表面效应导致Schwarzschild半径显著偏移。对于大质量中子星，绝热条件不成立。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了引力与表面效应对中子星转动惯量的重要性，特别是对大质量中子星的影响，为相关天体物理研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: The macroscopic model for a neutron star (NS) as a perfect liquid drop at
equilibrium is extended to rotating systems with a small frequency $\omega $
within the effective-surface (ES) approach. The gradient surface terms of the
NS energy density $\cal{E}(\rho)$ [Equation of State] are taken into account
along with the volume ones at the leading order of the leptodermic parameter
$a/R << 1$, where $a$ is the ES crust thickness and $R$ is the mean NS radius.
The macroscopic NS angular momentum at small frequencies $\omega$ is specified
for calculations of the adiabatic moment of inertia (MI) within the Kerr metric
coordinate approach in the outer Boyer-Lindquist and inner Hogan forms. The NS
MI, $\Theta=\tilde{\Theta}/(1-\cal{G}_{t\varphi})$, was obtained in terms of
the statistically averaged MI, $\tilde{\Theta}$, and its time and
azimuthal-angle correlation, $\cal{G}_{t\varphi}$, as sums of the volume and
surface components. The MI $\Theta$ depends dramatically on its effective
radius $R$ because of strong gravitation and surface effects. We found the
significant shift of the Schwarzschild radius due to the correlation term
$\cal{G}_{t\varphi}$. With this term, the adiabaticity condition fails for the
NS J0740+6620, with the mass about $M_\odot$ for a strong gravitation, in
contrast to the NS J0030+0451 for smaller mass, and many other NSs.

*Noam Soker,Muhammad Akashi*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文提出Cir X-1超新星遗迹中的对称环结构源于爆炸末期的喷流，并通过三维模拟验证了其可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Cir X-1和Cygnus Loop超新星遗迹中环结构的形成机制，验证喷流驱动爆炸模型（JJEM）的适用性。

Method: 通过三维流体动力学模拟研究晚期喷流在爆炸恒星核心中的作用，并与观测数据对比。

Result: 模拟支持环结构由喷流形成，并发现Cir X-1遗迹的点对称结构进一步验证了JJEM。

Conclusion: JJEM是分析超新星及其遗迹的有效机制，喷流在爆炸末期形成环结构是普遍现象。

Abstract: We propose that the recently analyzed opposite rings in the Circinus X-1 (Cir
X-1) core collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant resulted from a pair of opposite
jets at the final phases of the jet-driven explosion process of the progenitor
of Cir X-1. We point out the similarity of the rings in the Cir X-1 CCSN
remnant to a ring in the Cygnus Loop CCSN remnant. While the X-ray binary
system Cir X-1 actively launches jets, no such activity exists in the Cygnus
Loop. In both CCSN remnants, we attribute the rings to jets that are part of
the explosion process in the framework of the jittering jets explosion
mechanism (JJEM). We also identify such a ring in the CCSN remnant 107.7-5.1,
which we also attribute to exploding jets. We conduct three-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations of late jets inside an exploding massive stellar
core, and demonstrate the feasibility of this scenario for ring formation. The
Cir X-1 CCSN remnant has a large blowout, similar to that of the Cygnus Loop
and to a large protrusion in the CCSN remnant G0.9+0.1 . Based on these
similarities, we suggest that other exploding jets inflated the blowout of the
Cir X-1 nebula, identical to an earlier claim on the formation of the blowout
of the Cygnus Loop. We identify a point-symmetric structure in the Cir X-1 CCSN
remnant, strengthening the JJEM. This study further demonstrates that the JJEM
is a successful explosion mechanism to analyze CCSNe and CCSN remnants.

TL;DR: 利用现代机器学习技术分析SKA观测数据，结合21厘米断层扫描和CMB数据，通过SBI框架优化对暴胀模型和宇宙学参数的约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用SKA的21厘米断层扫描数据结合CMB数据，通过机器学习方法提升对暴胀模型和宇宙学参数的约束精度。

Method: 采用基于模拟的推理（SBI）框架，比较神经网络摘要与传统功率谱摘要，并联合分析21厘米和CMB数据。

Result: SKA单独观测的约束能力与Planck相当，联合SKA和CMB数据可显著提升对暴胀模型和ΛCDM参数的约束精度。

Conclusion: SKA与CMB数据的联合分析将大幅提升对宇宙学模型和天体物理参数的精确度。

Abstract: Modern machine learning techniques can unlock the vast cosmological
information encoded in forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) observations.
We show that tomographic 21 cm data from the reionisation era can yield
stringent tests of inflationary models - here illustrated with Starobinsky
$R+R^2$ inflation. Using a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework, we
compare neural summaries (convolutional network and vision transformer) with a
traditional power spectrum summary and perform a fully joint SBI analysis
combining 21 cm data with data of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
Forecasts based on realistic mock observations indicate that SKA alone will
achieve constraints competitive with Planck, and that the combined SKA + CMB
dataset will tighten bounds on both inflationary and $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$
parameters considerably while improving precision on key astrophysical
quantities.

### [7] [Constraining fuzzy dark matter with the 21-cm power spectrum from Cosmic Dawn and Reionization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10176)

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 研究了模糊暗物质（FDM）对21厘米信号的影响，发现FDM会延迟宇宙再电离的标志性时期，并缩短这些时期。SKA1-Low观测可以约束FDM玻色子质量，但天体物理过程会削弱约束效果。

Motivation: 探索FDM对21厘米信号的潜在影响，以利用21厘米功率谱测量约束FDM候选者。

Method: 在再电离模拟中实现FDM动力学，考虑线性物质功率谱和FDM宇宙学中的晕质量函数（HMF）。

Result: FDM会延迟并缩短宇宙再电离的标志性时期；SKA1-Low观测可约束FDM玻色子质量，但天体物理过程会降低约束精度。

Conclusion: 21厘米功率谱数据可用于约束FDM，但需考虑天体物理过程的退化效应。

Abstract: The 21-cm signals from Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization contain
valuable information on cosmological structure formation dominated by dark
matter. Measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum can thus probe certain dark
matter candidates. Here we investigate the impacts of fuzzy dark matter (FDM)
on the 21-cm signals, taking into account both the linear matter power spectrum
and the halo mass function (HMF) in FDM cosmologies. The full FDM dynamics are
implemented in reionization simulations, along with a new ansatz on modulation
of the FDM HMF by the linear overdensity. Not only does the suppression of FDM
halos on small scales give rise to delay of the signature epochs during cosmic
reionization, but these epochs are also shortened relative to the cold dark
matter cosmology. In addition, we find that while the FDM effects on the 21-cm
power spectrum are dominated by its linear dynamics early in Cosmic Dawn, a
correct FDM HMF resulting from nonlinear wave dynamics must be considered when
X-ray heating begins. We forecast the constraints on the FDM model parameters
from upcoming 21-cm power spectrum measurements by SKA1-Low (central area). In
FDM cosmologies with $m_\mathrm{FDM}=10^{-21}$ eV, SKA1-Low will be able to
constrain the boson mass to within $\sim10$% at 2$\sigma$ confidence with a
mock 1080-hour observation, if the ionizing efficiency is mass independent.
However, our results show that realistic astrophysical processes are degenerate
with the FDM effects, which shall severely loosen the constraints on the boson
mass from 21-cm power spectrum data alone.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效生成可靠的星系分布数据，支持宇宙学参数估计。

Abstract: In order to retrieve cosmological parameters from photometric surveys, we
need to estimate the distribution of the photometric redshift in the sky with
excellent accuracy. We use and apply three different machine learning methods
to publicly available Dark Energy Survey data release 2 (DR2): a) Artificial
Neural Network for photometric redshifts (ANNz2); b) Gaussian processes for
photometric redshifts (GPz); and c) Keras, a deep learning application
programming interface in Python. We compare these different techniques applied
to training data obtained from the VIPERS survey. To deal with the
incompleteness of the VIPERS catalogue, we use a space-partitioning data
structure (K-d Tree) to estimate the reliability of the obtained photometric
redshifts. We build a catalogue which is robust to the lack of training data in
certain regions of colour space. We use the photometric data to create maps of
overdensity as a function of the redshift distribution for more than 500
million galaxies. These maps split the sky into several onion-like redshift
slices, which can be readily used for cosmological parameter estimation. On
each angular slice, we create and present maps of the angular distribution of
galaxies in that slice as well as an estimate of the redshift distribution,
$n(z)$, related to the galaxy distribution of that slice, which is recovered
from the redshift estimation methods. We achieve a sub-sample of DES galaxies,
which are well matched to the VIPERS sample with an accuracy of the photometric
redshifts with a $\sigma_{68}\sim0.035$ and a catastrophic outlier rate of the
order of 3 per cent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在模拟高密度区域的暗物质晕演化时效率较低，SHH方法旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过连续函数耦合SIDM与流体力学方程，在理想流体极限下插值Boltzmann方程的一阶和二阶矩。

Result: SHH方法能显著提高模拟效率，中心密度可达传统方法的两倍，且结果与其他方法定性相似。

Conclusion: SHH方法在探索多样化动态环境中的引力热坍缩方面具有潜力，并可扩展至非理想流体情形。

Abstract: We present a new scheme to couple existing numerical methods for elastic
self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) to the hydrodynamic equations via a
continuous function of the local Knudsen number. The method, an SIDM-hydro
hybrid (SHH), allows more efficient simulation of the evolution of
inhomogeneous halos deep into the regime of gravothermal collapse. With the
improved efficiency gained by moving to a hydrodynamical description in
high-density regions, the SHH method allows central densities of two orders of
magnitude higher to be reached in considerably less simulation time than
traditional methods. Our implementation should be considered as the first step
toward a robust SHH method, as we interpolate the first and second moments of
the Boltzmann equation in the ideal-fluid limit only. The simulation results
are qualitatively similar to those found with other methods, although there are
differences in the implementation of the primary physics driving the dynamics,
and in the details of the resulting halo profiles. However, our results
indicate that the SHH technique shows promise to investigate gravothermal
collapse in diverse, dynamical environments. The method can be extended to
incorporate non-ideal fluid terms and dissipation, as needed for dark-matter
scenarios where interactions beyond the elastic regime may be important in the
dense interiors of some halos.

Result: 方法在模拟中表现准确，适用于极暗弱的星系。

Conclusion: 该方法为测量大剪切信号提供了有效解决方案，尤其在强透镜区域。

Abstract: So far, estimators of galaxy shape distortions are only carefully studied
perturbatively in the case of small shear signals, mainly for weak lensing
sciences. However, in the neighborhood of massive foreground clusters, a large
number of background galaxies can be significantly distorted. The measurement
of such large shear signals could be quite nontrivial under general observing
conditions, i.e., in the presence of the point spread function (PSF) and noise.
In this work, we propose a non-perturbative method to exactly recover large
shear signals ($\gtrsim 0.5$) under general conditions. We test the method on
simulated galaxy images, and find that it is accurate down to the very faint
end.

TL;DR: 论文通过观测数据挑战了标准ΛCDM模型，发现暗能量可能随时间演化，特别是低红移数据（如LRG1）对模型预测有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索暗能量是否随时间演化，挑战标准ΛCDM模型的静态暗能量假设。

Method: 分析DESI DR2、CMB距离先验和超新星数据集，研究动态暗能量模型（如GEDE、JBP、Mirage）。

Result: 发现暗能量演化证据显著（低红移z≲0.3），LRG1数据点对Ωm和ω0影响大；排除低红移数据后模型恢复ΛCDM范式。

Conclusion: 支持动态暗能量模型（如Quintom-B），低红移数据对模型支持至关重要。

Abstract: We present observational evidences indicating that dark energy may be
evolving with time, thereby challenging the core assumptions of the standard
$\Lambda$CDM model. Our investigation extends beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM
model by exploring a range of dynamical dark energy models. The analysis
reveals that the matter density parameter, $\Omega_m$, changes with redshift,
and this change is significantly influenced by the LRG1 datapoint from the DESI
DR2 survey. We find that including LRG1 strongly affects the predictions of
these models, especially for $\Omega_m$ and $\omega_0$, with the latter
shifting from $-1$ to slightly higher values. This suggests that the evidence
of evolving dark energy in the DESI DR2 data is driven by the LRG1 datapoint.
When we exclude low-redshift supernovae data, particularly from the DES-SN5YR
compilation, the model predictions are restored to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.
This effect is particularly evident in the GEDE model, where removing
low-redshift supernovae data leads to $\Delta = 0$, effectively recovering
$\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Our analysis confirms that the evidence for dynamical
dark energy is substantial, particularly at low redshift ($z \lesssim 0.3$).
The reconstruction of $\omega(z)$ and $f_{DE}(z)$, using a combination of DESI
DR2 BAO measurements, CMB distance priors, and supernovae datasets, further
supports the evolving nature dark energy. These results favor a dynamical
dark-energy scenario characterized by $\omega_0>-1$, $\omega_a<0$, and
$\omega_0+\omega_a<-1$ (Quintom-B). Bayesian analysis of model evidence reveals
that the inclusion of low-redshift supernovae data significantly strengthens
the support for evolving dark energy models such as JBP and Mirage, while
models revert to inconclusive or weak support when low-redshift data are
excluded.

Motivation: Planck卫星观测数据显示宇宙早期存在双折射现象，同时重子与反重子不对称问题仍未解决，暗示可能存在新的物理机制。

Method: 引入非度量性函数与物质流的相互作用项，计算偏振旋转角和重子-光子比，并用观测数据约束模型参数。

Result: 在非度量性引力理论中，通过具体示例展示了这两种现象可以统一解释。

Conclusion: 非度量性修正引力理论为宇宙双折射和重子不对称提供了可能的统一解释框架。

Abstract: The latest observational data of Planck satellite shows nontrivial value of
polarization rotation angle caused by cosmic birefringence in the early
universe. Moreover, the asymmetry of baryons versus anti-baryons still remains
mysterious. Both of them indicates that there should be hidden new physics such
as fundamental symmetry breaking. In this paper, we try to interpret these two
events in framework of nonmetricity modified gravity. We introduce an
interaction term between nonmetricity-based function and matter current, and
calculate both the rotation angle and baryon-to-photon ratio. We also constrain
the model parameters using the current observational data. With some specific
examples, we demonstrate that in nonmetricity gravity theory, these two events
can be interpreted in a unified way.

TL;DR: 研究了基于图形轮廓似然和Feldman-Cousins（FC）方法的置信区间，发现方法在接近高斯分布时一致，但在超出适用范围时差异显著。FC方法揭示了宇宙学参数的低高红移差异，但需注意固定参数可能低估置信区间。

Motivation: 探讨在非高斯MCMC后验下，不同置信区间构建方法的有效性和一致性。

Method: 使用图形轮廓似然（Wilks定理、似然积分）和FC方法，基于MCMC链进行模拟。

Result: 方法在接近高斯分布时一致（差异<10%），但超出适用范围时差异显著；FC方法揭示了宇宙学参数的低高红移差异。

Conclusion: 固定参数可能低估置信区间，需谨慎使用；FC方法在全面拟合参数时更可靠。

Abstract: We study frequentist confidence intervals based on graphical profile
likelihoods (Wilks' theorem, likelihood integration), and the Feldman-Cousins
(FC) prescription, a generalisation of the Neyman belt construction, in a
setting with non-Gaussian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posteriors. Our
simplified setting allows us to recycle the MCMC chain as an input in all
methods, including mock simulations underlying the FC approach. We find all
methods agree to within $10 \%$ in the close to Gaussian regime, but extending
methods beyond their regime of validity leads to greater discrepancies.
Importantly, we recover a $\sim 2 \sigma$ shift in cosmological parameters
between low and high redshift cosmic chronometer data with the FC method, but
only when one fits all parameters back to the mocks. We observe that fixing
parameters, a common approach in the literature, risks underestimating

Conclusion: CMB调查可探测广泛频率范围的引力波，方法还可扩展用于其他时变信号和其他波长调查。

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) passing through the Earth cause a correlated
pattern of time-dependent deflections of the apparent position of astronomical
sources. We build upon standard lensing reconstruction techniques to develop a
new time-dependent quadratic estimator, providing a novel technique to search
for the deflections produced by GWs using observations of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB). We find that the time-dependent deflection reconstruction is
many orders of magnitude more sensitive than the ordinary static lensing
estimator, and it can be employed with the data collected by existing and
future CMB surveys, without requiring any modification to the experimental or
survey design. We demonstrate that CMB surveys offer sensitivity to GWs across
a broad frequency range: while the sensitivity will not be competitive over the
frequency range covered by pulsar timing arrays, it does extend coverage to
both lower and higher frequencies. Finally, we discuss how our methods can be
extended to search for other time-varying signals, and also how it can be
applied to surveys at other wavelengths.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用晶格模拟直接计算包含高阶非高斯性的标量诱导引力波（SIGW）能量密度谱，验证了其与半解析结果的一致性，并应用于更广泛的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期宇宙过程中普遍存在非高斯性，精确计算SIGW需要全面理解非高斯性。

Method: 采用晶格模拟直接计算SIGW的能量密度谱，涵盖所有阶非高斯性。

Result: 研究发现，即使是适度的非高斯性也能显著改变SIGW谱的紫外行为。

Conclusion: 未来探测及与原始黑洞的相互约束需特别注意非高斯性的影响。

Abstract: Scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) are ubiquitous in many
early-Universe processes accompanied by non-Gaussianity; hence, precise
calculations of SIGWs involve a full understanding of non-Gaussianity. In this
Letter, we propose to use the lattice simulations to directly calculate the
energy density spectra of SIGWs with non-Gaussianity up to all orders. Our
proposal has been first verified to match the existing semi-analytical results
with non-Gaussianity, and then applied to more general cases, including
high-order primordial non-Gaussianities, the logarithmic dependence in
curvature perturbations, the curvaton model, and the ultra slow-roll model. We
find that even a modest non-Gaussianity can significantly alter ultraviolet
behaviors in SIGW spectra, necessitating special cautions in future detections
as well as mutual constraints on/from primordial black holes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前和未来宇宙学分析中的非线性物质功率谱建模问题，并提高参数估计效率，以测试替代宇宙学模型。

Abstract: The present thesis aims to tackle two critical aspects of present and future
cosmological analysis of Large-Scale Structure (LSS): accurate modelling of the
nonlinear matter power spectrum beyond $\Lambda$CDM, and efficient
computational techniques for Bayesian parameter estimation. Both are crucial
for testing alternative cosmologies and avoiding spurious results. We focus on
the Dark Scattering (DS) model, describing pure momentum transfer between dark
matter -- dark energy through the parameter $A_{\rm ds}$. To capture DS
effects, we adopt the halo model reaction framework within $\tt{ReACT}$,
compute the nonlinear DS spectrum, and validate it against $N$-body
simulations. We further include baryonic feedback and massive neutrinos,
finding degeneracies between DS and baryonic effects but not with neutrinos. We
then constrain DS using cosmic shear from KiDS-1000, accelerated by neural
emulators from $\tt{CosmoPower}$, which speed up predictions by
$\mathcal{O}(10^4)$. Our DS emulator, trained on halo model reaction outputs,
preserves percent-level accuracy and incorporates baryonic feedback. Analysing
KiDS shear statistics, we obtain $\vert A_{\rm ds}\vert \lesssim 20$ b/GeV at
$68 \%$ C.L. Combining KiDS with Planck CMB and BAO data, we find $A_{\rm
ds}=10.6^{+4.5}_{-7.3}$ b/GeV at $68 \%$ C.L., suggesting the DS model as a
promising resolution to the $S_8$ tension. Finally, we present weak lensing
forecasts for Stage IV surveys using an automatically differentiable pipeline
with $\tt{jax-cosmo}$ and gradient-based samplers in $\tt{NumPyro}$, reducing
computational cost from months on CPUs to days on GPUs. Model evidence is
evaluated with $\tt{harmonic}$ under multiple scale cuts. To put things into
perspective, the modelling strategies and machine learning accelerations
developed here provide powerful tools for the next generation of LSS cosmology.

TL;DR: DEBASS项目通过收集500多个低红移Ia型超新星，研究了系统误差和校准问题，发现其对暗能量参数的测量有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Ia型超新星分析中低红移样本共享系统误差的问题，提升暗能量研究的准确性。

Method: 利用DECam收集低红移SNe Ia数据，分析系统误差（如光度校准和选择效应），并与Foundation样本对比。

Result: 发现光度校准对距离测量敏感，DEBASS样本可显著提升暗能量参数（w0和wa）的测量精度。

Conclusion: DEBASS样本有望替代传统低红移样本，显著提升暗能量研究的统计精度。

Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have been essential for probing the nature of
dark energy; however, most SN analyses rely on the same low-redshift sample,
which may lead to shared systematics. In a companion paper (Sherman et al.,
submitted), we introduce the Dark Energy Bedrock All-Sky Supernova (DEBASS)
program, which has already collected more than 500 low-redshift SNe Ia on the
Dark Energy Camera (DECam), and present an initial release of 77 SNe Ia within
the Dark Energy Survey (DES) footprint observed between 2021 and 2024. Here, we
examine the systematics, including photometric calibration and selection
effects. We find agreement at the 10 millimagnitude level among the tertiary
standard stars of DEBASS, DES, and Pan-STARRS1. Our simulations reproduce the
observed distributions of DEBASS SN light-curve properties, and we measure a
bias-corrected Hubble residual scatter of $0.08$ mag, which, while small, is
found in 10% of our simulations. We compare the DEBASS SN distances to the
Foundation sample and find consistency with a median residual offset of $0.016
\pm 0.019$ mag. Selection effects have negligible impacts on distances, but a
different photometric calibration solution shifts the median residual $-0.015
\pm 0.019$ mag, highlighting calibration sensitivity. Using conservative
simulations, we forecast that replacing historical low-redshift samples with
the full DEBASS sample (>400 SNe Ia) will improve the statistical uncertainties
on dark energy parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$ by 30% and 24% respectively, enhance
the dark energy Figure of Merit by up to 60%, and enable a measurement of
$f\sigma_8$ at the 25% level.

TL;DR: DEBASS项目通过低红移Ia型超新星（SNe Ia）的精确测量，为宇宙膨胀、各向同性和结构增长研究提供关键数据。

Method: DEBASS利用Dark Energy Camera和Wide-Field Spectrograph（WiFeS）进行超新星成像和宿主星系信息采集，结合DES和DELVE的校准数据。

Result: 项目已累积400多个红移范围0.01<z<0.08的SNe Ia，早期数据发布显示哈勃图残差中值标准差为0.10星等，宿主星系质量步长测量为0.06±0.04星等。

Conclusion: DEBASS展示了低红移SNe Ia研究的潜力，其高信噪比和多波段校准数据为超新星宇宙学提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Precise measurements of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at low redshifts ($z$)
serve as one of the most viable keys to unlocking our understanding of cosmic
expansion, isotropy, and growth of structure. The Dark Energy Bedrock All-Sky
Supernovae (DEBASS) program will deliver the largest uniformly calibrated
low-$z$ SN Ia data set in the southern hemisphere to date. DEBASS utilizes the
Dark Energy Camera to image supernovae in conjunction with the Wide-Field
Spectrograph (WiFeS) to gather comprehensive host galaxy information. By using
the same photometric instrument as both the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the
DECam Local Volume Exploration Survey, DEBASS not only benefits from a robust
photometric pipeline and well-calibrated images across the southern sky, but
can replace the historic and external low-$z$ samples that were used in the
final DES supernova analysis. DEBASS has accumulated more than 400
spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia in the redshift range of $0.01<z<0.08$ from
2021 to mid-2025, and, in this paper along with a companion paper Acevedo et
al. submitted, we present an early data release of 77 SNe within the DES
footprint to demonstrate the merit and constraining power of the data set.
Here, we introduce the DEBASS program, discuss its scientific goals and the
advantages it offers for supernova cosmology, and present our initial results.
With this early data release, we find a robust median absolute standard
deviation of Hubble diagram residuals of $\sim$0.10 mag and an initial
measurement of the host-galaxy mass step of $0.06\pm0.04$ mag, both before
performing bias corrections. This low scatter shows the promise of a low-$z$ SN
Ia program with a well-calibrated telescope and high signal-to-noise ratio
across multiple bands.

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 提出了一种无参数的晕模型变体（WHM），显著提高了物质聚类预测的精度，尤其在传统模型表现不佳的1-halo到2-halo过渡区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统晕模型（如HMcode-2020）依赖多个拟合参数，且在1-halo到2-halo过渡区域表现不佳。WHM旨在通过无参数方法提升预测精度。

Method: WHM扩展了传统晕模型，纳入二维（纤维）和一维（片状）结构，并结合1-loop拉格朗日扰动理论（1ℓ-LPT），形成一致框架。

Result: WHM在N体模拟功率谱中表现优异，精度优于2%，覆盖多个红移和尺度范围，显著优于1ℓ-LPT和HMcode-2020。

Conclusion: WHM作为一种无参数模型，显著提升了物质聚类预测的精度，并已公开为WHMcode，集成到现有工具中。

Abstract: We present a parameter-free variant of the halo model that significantly
improves the precision of matter clustering predictions, particularly in the
challenging 1-halo to 2-halo transition regime, where standard halo models
often fail. Unlike HMcode-2020, which relies on 12 phenomenological parameters,
our approach achieves comparable or superior accuracy without any free fitting
parameters. This new web-halo model (WHM) extends the traditional halo model by
incorporating structures that have collapsed along two dimensions (filaments)
and one dimension (sheets), in addition to haloes, and combines these with
1-loop Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (1$\ell$-LPT) in a consistent framework.
We show that WHM matches N-body simulation power spectra within the precision
of state-of-the-art emulators at the 2-halo to 1-halo transition regime at all
redshifts. Specifically, the WHM achieves better than 2\% accuracy up to scales
of $k = 0.4\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, $0.7\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and $1.3\,
h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at redshifts $z = 0.0$, $0.8$, and $1.5$, respectively,
for both the baccoemu and EuclidEmu2 emulators, across their full
$w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM} + \sum m_\nu$ cosmological parameter space. This marks a
substantial improvement over 1$\ell$-LPT and HMcode-2020, the latter of which
performs similarly at low redshift but deteriorates at higher redshifts despite
its 12 tuned parameters. We publicly release WHM as WHMcode, integrated into
existing HMcode implementations for CAMB and CLASS.

For each of the six pulsars that were monitored on a regular basis by NICER, their rotation phase-connected timing model covers the entire period of NICER observations, in many cases from 2017-2025. For PSR J0058-7218, which was only identified in 2021, we extend the baseline of its timing model by 3 years and report detections of its first three glitches. The timing model for PSR J0537-6910 over the entire 8 years of NICER monitoring is presented, including a total of 23 glitches; we also report its spin frequency and pulsed spectrum from a 2016 NuSTAR observation. For PSR B0540-69, its complete timing model from 2015-2025 is provided, including a braking index evolution from near 0 to 1.6 during this period. The 8-year timing model for PSR J1412+7922 (also known as Calvera) is reported, which includes a position that is consistent with that measured from imaging. For PSR J1811-1925, we present its 3.5-year timing model. For PSR J1813-1749, its incoherent timing model is extended through early 2025 using new Chandra observations. For PSR J1849-0001, its 7-year timing model is provided, including a position that is consistent with and more accurate than its imaging position and its first glitch that is one of the largest ever measured. Our timing models of these seven X-ray pulsars enable their study at other energies and in gravitational wave data."}

Using the row-normalized response matrix and the published unfolded spectrum as a truth prior, we construct an absolute-level migration matrix and generate the event-by-event truth and reconstructed-level pairs by drawing from a two-dimensional probability distribution function. The resulting sample statistically replicates the detector response properties of the Pierre Auger Surface Detector. This pseudo-MC sample allows for the application of classical unfolding techniques (bin-by-bin and iterative Bayesian unfolding via RooUnfold) as well as a machine-learning-based unfolding using OmniFold.

Recent observations have shown a dramatic change in the emission properties of this class of sources observed at low luminosity. We explore the timing and spectral properties of the XRP MAXI J0655-013 observed in the low-luminosity regime (about 5x$10^{33}$ erg/s) to witness the corresponding spectral shape and pulse profiles. We employ recent $XMM$ and $NuSTAR$ pointed observations of the MAXI J0655-013 X-ray activity during the low-luminosity stage. We explore several spectral models to fit the data and test theoretical expectations of the dramatic transition of the spectral shape. We study the pulsating nature of the source and find a phase-connected timing solution. We explore the energy-resolved pulse profiles and the derived energy-dependence of different pulsed fraction estimators ($PF_{minmax}$ and $PF_{rms}$). We also obtain $NuSTAR$ pulsed fraction spectra (PFS) at different luminosity regimes. MAXI J0655-013 spectrum is well fitted by a double Comptonization model, in agreement with recent observational results and theoretical expectations that explain the observed spectrum as being composed of two distinct bumps, each dominated by different polarization modes. We measure a spin period of $1081.86\\pm0.02$ s, consistent with the source spinning-up compared to previous observations, yielding an upper limit for the magnetic field strength of B<9x$10^{13}$ G. The pulse profiles show a single broad peak interrupted by a sharp dip that coincides with an increase in the hardness ratio. For the low-luminosity observation, the $PF_{minmax}$ increases with energy up to $\\sim100\\%$ in the 10-30 keV band, while the $PF_{rms}$ remains steady at $\\sim60\\%$. The PFS obtained at high luminosity shows evidence of an iron $Kα$ emission line but no indications of a cyclotron line."}

The NIRSpec spectrum displays all of the hallmark absorption features of a normal SN Ia observed at peak brightness.

Despite a growing number of observations, their emission mechanisms remain elusive. It has recently been proposed that Alfvénic perturbations can convert into superluminal O-modes at magnetized shocks and propagate in the downstream as a radio signal. We validate this superluminal wave activation mechanism using pair-plasma theory and particle-in-cell simulations. Theory predicts two different downstream modes: non-propagating Alfvénic perturbations and propagating superluminal O-modes. Superluminal wave activation occurs if the frequency of upstream perturbations in the shock frame exceeds the downstream plasma frequency. 1D particle-in-cell simulations confirm wavenumber and frequency jumps across the shock for upstream perturbations with frequencies well above the plasma frequency. Our simulations model both monochromatic upstream waves and broadband spectra with the downstream plasma frequency acting like a high-pass filter for superluminal O-modes. We discuss implications for FRB generation in relativistic magnetized winds."}

One of them is a wide-angle tail (WAT) galaxy, supporting the role of WATs as tracers of dynamically young groups and clusters. Our multiwavelength analysis combines VLA radio data, HST-ACS imaging, COSMOS2020 photometric redshifts, COSMOS2015 photometry, the newest compilation of spectroscopic redshifts in COSMOS, and X-ray observations from Chandra and XMM-Newton. We used these data to study the tailed radio galaxies, their host galaxies, and the group environment. Both radio galaxies are hosted by massive ($\\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\\odot})=11.88\\pm0.03$ and $\\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\\odot})=11.49\\pm0.06$), red, elliptical galaxies with extended stellar halos, as revealed by a color, magnitude, and stellar mass analysis combined with GALFIT modeling and surface-brightness profiles.

A diffuse intragroup medium (IGM) is characterized by its irregular shape and the analysis of the X-ray spectra of the group core reveals high temperature ($T_X=2.4\\pm0.6\\hspace{0.1cm}\\mathrm{keV}$) and an electron density of $(8.2\\pm0.3)\\times 10^{-4}\\hspace{0.1cm}\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. A galaxy overdensity associated with the group was detected via Voronoi tessellation, using COSMOS2020 CLASSIC photometric redshifts, displaying an irregular morphology, along with evidence of substructure. Assuming the jet bending results from interaction with the IGM, we find a high relative velocity between the BGG and the IGM ($v_{\\mathrm{BGG/IGM}} \\gtrsim 540$ km/s), primarily due to bulk gas motion.

Neutron stars are the only known systems in the Universe that reach densities several times higher than normal nuclear density at nearly zero temperature, making them unique laboratories for studying dense matter. Since most neutron-star observables are sensitive to the equation of state (EOS), observational data place stringent constraints on the EOS of strongly interacting matter. In this work, we investigate constraints arising from the mass of the heaviest observed neutron star (a black widow pulsar), perturbative QCD calculations at asymptotically high densities, NICER mass-radius measurements, and the tidal deformability inferred from the binary neutron star merger GW170817. We parametrize the EOS and allow its parameters to vary freely, using observational data to constrain the admissible parameter space. We find that neutron-star observations significantly restrict the EOS of dense strongly interacting matter. While NICER has already provided measurements for five pulsars, the associated uncertainties remain relatively large. In contrast, the existence of very massive neutron stars and constraints on the tidal deformability emerge as particularly powerful probes of the EOS."}

Using current cosmological data, we find that the standard background parameters remain tightly constrained and stable across all models, indicating no significant impact of these dynamics on the late time expansion history. At low redshift, parametrizations with a time-dependent equation of state, particularly CPL, show a $\\sim2σ$ preference for evolution away from $w=-1$, driven by phantom-like behaviour. We then examine the observational consequences of allowing non-phantom dark energy at early times through scaling type dynamics. The data impose strong lower bounds on the steepness of the exponential potential $\\gtrsim 20-30$, forcing the dark energy density to remain below the percent level around matter-radiation equality. Consequently, early dark energy is tightly constrained, and neither scaling nor tracker-type dynamics can produce a sufficiently large early dark energy component to alleviate the Hubble tension. While late time dynamical dark energy can improve the goodness of fit, the inclusion of early time scaling does not provide additional improvement and is strongly penalised by model selection criteria, leading to a disfavouring of such scenarios."}

We present measurements of the parity-odd four-point function using the DESI DR1 LRG sample and assess its detection significance. Our analysis considers both auto- and cross-correlations, using two complementary approaches to the covariance: (i) the full analytic covariance matrix applied to the uncompressed data vector, and (ii) a compressed data vector combined with a hybrid covariance matrix constructed from simulations and analytic estimates. When using the full analytic covariance matrix without corrections, we observe apparent auto-correlation signals with significance up to $4σ$. However, this excess is also consistent with a mismatch between the statistical fluctuations estimated from the simulations and those present in the real data. Our findings therefore suggest that the parity-odd signal in the current DESI DR1 LRG sample is consistent with zero. We note, however, that the low completeness of this sample may have a non-negligible impact on the detection sensitivity. Future data releases with improved completeness will be crucial for further investigation."}

We model various stochastic noise sources present in the dataset using stationary Gaussian processes and estimate the noise budget of the InPTA-DR2 using Bayesian inference, involving model selection, Fourier harmonics selection, and parameter estimation for each pulsar. We check the efficacy of our noise characterisation by performing the Anderson-Darling test for Gaussianity on the noise-subtracted residuals. We find that all 11 pulsars with time baseline $\\lesssim2.5\\,\\text{yr}$ show Gaussian residuals and do not have evidence for any red noise process in the optimal model, except for PSR J1944$+$0907, which shows presence of DM noise. PSRs J0437$-$4715, J1909$-$3744 and J1939$+$2134 show preference for the most complicated noise model, having achromatic and chromatic red noise processes. Only 4 out of 15 pulsars with time baseline $\\gtrsim2.5\\,\\text{yr}$ show significant non-Gaussianity in noise-subtracted residuals. We suspect that this may require more advanced methods to model noise processes properly. A comparative study of six pulsars with data removed near solar conjunctions showed deviations from the parameter estimates obtained with the original dataset, indicating potential bias in red noise processes due to unmodeled solar-wind effects. The results presented in this work remain broadly consistent with the InPTA-DR1 noise budget, with better constraints obtained on noise processes for several pulsars and support for achromatic red noise in PSR J1012$+$5307 due to the extended time baseline."}

In this paper, we investigate the evolution of voids in the Horndeski theory using the effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy. Modeling the void formation with the dynamics of spherical mass shells, we study how modifications of gravity encoded into the EFT of dark energy change the linearly extrapolated critical density contrast that is relevant for the criterion for void formation, with particular focus on the time-dependent parameter characterizing the effect of kinetic braiding. It is found that the change in the critical density contrast is one order of magnitude smaller than the dimensionless EFT parameter because of a slight imbalance between two compensating effects. We then compute the void abundance using the Sheth--van de Weygaert void size function and demonstrate that it exhibits scale-dependent modifications. It is shown that the modifications to the void size function on small scales are almost entirely determined by the modified linear matter power spectrum, while the modifications on large scales are dominated by the contributions from the linear matter spectrum and the critical density contrast."}

The most imminent of these is the Payload for Ultrahigh Energy Observations (PUEO), a long-duration balloon-based experiment that will provide unprecedented sensitivity to neutrinos with energies in the range of ~ 1 - 1000 EeV. In this work, we assess the scientific reach of PUEO. In particular, we evaluate the sensitivity of this observatory to cosmogenic neutrinos and, in turn, to the proton fraction of the ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray spectrum. We also consider the potential of PUEO to probe scenarios in which neutrinos are produced through the decays of ultraheavy dark matter particles or are radiated from cosmic strings. We find that PUEO will be able to constrain the proton composition of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays in scenarios that feature very strong source evolution and in which protons are accelerated to extremely high energies. Although gamma-ray observations are generally more sensitive to decaying particles than neutrino observations, PUEO is expected to set the strongest neutrino-detector constraints above 10^19 eV. PUEO will also provide the strongest constraints on some models of cosmic strings."}

In this model, the dark energy component arises from a non-minimally coupled scalar field, decomposed into a smooth background (set to unity to recover General Relativity) and a rapidly varying, massive fluctuation that decays into the dark matter sector. In the near-GR limit, this setup provides a phenomenological extension of $Λ$CDM characterized by two additional parameters: the present-day value of the scalar fluctuation and a normalized decay rate. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of low-redshift cosmological data, comprising Type Ia Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), and Cosmic Chronometer measurements, we find that the proposed model achieves a better overall fit than $Λ$CDM, while the Bayesian evidence remains statistically inconclusive given the inclusion of two extra parameters. The model predicts a moderate increase in the inferred value of $H_0$ and an improved consistency with DESI BAO data when adopting the SH0ES prior. Furthermore, describing dark matter particle creation as a transition phase in the late Universe offers an intriguing physical interpretation, potentially capturing features already present in current data and providing a promising avenue to explore extensions of the standard cosmological model within modified gravity frameworks."}

We present JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of SN 2025ogs, a normal SN Ia at $z = 2.05 \\pm 0.01$. This SN offers a key point of comparison for interpreting future high-redshift SN Ia samples. The NIRCam light curve indicates a blue color ($B - V = -0.27 \\pm 0.06$ mag) and a moderately fast decline ($Δm_{15}(B) = 1.55 \\pm 0.15$ mag), both within standard criteria for inclusion in cosmological analyses. Its luminosity distance is in $1.0σ$ agreement with a standard flat $Λ$CDM model, as well as with current cosmological constraints from the Dark Energy Survey (DES 5yr) and Pantheon+. The NIRSpec spectrum displays all of the hallmark absorption features of a normal SN Ia observed at peak brightness. We find that the rest-frame optical color, rest-frame near-ultraviolet properties, and Si II line strengths are all consistent with the moderately fast decline inferred from the light curve. Multiple absorption features (Ca II H&K, O I $\\lambda7774$, and the Ca II NIR triplet) all appear at a lower blueshift relative to a sample of low-$z$ SNe Ia. Together, these results suggest that SN Ia standardization remains robust at $z \\approx 2$, and also highlight the importance of JWST spectroscopy for uncovering evolutionary effects that could impact Roman's high-precision cosmology."}

Building on earlier phenomenological proposals, we introduce a barotropic equation-of-state parameter with a sigmoid-like correction to guarantee a strictly positive dark energy density and to avoid early-time pathologies commonly present in previous models. Using this formulation, closed-form analytic expressions for the energy density can be obtained. This, in turn, enables a systematic classification of future singularities based on the signs and magnitudes of two key parameters of the model. We test these scenarios with state-of-the-art cosmological probes, including DESI DR2 BAO, cosmic chronometers, CMB compressed likelihoods, and the Pantheon+ supernovae sample. According to our Bayesian analysis, all rip scenarios yield best-fit parameters compatible with $Λ$CDM at the $1σ$ level, with Bayes factors weakly favoring $Λ$CDM. The mild, logarithmic evolution of the proposed dark energy density prevents current observations from distinguishing among the different future fates. We conclude that, for rip cosmologies to gain observational support over $Λ$CDM, they must display more accentuated late-time dynamical features -- such as perhaps rapid transitions or a phantom-divide crossing -- within the redshift range probed by present surveys."}

Saridakis"], "title": "From Cosmology to Cosmonomy", "comment": "Conceptual and epistemological analysis of modern precision cosmology as a data-driven, law-based science (termed \"cosmonomy''), addressed to the cosmology community and historians/philosophers of science", "summary": "For most of its history, cosmology was a qualitatively constrained discourse on the universe, shaped by limited observational access and the absence of global dynamical laws. This situation has changed decisively in recent decades. Modern cosmology is now driven by an unprecedented flow of high-precision data from a wide range of independent probes, including the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, gravitational lensing, cosmic chronometers, redshift-space distortions, gravitational-wave standard sirens, and emerging 21-cm observations, among others. This observational wealth is matched by a concrete theoretical and mathematical framework, based on general relativity, which provides the dynamical equations governing the evolution of spacetime and matter at cosmic scales. Combined with explicit background and perturbative equations, this framework enables quantitative, predictive, and falsifiable descriptions of cosmic evolution. Thus, cosmology operates today as a nomological natural science of the observable universe, characterized by general laws, predictive power, and systematic empirical testing. We argue that this epistemic transformation motivates a corresponding conceptual shift, directly analogous to the historical transition from astrology to astronomy. In this sense, the transition from cosmology to \\emph{cosmonomy} should begin to be discussed among cosmologists, or, more precisely, among cosmonomers."}

We use two standard sets of cosmological data, one including distant supernovae from Pantheon$+$ and the other from DES-Y5. The rest of the data (BAO from DESI DR2 and CMB from Planck PR4) are shared by the two sets. They are analyzed with the help of \\texttt{CLASS}. No structure formation data are utilized for this analysis and no use is made of the SH0ES calibration of $H_0$. Even so, we find that the flipped RVM and to a lesser extent the $w$XCDM and the RVM with threshold, point to significant evidence of dynamical DE, at a level comparable to $w_0w_a$CDM, more conspicuously for the dataset that involves DES-Y5 observations. We also find that while more traditional models studied in the past, in which there is an exchange between vacuum energy and cold dark matter (through e.g. an interactive source proportional either to the density of dark matter or to that of vacuum) still hint at dynamical DE, the strength of the statistical signal (which we assess through information criteria and other estimators) is nevertheless less pronounced. Finally, we discuss the ability of the various models to explain the data by performing an analysis of their effective equation-of-state parameters and corresponding evolution of their dark energy densities."}

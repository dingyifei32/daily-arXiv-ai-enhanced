Comments welcome", "summary": "The redshifted 21-cm line from neutral hydrogen ($\\textrm{H}\\textsc{i}$) enables volumetric intensity mapping of large-scale structure in the post-reionization Universe. In anticipation of \\texttt{SKA-MID}'s wide redshift coverage and high signal-to-noise clustering measurements, we study the redshift-space 21-cm bispectrum and its spherical-harmonic multipoles as probes of anisotropic non-linear structure formation and departures from General Relativity. Using a tree-level perturbative description for the 21-cm brightness-temperature field in redshift space, and adopting the Hu--Sawicki $f(R)$ model as a representative modified-gravity scenario, we forecast the detectability of configuration-dependent signatures with an \\texttt{SKA-MID}--like survey. We derive the bispectrum-multipole covariance including sample variance and thermal noise and evaluate the expected signal-to-noise of deviations relative to $Λ$CDM. We find that the observable information is dominated by the lowest multipoles, while higher-order modes are strongly suppressed. This concentration in the lowest multipoles is well matched to \\texttt{SKA-MID} sensitivity and to the quasi-linear modes that are expected to remain accessible in practice. The strongest modified-gravity sensitivity arises from squeezed and stretched triangle configurations on quasi-linear scales, where scale-dependent growth enhances the bispectrum relative to the total variance. Our results position 21-cm bispectrum multipoles as a practical, SKA-ready observable for testing gravity beyond $Λ$CDM in the post-reionization epoch."}

The novel feature of our investigation is an iterative solution for the non-linear equation for the scalar field $χ= Φ- Ψ$, where $Φ$ and $Ψ$ are the potentials that characterise scalar perturbations of the metric. We demonstrate the scheme on spherical perturbations - smooth, compensated top-hats of varying length scales. We find that the effect of the Chameleon mechanism is seen most prominently on scales where the size of the top-hat is comparable to the Compton scale of the background. There is a density enhancement near the outer edge of the top-hat and the top-hat does not retain its shape. We explain this well-known observation in the context of the spatio-temporal evolution of the Compton scale. Additionally, we find a slight enhancement of the density near the origin, a feature not reported previously in the literature. On scales much smaller or much larger than the background Compton length, including the Chameleon screening has no appreciable effect on the perturbations. In the former, the growth is enhanced as compared to GR and is almost the same as GR in the latter. Finally, we examine the non-linear density velocity divergence (DVDR) relation and find that for evolution affected by Chameleon screening, the DVDR is no longer one-to-one even for a single profile. The relation between density and velocity depends on the location within the perturbation."}

Collapsing false-vacuum regions first form thermal balls, which subsequently cool via dissipative interactions and stabilize into long-lived Q-balls with nonzero spin. We observe a large population of low-mass Q-balls, as well as rare, massive Q-balls that are several times larger than the analytical prediction. The final Q-ball population exhibits a broad mass spectrum spanning over two orders of magnitude, characterized by an exponential tail of number density at large masses.

The variation of the mass distribution of the LSS of the universe implies that observers residing in different locations may suffer bias in their measurements when they look at the images of distant galaxies. Here, we assess the influence of the local environment on weak gravitational lensing (WL) shear statistics in the context of relativistic $N$-body code, \\texttt{gevolution}. We derive numerical constraints on the cosmological parameters from the WL shear angular power spectrum and comment on the local environment's influence on WL shear. We find tighter constraints on the parameter $Ω_\\mathrm{m}$ above redshift $z$ = 0.2, which implies over this redshift the local environment's impact is minor. We also investigate the bispectrum and conclude that on average the impact of the local environment on $f_{\\rm NL}$ (a measure of non-Gaussianities) is minimal and consistent with zero effect. However, we find that within the assembly of all possible observers/locations, there will also be a few that could infer the parameter $f_{\\rm NL}$ of the order 10.

An efficient sampler propagates quickly in all regions of the parameter space, so that the chain has a low autocorrelation length and the sampler has a high acceptance rate, with the goal of optimising the number of near-independent samples for given computational cost. Standard Gaussian momentum distributions allow arbitrarily large velocities, which can lead to inefficient exploration in posteriors with ridges or funnel-like geometries. We investigate alternative momentum distributions based on relativistic and Student's t kinetic energies, which naturally limit particle velocities and may improve robustness. Using Almanac, a sampler for cosmological posterior distributions of sky maps and power spectra on the sphere, we test these alternatives in both low- and high-dimensional settings. We find that the choice of parameterization and momentum distribution can improve convergence and effective sample rate, though the achievable gains are generally modest and strongly problem-dependent, reaching up to an order of magnitude in favorable cases. Among the momentum distributions that we tested, those with moderately heavy tails achieved the best balance between efficiency and stability. These results highlight the importance of sampler design and encourage future work on adaptive and self-tuning strategies for kinetic energy parameter optimization in high-dimensional settings."}

The subsequent evolution bifurcates: full scattering occurs when the density exceeds a critical value, whereas below it the scattering saturates and the FRB can escape.

Comments are very welcome", "summary": "Quasars accretion models predict a broad range of optical and ultraviolet properties that depend primarily on black hole mass and accretion rate. Yet, most optically selected luminous quasars display strikingly similar continuum spectra. We show that this uniformity can be explained by a nearly constant luminosity to mass (Eddington) ratio, L_EDD and by thermal emission from a standard, optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disc. A standard disk with an Eddington ratio L_EDD=0.1 reproduces both the black hole mass/luminosity distribution of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars and their principal continuum properties. In this framework, the spectral energy distribution peaks beyond the observable ultraviolet range for nearly all sources. We show that the few quasars, expected to be cold enough to shift the peak into the observable region, indeed show this behaviour. This scenario is further supported by an analysis of the relation between the luminosity of the main broad emission lines and the continuum luminosity (i.e. the Baldwin effect). We find that 1) the observed slopes of the line to continuum relations match the expectations from the standard disk model, if we assume that the line emission is a good proxy of the ionizing luminosity; 2) the dispersions of the line-continuum luminosity relations are very small (as small as 0.13 dex), suggesting that the physics of the disk-broad line region system is dominated by only one parameter (the black hole mass) with a nearly constant Eddington ratio. Finally, we notice that our hypothesis of constant L_EDD=0.1 provides a black hole mass estimate (based on the observed luminosity) with a smaller error than the virial estimate."}

This naturally explains two previously puzzling features: (i) the coordinated evolution of the optical and soft X-ray after day 20, (ii) the hard X-ray hump above 10 keV that disappears around day 15 as the Thomson optical depth transitions from $τ_T \\gg1$ to $τ_T \\sim 1$.\n  Our model is over-constrained, and it quantitatively reproduces the bolometric luminosity evolution, soft X-ray spectrum, and time-dependent soft/hard X-ray and soft X-ray/optical luminosity ratios. It also explains additional puzzles: X-ray fluctuations with $\\sim4-10$ day timescales arise from a global radiative shock instability, while the NIR excess and the apparent receding blackbody radius result from reprocessed X-rays in matter far from thermodynamic equilibrium.

It is therefore crucial for unbiased cosmology inference that host galaxy properties be self-consistently determined across the full range of redshifts probed, which we undertake in this study for approximately 2000 SNe in the Union3 compilation (now Union3.1). We use aperture-matched, homogeneously-reduced, optical-infrared photometry from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys to derive global galaxy properties using the stellar population synthesis and SED-fitting code Prospector. We find that the host masses of $z<0.10$ SNe in Union3 were, on average, overestimated relative to the rest of the sample, while the opposite was true for $z<0.15$ SNe in Pantheon+. After correction, the two studies' average distance modulus estimated for low-redshift SNe, previously $>0.03$ mag discrepant, come into 0.01 mag agreement. We then update the UNITY SN analysis and find that the uncertainties on all standardization parameters shrink to 0.6-0.9x their previous sizes. For flat-$Λ$CDM, we find $Ω_m=0.344^{+0.026}_{-0.025}$, a -0.3$σ$ shift from Union3. We then combine with measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) exactly as done by DESI DR2 and find $w_0=-0.719\\pm0.084$, $w_a=-0.95^{+0.29}_{-0.26}$, corresponding to 3.4$σ$ evidence against a cosmological constant (down from 3.8$σ$).

Additional observational effects such as the survey window function and integral constraints also become significant on these large scales, necessitating a careful theoretical treatment to robustly constrain local primordial non-Gaussianities and relativistic effects. In this work, we present a consistent and accurate theoretical framework for modeling the commonly used power spectrum multipoles (PSM) on large scales using the discrete spherical Fourier-Bessel (dSFB) basis. This basis ensures numerical stability and allows an exact separation between angular and radial modes. Using the dSFB basis, we study the impact of wide-angle effects and redshift evolution on the PSM, and incorporate the effects of window function convolution and integral constraints. We validate our PSM modeling using lognormal mocks under radial integral constraints with realistic survey geometries, demonstrating the readiness of our framework for application to all-sky galaxy surveys."}

Focusing on primordial features from particle production during inflation we generate semi-numerical simulations of the 21 cm signal across redshifts 5 < z < 35, incorporating these features. Using Minkowski Functionals (MFs), we analyze the morphology of 21 cm fields: density, neutral hydrogen fraction, spin temperature, and brightness temperature.

Applying our framework to GRB 190114C and GRB 130427A, we find that current observations are insufficient to discriminate between PIC-motivated acceleration and the Bohm limit, primarily due to large uncertainties in the Fermi-LAT band. Nevertheless, future MeV-TeV afterglow observations can break model degeneracies and place substantially tighter constraints on particle acceleration in relativistic shocks."}

This is a direct consequence of lensing being a projected effect. In this paper, we demonstrate how the noise complexity -- often deemed \"erasing the signal\" -- induced by a particular de-projection technique, the Bernardeau-Nishimichi-Taruya (BNT) transform arXiv:1312.0430, can be used to extract the BAO signal and non-gaussian aperture-mass-like properties at chosen physical scales. We take into account parts of the data vectors that should effectively be without cosmological signature and also introduce an additional re-weighting designed to specifically highlight clustering features -- both at the probe (summary statistics) or map (amplitude of the field) level. We thus demonstrate why weak-gravitational lensing by the large-scale structure of the Universe, though only in a tomographic setting, does not erase scale and time-dependent features of the dynamics of matter, while providing a tool to effectively extract them from actual galaxy-shapes measurements."}

While some authors have found two or three groups of GRBs by analyzing only a few parameters, recent work identified five ellipsoidally-shaped groups upon considering nine parameters $T_{50}, T_{90}, F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4, P_{64}, P_{256}, P_{1024}$. Yet others suggest sub-classes within the two or three groups found earlier. Using a mixture model of Gaussian factor analysers, we analysed 1150 GRBs, that had nine parameters observed, from the current Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) catalogue, and again established five ellipsoidal-shaped groups to describe the GRBs. These five groups are characterised in terms of their average duration, fluence and spectrum as shorter-faint-hard, long-intermediate-soft, long-intermediate-intermediate, long-bright-intermediate and short-faint-hard. The use of factor analysers in describing individual group densities allows for a more thorough group-wise characterisation of the parameters in terms of a few latent features. However, given the discrepancy with many other existing studies that advocated for two or three groups, we also performed model-estimated overlap-based syncytial clustering (MOBSynC) that successively merges poorer-separated groups. The five ellipsoidal groups merge into three and then into two groups, one with GRBs of low durations and the other having longer duration GRBs. These groups are also characterised in terms of a few latent factors made up of the nine parameters. Our analysis provides context for all three sets of results, and in doing so, details a multi-layered characterisation of the BATSE GRBs, while also explaining the structure in their variability."}

Beyond this point, the evolution equations become non-predictive and perturbative approaches break down. We show that in General Relativity, a matter horizon forms before caustics develop for a well-defined initial over-density on an expanding FLRW spacetime. The matter horizon was first identified by Ellis and Stoeger in 2010 as a dynamical causal boundary that encloses a sub-region of spacetime where structure formation actually takes place. We construct a multi-scale hierarchical framework for the propagation of geodesic congruences that avoids the shell-crossing singularity by cutting the spacetime at the matter horizon and glueing to another spacetime with opposite orientation. We identify a relationship between the multi-scale hierarchical framework and the cosmological zoom-in N-body simulation approach, and relate the local sub-region that decouples from the Hubble flow to the region of interest in cosmological zoom-in N-body simulations. Most importantly, the multi-scale hierarchical framework provides a more robust way of implementing boundary conditions, which could benefit cosmological zoom-in N-body simulation approaches."}

Applied to the CRAFT bursts FRB 20191001A and FRB 20240318A, FIRES reproduces key spectro-polarimetric behaviours: scattering suppresses position-angle (PA) variability on the trailing edge, while the leading edge preferentially retains intrinsic structure when sufficient signal-to-noise is present. We quantify this behaviour using the PA variance ratio $\\mathcal{R}_ψ$ and explore the joint plane of measured linear polarisation fraction $Π_L$ versus PA variance to constrain the allowed parameter space of microshot number $N$, intrinsic PA dispersion $σ_ψ$, and intrinsic linear fraction $Π_{L,0}$ at fixed signal-to-noise. For FRB~20191001A, the data are consistent with an extended region spanning $σ_ψ\\sim 10^\\circ$--$30^\\circ$ and $N \\sim 5$--$1000$, reflecting degeneracies between intrinsic PA structure, microshot superposition, scattering, finite sampling, and noise. FRB~20240318A occupies a more restricted region, favouring fewer microshots ($N \\lesssim 20$) and larger intrinsic PA dispersion ($σ_ψ\\sim 15$--$23^\\circ$), depending on $Π_{L,0}$, consistent with its observed PA variability. By combining an emission-mechanism-independent framework with minimal assumptions and observational constraints, FIRES provides direct, quantitative constraints on the space of viable FRB microphysical models and demonstrates that microshot superposition offers a natural explanation for the diverse polarimetric behaviours observed in FRBs."}

They are generally standardized under the assumption that they belong to a single population, with luminosities standardized in a continuous (roughly linear) fashion using the observed light-curve timescale. We update the Union3+UNITY1.5 SN cosmology analysis in light of increasing evidence for at least two core populations of SNe Ia and apply this \"UNITY1.8\" model to the updated \"Union3.1\" compilation (Hoyt et al. 2026). In addition to finding evidence for two different light-curve-shape (x1) distributions, we also find that the color distributions are different, that the light-curve-shape/magnitude standardization relations are different, and that these populations have different distributions across host-galaxy stellar mass and redshift. Importantly, we find that the residual host-mass luminosity step found in prior SN Ia cosmology analyses is now consistent with zero for unreddened SNe. We report a significantly tightened constraint on the split in the red-color standardization between SNe in low- and high-mass galaxies. We find that the estimated uncertainties shrink on cosmological parameters when fitting the same SNe assuming two modes versus one mode. We confirm similar trends in simulated data when running both versions of UNITY on the same (two-mode) simulations. For a flat LambdaCDM cosmology, we find Om = 0.334+0.025-0.024 from SNe alone; for a flat w0-wa cosmology, we find w0 = -0.760+0.084-0.082 and wa = -0.79+0.28-0.30 when including SNe, BAO, and CMB. In the 2D w0-wa plane, adding SNe to BAO and compressed CMB increases the tension with flat LambdaCDM from 2.1 sigma to 2.6 sigma."}

Search for Transient Object in New observations using Known Sources (STONKS) is a near-real-time transient detection system for XMM-Newton offering the capability to detect transients in XMM-Newton observations at fainter fluxes than can be achieved with wide survey instruments. We present the transients detected with the STONKS pipeline found in an XMM-Newton multi-year heritage survey of the Galactic plane to identify and classify highly variable X-ray sources that have recently been reported in this region. We examined the alerts created by the STONKS pipeline from over 200 XMM observations of the Galactic plane, screening for instrumental effects. The 78 alerts associated with 70 real astrophysical sources were then subjected to further temporal and spectral analysis. From the 70 sources we identified, we were able to classify 32 with a high degree of confidence, including 7 X-ray binaries, 1 $γ$-Cas analogue, and 1 magnetar candidate. Of the 70 sources, 23 were detected for the first time in X-rays. This systematic analysis of publicly available data has shown the value and potential of STONKS in the application to XMM-Newton observations. It will enable the community to detect transient and highly variable sources at fainter fluxes than with any other X-ray transient detection systems."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "Clusters of galaxies have been used to measure a subtle effect predicted by Einstein: gravitational redshift. This signal encodes pristine information about our Universe, since it is sensitive to the depth of the clusters' gravitational potential wells. In this work, we show how gravitational redshift can be used to test a fundamental physical principle: the weak equivalence principle. This principle stipulates that all matter falls in the same way in a gravitational potential, regardless of its nature. By comparing the amplitude of the gravitational redshift signal with the velocity dispersion in galaxy clusters, we build a novel test of this principle targeted to the unknown dark matter. Our test is sensitive to any additional interaction that would alter the way dark matter falls in gravitational potentials, hence leading to a violation of the equivalence principle. We show that currently available data can constrain the presence of a fifth force in clusters at the level of 7-14%, while the newest surveys will reach a precision of a few percents. This demonstrates the crucial role played by galaxy clusters in testing fundamental properties of dark matter."}

Black hole-neutron star binaries with even more symmetric mass ratios are expected to leave behind massive disks capable of driving bright electromagnetic transients like kilonovae. Currently, there is only a limited number of numerical-relativity simulations of black hole-neutron star mergers in this regime, which are vital for accurate gravitational waveform models and analytical fitting formulas for the remnant properties. Insufficient accuracy of these may lead to misclassification of real events and potentially missed opportunities to locate their electromagnetic counterparts. To fill this gap in the parameter space coverage, we perform simulations of black hole-neutron star mergers with mass ratios $q \\in \\{1, 1/2, 1/3\\}$. We find the gravitational waveform models do not show good agreement with the numerical waveforms, with dephasing at the level of around 1 rad at the merger. We find that the masses of the dynamical ejecta and disk are in good agreement with the available fitting formulas. The analytical formulas for the remnant black hole are in excellent agreement for the black hole mass, but are less accurate with the predictions for its spin. Moreover, we analyze the remnant disk structure and dynamics, deriving the rotation law and identifying global trapped $g$-mode density oscillations. We distinguish three types of accretion in the postmerger and find modulation of the accretion rate by the global oscillations of the disk. Finally, we model the kilonova emission these systems would produce and find that most of them are potentially detectable by Vera C. Rubin Observatory within four days after merger, and by DECam within two days after merger if located at a distance of 200 Mpc."}

High inclination, dipping, neutron star Low Mass X-Ray Binaries (LMXBs) provide an excellent testbed to study the launching mechanism of such winds due to being persistently accreting and showing a nearly ubiquitous presence of highly-ionised plasmas. We aim to establish or rule out the presence of a wind in the high inclination LMXB 4U 1624-49, for which a highly ionised plasma has been repeatedly observed in X-ray spectra by Chandra and XMM-Newton, and a thermal-radiative pressure wind is expected. We leverage the exquisite spectral resolution of XRISM to perform phase-resolved spectroscopy of the full binary orbit to characterise the highly ionised plasma at all phases except during absorption dips. An outflow is clearly detected via phase-resolved spectroscopy of the source with XRISM/Resolve. Based on analysis of the radial velocity curve we determine an average velocity of ~200-320 km/s and a column density above 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. The line profiles are generally narrow, spanning from ~50 to ~100 km/s, depending on the orbital phase, pointing to a low velocity sheer or turbulence of the highly ionised outflow and a potential increase of turbulence as the absorption dip is approached, likely due to turbulent mixing. The line profiles, together with the derived launching radius and wind velocity are consistent with a wind being launched from the outskirts of the disc and without stratification, pointing to a thermal-radiative pressure origin."}

Through over 250,000 trajectory simulations, we establish sharp constraints on when Penrose extraction with escape to infinity succeeds. The mechanism requires that exhaust ejected inside the ergosphere carries negative Killing energy, which is kinematically accessible only via ultra-relativistic ejection deep within the ergosphere. We find that successful extraction with escape is statistically rare ($\\sim$1% in broad parameter scans) and is governed by strict thresholds: it requires high black hole spin (empirically $a/M \\gtrsim 0.89$) and ultra-relativistic exhaust velocity (onset at $v_e \\approx 0.91c$). When conditions are highly tuned to a specific \"sweet spot,\" success rates can reach 88.5%, representing a narrow extraction window rather than generic behavior. Furthermore, single-impulse thrust at periapsis achieves significantly higher cumulative efficiency ($η_{\\rm cum} \\approx 19\\%$) compared to continuous thrust ($\\sim$2--4%) due to path-averaging penalties. These constraints quantify the extreme fine-tuning required for material-based Penrose extraction, consistent with the astrophysical dominance of electromagnetic mechanisms.

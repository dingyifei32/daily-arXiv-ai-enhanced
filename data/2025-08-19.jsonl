Observations by the Event\nHorizon Telescope (EHT) provided unprecedented insights into accretion\nstructures near black holes.

Aims: We investigate how system\nproperties, particularly magnetic field geometry in the event horizon scale\nregion, influence the structure of the observable synchrotron emission in M87*.\nSpecifically, we aim to quantify the sensitivity of observables used by the EHT\nto black hole spin, plasma dynamics, accretion disk thickness, and magnetic\nfield geometry. Methods: We adopt a semi-analytic radiatively inefficient\naccretion flow model in Kerr spacetime. We vary magnetic field geometry, black\nhole spin, accretion disk dynamics, and geometric thickness of the disk. We\nperform general relativistic ray tracing with a full polarized radiative\ntransfer to obtain synthetic images of M87*. We extract EHT observables, such\nas disk diameter, asymmetry, and polarimetric metrics from synthetic models. We\nalso consider a number of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations\nand compare them with the semi-analytical models. Results: We see limited\nimpact of the disk thickness on observables. On the other hand, toroidal field\ndominated and poloidal field dominated magnetic configurations can be\ndistinguished reliably. The flow dynamics, in particular presence of radial\ninflow, also significantly impacts the EHT observables.

We show that the Separate Universe framework provides a\nnatural explanation of the observed universality in the bias of dark-matter\nhalos selected purely by their mass, independent of the spherical collapse\npicture of halo formation.

A spectral-timing comparison of Cygnus X-1 and MAXI J1820+070 in the hard state", "comment": "16 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS", "summary": "Cygnus X-1 is a persistent, high-mass black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) which\nin the hard state shows many similar properties to transient BHXRBs, along with\nintriguing differences, such as the lack of quasi-periodic oscillations. Here,\nwe compare for the first time the detailed spectral-timing properties of Cyg\nX-1 with a transient BHXRB, MAXI J1820+070, combining data from XMM-Newton and\nNICER with contemporaneous INTEGRAL data to study the power spectra, rms\nspectra and time-lags over a broad 0.5 - 200 keV range. We select bright hard\nstate MAXI J1820+070 data with similar power-spectral shapes to the Cyg X-1\ndata, to compare the source behaviours while accounting for the evolution of\nspectral-timing properties, notably the lags, through the hard state. Cyg X-1\nshows no evidence for soft lags in the 1 - 10 Hz frequency range where they are\nclearly detected for MAXI J1820+070. Furthermore the low-frequency hard lags\nand rms-spectra evolve much more strongly during the hard state of Cyg X-1 than\nfor MAXI J1820+070. We argue that these differences cannot be explained by the\ndifferent black hole masses of these systems, but may be related to their\ndifferent accretion rates and corresponding locations on the hardness-intensity\ndiagram. We conjecture that there is a significant luminosity-dependence of\ncoronal geometry in the hard state of BHXRBs, rather than an intrinsic\ndifference between Cyg X-1 and transient BHXRBs. This possibility has also been\nsuggested to explain a common time-lag feature that appears in the hard\nintermediate states of Cyg X-1 and transient BHXRBs."}

It is found\nthat the void-galaxy perpendicular alignment becomes stronger for the cases\nthat the void-surface galaxies have elliptical shapes, redder colors, and lower\nsSFR. The numerical results are also shown to be well described by the\nanalytical one-parameter model derived under the assumption of the existence of\na linear scaling between the covariance matrices of galaxy shape axes and local\ntidal tensors. Our result implies that the compression of adjacent matter due\nto the formation and rapid expansion of cosmic voids prevent them from radial\ninfall/accretion, which in turn contribute to stalling and quenching the giant\nvoid-surface galaxies. Given that the formation epochs and expansion rates of\ncosmic voids depend sensitively on the dark energy equation of state, we also\ndiscuss a possibility of using the abundance of elliptical void-surface\ngalaxies as a probe of dark energy."}

Here\nwe propose a unified theoretical framework for FRBs within the framework of\nmagnetar engine: Most active repeating FRBs originate from magnetars in binary\nsystems with nearly aligned rotation and magnetic axes, some of which with a\ntriple-aligned geometry, i.e. with an alignment with the orbital axis as well;\nwhereas apparent non-repeaters and inactive repeaters originate from magnetars\nin isolated systems or in binaries with a misaligned geometry. By studying\nvarious magnetar formation channels using population syntheses, we show that a\nfew percent of magnetars in the universe can be in binary systems, most with a\nmassive star companion and some with aligned geometry. We suggest that such\nbinary systems can account for the rich phenomenology of active repeaters.

Using\nstate-of-the-art semi-analytic models (SHARK, SAGE, and GAEA) to generate mock\nlight-cone catalogues, we quantify the accuracy, uncertainty, and model\ndependence of each method.

The calibrated SHMR yields\nthe highest precision (mean $\\Delta$ = 0.02 dex, mean $\\sigma$ = 0.14 dex) but\nshows greater model dependence due to sensitivity to baryonic physics across\nthe models. We demonstrate applications to observational catalogues, including\nthe empirical halo mass function and mapping quenched fractions in the stellar\nmass-halo mass plane. We provide guidance: the virial theorem is recommended\nfor GAMA-like surveys (i < 19.2) at z < 0.1 where minimal model dependence is\nrequired, while the SHMR is optimal for high-precision halo mass estimates\nacross diverse catalogues with limits of z < 0.3.

We first investigate this\nproblem analytically and then perform three-dimensional numerical simulations.\nOur simulations follow the propagation of high-frequency magneto-elastic waves\nin the entire crust, and include magnetic coupling to the dipolar magnetosphere\nand liquid core through simplified radiation boundary conditions. We observe\nseismic waves bouncing between the crust-core interface and the surface with a\ncharacteristic frequency $\\sim 1$ kHz, which could appear as a modulation of\nthe magnetospheric radiation.

A significant fraction (~30%) of massive stars in our Galaxy are\nmoving supersonically through the interstellar medium, which strongly governs\ntheir location at the time they end their lives, e.g. die as a supernova and\ngive birth to a supernova remnant (SNR). These dead stellar environments\naccelerate particles, emitting by non-thermal mechanisms up to the TeV range,\nand they are considered as a major contributor to the very-high-energy band of\nthe local cosmic-ray spectrum.\n  Aims. This study investigates the effect of the runaway motion of supernova\nprogenitors on the spatial distribution of SNRs in the Milky Way and how this\ninfluences the deduced properties of the population.\n  Methods. We construct Galactic populations of SNRs by Monte Carlo simulation,\ntaking into account the bulk motion and the evolution history of their\nprogenitor stars once ejected from their parent clusters. The gamma-ray domain\nemission of each population is then calculated, to be compared with the High\nEnergy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) Galactic Plane Survey.\n  Results. We find that including the runaway motion of supernova progenitors\nstrongly modifies the detectability of the simulated emission of their remnants\nin the very-high-energy band.

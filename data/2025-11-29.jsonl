Yet, their understanding remains incomplete. Recent global Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations have raised several questions that led us to question their validity and their extrapolation to realistic particle Lorentz factors, electric and magnetic fields. We want to generate realistic sky maps of high-energy radiation from first principles. We propose a novel method to study the Equatorial Current Sheet (ECS) where most of the particle acceleration and the high-energy radiation is expected to originate. We first determine its shape and external magnetic field with a steady-state ideal force-free solution. Then, we consider the extra electric and magnetic field components that develop when dissipation is considered. Finally, we study the particle acceleration and radiation that is due to these extra field components for realistic field and particle parameters. We generate realistic sky maps of high-energy radiation and compare them with those obtained via PIC simulations. These sky maps may also be closely reproduced using the ECS of the split-monopole solution beyond the light cylinder. The ECS is probably stabilized by the normal magnetic field component that is due to the global magnetospheric reconnection. Our method helps us better understand the origin of the pulsed high-energy radiation in the pulsar magnetosphere."}

Our goal is to constrain the physical conditions and dynamical states of the intracluster medium (ICM) through a data-driven approach. We employ a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to identify the most analogous simulated cluster to each observed system based on the morphology of their line-of-sight velocity maps. The model learns a high-dimensional similarity metric between observations and simulations, allowing us to capture subtle kinematic and structural patterns beyond traditional statistical tests. We find that the best-matching simulated halos reproduce the observed large-scale velocity gradients and local kinematic substructures, suggesting that the ICM motions in these clusters arise from a combination of gas sloshing, AGN feedback, and minor merger activity. Our results demonstrate that deep learning provides a powerful and objective framework for connecting X-ray observations to cosmological simulations, offering new insights into the dynamical evolution of galaxy clusters and the mechanisms driving turbulence and bulk flows in the hot ICM."}

Motivated by horizon-scale very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) including Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and future missions such as the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX), we analyze image morphology and interferometric visibilities to identify observational signatures that differentiate KNS from Kerr black holes. We find that higher-order photon rings are tightly concentrated within the nominal ``shadow'' region and that the shadow develops a pronounced gap at sufficiently large observer inclination. These morphological differences produce measurable deviations in the complex visibilities relative to Kerr black hole predictions. Our results indicate that photon-ring structure and visibility-domain diagnostics at horizon-resolving baselines can provide a direct observational test of the presence (or absence) of an event horizon and thus offer a concrete avenue to test general relativity with future horizon-scale observations."}

We find that the FFC effects are insensitive to the different methods tested and that the FFC alters supernova hydrodynamics is only minor ways. We also present a ``quasi-equipartition'' approximation which can be used to estimate the FFC-altered neutrino properties by post-processing the neutrino signals extracted from no-oscillation CCSN simulations. The relative errors in neutrino number and energy luminosities of this phenomenological method are less than 2\\% for 1D models, and less than 10\\% for 2D models.

We recast the dark sector, cosmic acceleration, large-scale structure, and cosmic tensions as emergent consequences of nonlocal memory and intrinsically persistent organization in a self-gravitating Universe. By introducing a maximum-caliber weight on cosmic histories and a bias functional encoding structural memory, we derive modified Friedmann, Boltzmann, and Poisson equations that naturally generate dark energy-like acceleration, dark matter-like clustering, and scale-dependent growth suppression. We also show how this approach can naturally help alleviate the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, can produce anisotropic velocity fields, and predict environment-dependent halo signatures that cannot arise from particle dark matter or scalar-field dark energy. We also derive a generalized horizon entropy and temperature, revealing a nonequilibrium statistical origin for cosmic acceleration and formulating a Law of Universal Arbitrage Equilibrium that governs the evolution of the Universe, showing that it is expanding towards a continuous form of Nash equilibrium. Cosmological Teleodynamics therefore offers a unified, emergent, and testable alternative to the conventional dark sector, rooted not in new particles but in the intrinsic statistical and systemic structure of cosmic memory, and shows that the universe itself operates like a giant potential game."}

Utilizing the dataset and Effective Field Theory (EFT)-based pipeline described in Paper 1, we constrain cosmological models with massive neutrinos ($Λ$CDM+$M_ν$), spatial curvature ($oΛ$CDM), dynamical dark energy ($w_0w_a$CDM), and their combinations using the power spectrum and bispectrum of DESI galaxies and quasars. Our work also presents the first measurements of relevant non-minimal cosmological parameters from the combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and DESI full-shape (FS) data, which are made possible thanks to carefully chosen priors on EFT parameters. We find that the addition the FS likelihood to DESI's baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data improves the limits on the spatial curvature by a factor of two over the BAO only results, though the improvements are less significant with the CMB data. The dark energy equation of state figure-of-merit increases both with and without the supernovae data (SNe), by $\\approx30\\%$ and $\\approx20\\%$ relative to the CMB+BAO and CMB+BAO+SNe results, respectively. Our FS likelihood also yields the strongest CMB-independent constraint on the total neutrino mass $M_ν<0.32\\,{\\rm eV}$, with the $30\\%$ improvement due to the bispectrum. In combination with the CMB, we find a $14\\%$ improvement assuming the $Λ$CDM+$M_ν$ model (yielding $M_ν<0.059\\,{\\rm eV}$), but this increases to $22\\%$ when using non-minimal backgrounds: $M_ν<0.097\\,{\\rm eV}$ in $oΛ$CDM+$M_ν$ and $M_ν<0.13\\,{\\rm eV}$ in $w_0w_a$CDM+$M_ν$.

(2024a) from the motion of fast-moving stars in multi-epoch HST observations. We performed PSF-fitting photometry for sources in NIRCam (F200W and F444W) and MIRI (F770W and F1500W) and constructed UV to IR SEDs for sources within the central region of the cluster by using HST photometry from oMEGACat (Haberle et al. 2024b). None of the SEDs of reliably measured sources within this region resembles the SEDs computed from models of Pesce et al. 2021 for IMBHs accreting from intracluster medium at low rates. Our JWST limits place constraints on combinations of IMBH mass and accretion efficiency, either due to the amount of material available to be accreted, or due to the fraction of accreting matter that actually falls into the IMBH. Our non-detection then does not contradict the mass range of the IMBH inferred from the fast moving stars. We discuss these constraints in the context of the model of Pesce et al. 2021. We find that JWST limits are more restrictive than the existing radio limits for IMBH masses $\\lesssim 20,000 M_{\\odot}$. It is also possible that the faint IMBH emission is dominated by the light of a nearby star. Tighter limits on accretion onto the candidate IMBH can be placed with deeper observations, a more precise localization of the IMBH, and better measurements of the local intracluster medium density and temperature at the center of the cluster."}

While previous work has focused on point-like lenses such as primordial black holes, we extend this framework to extended dark objects (EDOs), including ultracompact minihalos formed from the collapse of primordial overdensities. We develop an analytic model of microlensing by EDOs embedded in a macrolensing cluster potential and derive the resulting caustics and light curves. Depending on the EDO size relative to the effective Einstein radius, we show that they may generate additional narrow caustics, leading to novel features in the light curve. Applying our framework to the MACS J1149 LS1 ``Icarus'' event, we constrain EDOs with radii up to $10^7 R_\\odot$. Our results demonstrate that caustic-crossing events complement galactic microlensing searches, as they can probe EDOs with larger physical size. We discuss the implications for current and future observations, which promise to deliver a statistical sample of caustic transients and correspondingly sharper constraints on dark objects."}

The exchange of angular momentum-both internal and external-plays a critical role in determining the binary's evolutionary outcome. For neutron stars with relatively low magnetic fields and spin frequencies, whether the orbital separation continues to shrink depends on the interplay between gravitational wave (GW) radiation and mass transfer dynamics. We compute the orbital evolution of NSWD binaries across a broad parameter space, incorporating four key variables. Our results reveal distinct boundaries in the NS-WD mass-mass diagram: binaries with white dwarf masses above these thresholds undergo rapid orbital decay and direct coalescence. The dependence of these boundaries on system parameters indicates that Roche-lobe-filling NSWD binaries can follow multiple evolutionary pathways -- a phenomenon we refer to as branched or polymorphic evolution. NSWD binary systems emit strong and diverse GW signals, many of which would be detectable by space-based GW observatories. The morphology of the evolving GW waveform provides a direct diagnostic for the NSWD binary configuration, including any contribution from an accretion disk. Our models can provide critical waveform templates for identifying merging binary signals in real-time GW data."}

We first survey the Euclid processing pipeline to identify all evident, potential sources of systematics, and classify them into two broad classes: angular systematics, which modulate the galaxy number density across the sky, and catastrophic redshift errors, which lead to interlopers in the galaxy sample. We then use simulated spectroscopic surveys to test our ability to mitigate angular systematics by constructing a random catalogue that represents the visibility mask of the survey; this is a dense set of intrinsically unclustered objects, subject to the same selection effects as the data catalogue. The construction of this random catalogue relies on a detection model, which gives the probability of reliably measuring the galaxy redshift as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of its emission lines. We demonstrate that, in the ideal case of a perfect knowledge of the visibility mask, the galaxy power spectrum in the presence of systematics is recovered, to within sub-percent accuracy, by convolving a theory power spectrum with a window function obtained from the random catalogue itself. In the case of only approximate knowledge of the visibility mask, we test the stability of power spectrum measurements and cosmological parameter posteriors by using perturbed versions of the random catalogue. We find that significant effects are limited to very large scales, and parameter estimation remains robust, with the most impacting effects being connected to the calibration of the detection model."}

Using one-dimensional kinetic simulations, we investigate how mono-energetic and power-law CR momentum distributions influence the growth and saturation of NRSI. The linear growth is governed solely by the CR current and is largely insensitive to the CR distribution. However, the saturation depends strongly on the CR distribution and is achieved through CR isotropization, which quenches the driving current. Mono-energetic CRs effectively amplify the magnetic field and isotropize. For power-law distributions, the lowest-energy CRs dominate current relaxation and magnetic growth, while the highest-energy CRs remain weakly scattered, limiting their contribution to saturation. In the absence of low-energy CRs, high-energy particles amplify magnetic fields effectively and isotropize. We provide a modified saturation prescription accounting for these effects and propose a layered CR-confinement scenario upstream of astrophysical shocks, relevant to particle acceleration to high energies."}

Based on the availability of simultaneous multi-wavelength data and considering flux level as the depiction of AGN-jet activity we identified 11 epochs (named as Epoch-A to Epoch-K) and investigated temporal as well as spectral variability during these epochs to understand the emission properties in this source. The fractional variability analysis reveals that, in all epochs, X-ray light curve exhibits relatively high degree of variability in compared to the optical, UV and gamma-ray light curves. The flux-flux plots among different bands, in general, show weak to moderate correlation with Spearman correlation coefficient ranging from 0.29 to 0.58. Notably, during Epoch-I, we detect a possible orphan flare exhibiting increase in the X-ray flux level ($\\sim$ 2.4 times of the total average flux) but with no corresponding counterpart seen in the optical, UV bands. In contrast, during Epoch-K, we detect a significant decrease in the X-ray flux but no corresponding decrease in optical, UV and gamma-ray bands. Overall, our study reveals several changes in the flux states and complex nature of jet dominated emission processes. In all the epochs, two-zone leptonic model provides a better description of the broad-band emission in this TeV BL Lac source."}

Here we report an unusual X-ray transient, XID 935, discovered in the 7 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South, the deepest X-ray survey ever. XID 935 experienced an overall X-ray dimming by a factor of more than 40 between 1999 and 2016.

The X-ray position of XID 935 is located at the center of its host galaxy with a spectroscopic redshift of 0.251, whose optical spectra do not display emission characteristics associated with an active galactic nucleus. The peak 0.5--2.0 keV flux is the faintest among all the X-ray-selected TDE candidates to date. Thanks to a total exposure of $\\sim 9.5$ Ms in the X-ray bands, we manage to secure relatively well-sampled, 20-year-long X-ray light curves of this deepest X-ray-selected TDE candidate. We find that a partial TDE model could not explain the main declining trend. An SMBH binary TDE model is in acceptable accordance with the light curves of XID 935; however, it fails to match short-timescale fluctuations exactly. Therefore, the exceptional observational features of XID 935 provide a key benchmark for refining quantitative TDE models and simulations."}

In these first upper limits, we investigate a small two-week subset of the available Phase II observations, with a focus on identifying new systematic characteristics of the instrument, and establishing an analysis pipeline to account for them.

While the X-ray light curve exhibits the canonical X-ray emission which is composed of several power-law segments superposition of a giant X-ray flare. More interestingly, there is still significant X-ray emission during the quiescent time in the prompt emission, suggesting a continuously active central engine whose power fluctuates across the $γ$-ray detectability threshold. In this paper, we propose a magnetar as the central engine of GRB 250114A by fitting the X-ray light curve, and infer a magnetic field strength $B_{\\rm p}=13.24^{+1.73}_{-5.84} \\, \\times10^{15}\\ \\mathrm{G}$ and an initial spin period $P_{0}=14.31^{+0.93}_{-3.16} \\, \\mathrm{ms}$ of magnetar, with a jet correction, fall within a reasonable range.

It exhibits exponential decaying tails which contrast to the Levy-like power law behaviour encountered without friction. Such a non-vanishing drift acts as a regulator for the conventional ``forward'' stochastic $δN$-formalism, which is otherwise ill-defined in the unbounded and flat potentials typical of plateau models of inflation. This setup therefore allows us to compare the curvature distribution derived from both approaches, reverse and forward in time. Up to similar exponential tails, we find quantitative differences. In particular, in the classical-like limit of very large drift, the tails become Gaussian but only in the time-reversed picture. As a toy model of eternal inflation, we finally discuss the case of negative drift in which inflation never ends for many field trajectories. The forward approach becomes pathological whereas the reverse formalism gives back a finite curvature distribution with always exponential tails. All these differences end up being related to the very definition of the background which is ambiguous when a classical trajectory does not exist."}

However, assuming General Relativity in the analysis of large-scale structure could introduce systematic biases if gravity deviates from GR at these scales. Modified gravity theories, such as the Hu-Sawicki formulation of $f(R)$ gravity, offer an alternative explanation for cosmic acceleration without invoking a cosmological constant, while remaining consistent with Solar System tests through screening mechanisms. In this work, we quantify the cosmological parameter biases that arise when using a combination of galaxy clustering and weak-lensing data-vectors, the so-called 3x2pt analysis, from an $f(R)$ galaxy mock under the incorrect assumption of GR, using for the first time high-fidelity full-sky galaxy mock catalogues. We employ a pair of twin simulations: one with GR and one with Hu--Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity with $|f_{R0}| = 10^{-5}$. The mocks are built using an HOD method to populate the dark matter haloes with galaxies, calibrated against SDSS observations at low redshift. Using conservative scale cuts to minimise modelling uncertainties, we perform 3x2pt analyses and infer cosmological parameters through nested sampling, validating our pipeline with the GR mock. Our results show that when analysing the $f(R)$ galaxy mock assuming GR, the recovered cosmological parameters are very significantly biased, even when considering conservative scale cuts: the Figure of Bias reaches $\\sim12σ$ for both $\\{Ω_{\\rm m}, σ_8\\}$ and $S_8$. These biases persist even when marginalising over the galaxy bias and baryonic feedback, demonstrating that nuisance parameters cannot absorb the effects of modified gravity. We conclude that incorrectly assuming GR in a universe governed by $f(R)$ gravity leads to severe and detectable biases in cosmological inference for Stage-IV surveys."}

Studying these outflows can inform the understanding of the geometry of the systems, as well as the dynamics and energetics of accretion. One key variable for determining the location of these disk winds is the density of the outflowing material. In this paper we explore a density diagnostic based upon the absorption of ionizing photons by density-sensitive metastable states of Fe XXIII. This can yield a blue shifted complex of absorption features in the region of $6.61-6.64$ keV. We use the photoionization code {\\sc pion} to test how varying the ionizing spectrum affects the detectability and interpretation of these features. We base these ionizing spectral energy distributions on GX~13$+$1 to represent a bright thermally dominated spectrum; 4U 1735$-$44 representing a harder, fainter LMXB spectrum; and MAXI J1820$+$070 representing a black hole LMXB spectrum completely dominated by Comptonized emission.

Specifically, we measure the conditional average density, defined as the average density of galaxies observed around a typical galaxy in the sample. To minimize boundary effects, we adopt a conservative criterion: only galaxies for which a spherical volume of radius $r$, centered on them, is fully contained within the survey footprint are included in the computation. For the BGS, we construct four volume-limited subsamples in order to eliminate biases arising from luminosity-dependent selection effects. By contrast, the LRGS is approximately volume-limited by design. The resulting samples span different depths, providing an opportunity to test the stability of statistical measurements across survey volumes of increasing size. Our results show that the conditional average density follows a power-law decay, $\\langle n(r) \\rangle \\propto r^{-0.8}$, without exhibiting any transition to homogeneity within the survey volume. The large statistics of the DESI samples also allow us to demonstrate that finite-size effects become significant as $r$ approaches the boundaries of the sample volumes. Consistently, we find that the distribution of density fluctuations follows a Gumbel distribution - characteristic of extreme-value statistics - rather than a Gaussian distribution, which would be expected for a spatially homogeneous field. These findings confirm and extend the trends previously observed in smaller redshift surveys, supporting the conclusion that the galaxy distribution does not undergo a transition to spatial homogeneity within the probed scales, up to $r \\sim 400$~\\text{Mpc}/$h$."}

A significant milestone was achieved with the blazar TXS 0506+056, which was found to be in a flaring state of high gamma-ray emission and associated at the 3$σ$ level with a 290 TeV neutrino detected by IceCube in September 2017. This discovery motivated deeper exploration of the theoretical link between photon and neutrino emissions. In this context, simulations of proton-photon interactions in blazars and radiative processes are conducted using advanced numerical codes to predict neutrino spectra. The LeHa-Paris code, previously applied to TXS 0506+056, enables the computation of both leptonic and hadronic components of blazar spectral energy distributions, facilitating exploration of a broad parameter space. In this work, starting from the case of PKS 2155-304, one of the brightest and most studied High-frequency-peaked BL Lacs (HBLs), known for its extreme variability and subject of multi-wavelength observational campaigns, a methodology has been developed to extend neutrino flux templates, optimized via LeHa-Paris, to the full class of HBLs.

The model learns a high-dimensional similarity metric between observations and simulations, allowing us to capture subtle kinematic and structural patterns beyond traditional statistical tests.

These are enabled by a large-scale evaluation of both electron capture and $β$ decay rates, obtained self-consistently utilizing the relativistic energy density functional theory and finite-temperature quasiparticle random-phase approximation. We find a significant enhancement of antineutrino emissivity by more than 4 orders of magnitude due to the inclusion of $β$ decay rates, as well as 3 orders of magnitude for antineutrino luminosity. It is expected that these new rates could help us constrain the model uncertainties related to weak-interaction processes, improving the prediction of antineutrino signal during the final stages of stellar death and potentially influencing the late-stage evolution of massive stars."}

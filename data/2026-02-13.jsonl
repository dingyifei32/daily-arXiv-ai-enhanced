Submitted to MNRAS", "summary": "We obtain three-dimensional distributions of CO and SiO molecules from high spatial resolution (0.03--0.06\") ALMA observations of SN 1987A at two different epochs. The evolution between these two epochs is consistent with homologous expansion. From these 3D maps, we reconstruct the 3D mass distributions of the ejecta in CO and SiO molecules, which we compare with those obtained by state-of-the-art, long-time hydrodynamical supernova explosion models computed with the Prometheus-HotB code for 10 different progenitors, including both red and blue supergiants. The models which best match the mass distributions correspond to explosions of binary-merger blue supergiant progenitors; at least two such models approximately reproduce the observed CO morphology. In contrast, the SiO velocity distribution and morphology are not as well reproduced in these models, indicating insufficient mixing of Si into the outer layers already at the progenitor stage. The theoretical models suggest a strong correlation between the centre of mass of the densest carbon- and oxygen-rich ejecta and the direction of the neutron-star kick. If such a correlation also applies to the CO emission in the ejecta of SN 1987A, the kick of the compact remnant is expected to point towards the observer, at an angle of approximately $45^\\circ$ to the north."}

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "Transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs) are old neutron stars spun up by accretion from a low-mass companion. These objects can switch between two emission regimes: rotation-powered radio pulsar and accreting X-ray pulsar. The origin of their optical and X-ray pulsations is still debated, although one model attributes them to synchrotron emission produced in a shock between the pulsar wind and the accretion flow. The small phase lag observed between optical and X-ray pulses in PSR J1023+0038 supports a common origin. We present a new measurement of the phase lag between optical and X-ray pulse profiles of PSR J1023+0038 and investigate the evolution of the time of passage at the ascending node ($T_{\\rm{asc}}$) up to 2023. We performed a timing analysis of optical observations obtained with Aqueye+ between 2021 and 2023 and of X-ray data from NICER in 2023. We derive updated values of $T_{\\rm{asc}}$ and measure the optical - X-ray phase lag from simultaneous observations. We find that $T_{\\rm{asc}}$ increases by about 20 s per year. In January 2023, we measure a phase lag of $0.067 \\pm 0.018$, corresponding to $112.3 \\pm 30.7\\,μ$s. Since 2017, the evolution of $T_{\\rm{asc}}$ follows a parabolic trend, indicating an increase in the orbital period and orbital separation of the system. This behaviour is consistent with non-conservative Roche-lobe overflow, with the donor losing mass at a rate much higher than the accretion rate. The phase lag measurement further supports a common origin of the optical and X-ray pulsations."}

However, the robustness of this result is yet to be tested. To this end, we simulate a comprehensive suite of gravitational-wave catalogs with full Bayesian parameter estimation and analyze them with parametric population models. For catalogs similar to GWTC-4, confident identification of a cutoff is not guaranteed, but GWTC-4 results are compatible with the best constraints among our simulations. Conversely, spurious false identification of a cutoff is unlikely. For catalogs expected by the end of the O4 observing run, uncertainty in the cutoff mass is reduced by $\\gtrsim20\\%$, but a cutoff at $40$-$50M_\\odot$ yields only a lower bound on the $^{12}\\mathrm{C}(α,γ)^{16}\\mathrm{O}$ reaction rate, which in terms of the S-factor at $300\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ may be $S_{300}\\gtrsim125\\,\\mathrm{keV}\\,\\mathrm{b}$ at $90\\%$ credibility by the end of O4. Relative uncertainties on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ from gravitational-wave data alone can still be up to $100\\%$. We also analyze GWTC-4 with the nonparametric PixelPop population model, finding that some mass features are more prominent than in parametric models but a sharp cutoff is not required. However, the parametric model passes a likelihood-based predictive test in GWTC-4 and the PixelPop results are consistent with those from our simulated catalogs where a cutoff is present. We use the simple focus of this study to emphasize that such tests are necessary to make astrophysical claims from gravitational-wave catalogs going forward."}

Bayesian evidence and parameter posteriors are obtained via nested sampling and marginalised over model choices. Applied to the quasars WFI J2033 - 4723, B 1608 + 656, and HE 0435 - 1223, we find strong evidence for non-stationarity in B 1608 + 656 and HE 0435 - 1223, while WFI J2033 - 4723 is consistent with stationarity.

Such a background signal could be produced by supermassive binary black holes, early-Universe processes such as inflation and phase transitions, or a mixture of both. One way to disentangle different contributions to the GWB is to search for anisotropic signatures. In this work, we search for anisotropy in the GWB using the third data release of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. Our analysis employs both the radiometer method and the spherical harmonic basis to characterize the distribution of GWB power across the sky. We calculate the angular power in the lowest five frequency bins and compare it with detection thresholds determined under the null hypothesis of isotropy. In the 5.26 nHz frequency bin, we identify a hotspot in the reconstructed sky map with a $p$-value of $0.016$ (the lowest in our analysis), which we attribute to noise fluctuations. While our search reveals no statistically significant anisotropy, we expect that the precise measurement of angular power spectrum of the GWB will become instrumental in determining the origin of the nanohertz GWB signal."}

Using a linear combination (LC) pipeline, we obtain a suite of reconstructions that explore different trade-offs between statistical sensitivity and suppression of astrophysical contaminants, including minimum-variance, CMB-deprojected, and CIB-deprojected $y$-maps. We validate these maps through different statistical techniques such as auto- and cross-power spectra with large-scale structure tracers as well as stacking on cluster locations. These tests are used to understand the balance between noise and astrophysical foreground residuals (such as the CIB) in combination with the recovery of the tSZ signal for different maps.

We consider all binaries that have a white dwarf (WD), neutron star (NS), or black hole primary in the present-day. We predict that the summed GW signal from all Galactic binaries will already be detectable 3 months into the LISA mission, by measuring the power spectrum of the total GW strain. We provide a simple publicly available code to calculate such a power spectrum from a user-defined binary population. In the full 4 year baseline mission lifetime, we conservatively predict that $>2000$ binaries could be individually detectable as GW sources. We vary the assumed common envelope (CE) efficiency $α$, and find that it influences both the shape of the power spectrum and the relative number of detectable systems with WD and NS progenitors.

We model it as resonance in a forced, damped harmonic oscillator, demonstrating that the coherent response of the soliton can significantly modify the dynamics of objects orbiting within it. This suggests that a dipole perturbation of a soliton can modify inspiral timescales if the black holes masses are significantly less than the soliton mass, with implications for supermassive black hole dynamics, the final parsec problem and gravitational wave observations in a ULDM cosmology."}

Our results indicate that the mass-radius relations of neutron stars are almost unaffected by the details of the connection procedure.

The abundance of SMGs within a cluster-halo increases with halo mass, mirroring the increase in the total galaxy population. Consequently, the ratio of SMG halo occupation to that of all galaxies is largely insensitive to halo mass, but varies with redshift. In contrast, the ratio of the halo occupation of non-SMGs to that of all galaxies declines with halo mass and shows little redshift evolution. We show that the central and satellite SMGs form two distinct populations in inner cluster-halos. SMGs occupy the metal-rich side of the metallicity distribution, but rarely attain the highest metallicities because ongoing enrichment is limited by gas depletion. The brightest SMGs (S$_{850} > 10$ mJy) are found exclusively in inner cluster-halos, highlighting a strong connection between SMG luminosity and environmental density.

We address this issue through flux-resolved, broadband (0.8-20 keV) spectral modelling and simultaneous covariance spectral analysis during two $κ$ and two $ω$ class observations using \\textit{AstroSat}/SXT and LAXPC. The lightcurves show strong, quasi-periodic oscillations involving rapid transitions between bright bursts and deep dips on timescales of a few tens of seconds. Flux-resolved spectroscopy indicates that high-flux intervals in both classes are dominated by a hot, optically thick accretion disc with steep Comptonized emission, whereas low-flux intervals correspond to a cooler or partially recessed disc and a harder coronal continuum. These transitions involve a systematic 1-2 keV drop in disc temperature and a pronounced hardening of the Comptonized component, with flux reductions of up to a factor of five. Using covariance spectra across 0.015-5 Hz, we show that the rapid coherent variability arises almost entirely from the disc, which exhibits strong energy-dependent variations, while the Comptonized component contributes minimally. The combined results suggest that radiation-pressure-driven structural changes in the disc, with a slower coronal response, produce the observed oscillations, consistent with cyclic disc evacuation and refilling in the $κ$ and $ω$ classes."}

We find that CPL inferences are strongly dataset-dependent. With CMB data alone, the broad geometric degeneracy in $(H_0,Ω_{\\rm m},w_0,w_a)$ admits an extrapolation tail that can extend to $q_0<-1$ (super-acceleration), whereas adding DESI DR2 BAO pulls the reconstruction toward a weakly accelerating or nearly coasting present-day Universe ($q_0\\simeq 0$). In contrast, combining CMB with PP\\&SH0ES and BAOtr yields a conventional moderately accelerating expansion ($-1<q_0\\lesssim 0$) and substantially reduces the Hubble tension. Across all combinations, $w(z\\to\\infty)=w_0+w_a<-1$, while at post-recombination redshifts the expansion remains matter dominated ($q\\to1/2$). The origin of this behavior can be traced to low-redshift distance information: BAOtr and DESI prefer different BAO distance ratios at $z\\lesssim 0.5$, which propagates into divergent expansion histories in CPL. In all cases, $r_{\\rm d}$ stays nearly unchanged, indicating that shifts in $H_0$ arise from late-time expansion freedom rather than early-Universe physics. Bayesian evidence mirrors this contingency: it is strong for CPL mainly when PP\\&SH0ES and/or BAOtr are included, while it is inconclusive for CMB-only and CMB+DESI and moderately favors $Λ$CDM for CMB+SDSS. Overall, our results show that the apparent support for CPL and its ability to ease the Hubble tension are not universal but depend sensitively on the adopted low-redshift distance data, motivating either more flexible late-time models or closer scrutiny of residual systematics in current BAO determinations."}

We develop a semi-analytical general relativistic framework that extends classical compressional amplification models by incorporating rotational shear, and apply it to large-scale poloidal magnetic field evolution in accretion flows around a Schwarzschild black hole. By parameterizing the azimuthal velocity as a fraction of the Keplerian value ($ξ\\in [0,1]$), from purely radial infall ($ξ=0$) to Keplerian rotation ($ξ=1$), we examine the combined effects of radial compression and shear. Purely radial flows maximize amplification of both $B_r$ and $B_θ$ due to strong compression. In rotating flows, a distinct dichotomy emerges: sub-Keplerian regimes ($ξ<1$) preferentially enhance $B_r$, whereas Keplerian rotation strengthens $B_θ$ via shear. The transition from subsonic outer regions to supersonic relativistic inner regions further accelerates magnetic growth, revealing effects absent in earlier analytical treatments. These results show that rotational support controls both amplification efficiency and magnetic geometry, with sub-Keplerian phases particularly favorable for advecting the radial flux required for MAD formation.

We apply our model to the original EHT image of M87*, as well as to the reanalyzed image from the PRIMO algorithm, providing generic, simultaneous constraints on the mass of the black hole and properties of the accretion disk emission. While current images lack the resolution to confidently detect the photon ring, the consideration of multiple image parameters are found to contain enough information to provide constraints on the inner edge of the accretion disk along with the black hole mass.

While some of their spectroscopic features have been analysed in detail, the appearance of broad absorptions in the optical regime has been traditionally neglected. In this work, we introduce the first population study dedicated to these features with the aim to understand their fundamental properties and discuss them in the context of their origin. We complement the study with a spectroscopic database of six low-mass X-ray binaries during outburst, in order to assess their evolution. We find that broad absorptions are ubiquitous, with the majority of black hole low-mass X-ray binaries exhibiting them in spite of a typically scarce outburst coverage. Their detection does not depend on the orbital inclination or the compact object nature, but they seem favoured in systems with orbital periods shorter than < 11 h. They predominantly occur in the hydrogen Balmer series, being stronger at shorter wavelengths, and they are detected across all X-ray states. We find that the normalised depth of these broad absorptions is anti-correlated with the system luminosity, and that they show constant line ratios over the whole sample. Based on these properties, we favour a scenario where BAs arise from a stable, optically thick layer of the accretion disc, below the hotter chromosphere-like region producing the emission line components. Our study is consistent with the continuous presence of broad absorptions during the whole outburst, with their visibility being conditioned by the emission lines filling the broad absorption profile and veiling by the X-ray reprocessed continuum."}

Understanding the evolution and timing of the EoR is crucial for both astrophysics and cosmology, and a wealth of information on the first sources can be extracted from the study of ionized bubbles. Nevertheless, directly mapping bubbles is challenging due to the high redshifts involved, possible selection biases, and foregrounds in 21-cm maps. Here, we exploit the real-space cross-correlation $ξ_{21,ν}$ between 21-cm and line-intensity mapping (LIM) signals to reconstruct the evolution of bubble sizes during reionization. For the first time, we show that $ξ_{21,ν}(r)$ departs from a saturation level for each separation $r$ when bubbles of size $r$ begin to form, providing a handle for the onset of bubbles of each radius. Moreover, we demonstrate that $ξ_{21,ν}$ evolves from positive to negative as the EoR progresses, reaching a minimum (i.e. maximum anti-correlation) when bubbles of radius $r$ reach peak abundance. We show that these results are robust to changes in the astrophysical model as well as the timing/topology of reionization. This real-space observable complements usual Fourier-space estimators by capturing the localized nature of bubbles, offering new insights into the sources driving cosmic reionization."}

For catalogs expected by the end of the O4 observing run, uncertainty in the cutoff mass is reduced by $\\gtrsim20\\%$, but a cutoff at $40$-$50M_\\odot$ yields only a lower bound on the $^{12}\\mathrm{C}(α,γ)^{16}\\mathrm{O}$ reaction rate, which in terms of the S-factor at $300\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ may be $S_{300}\\gtrsim125\\,\\mathrm{keV}\\,\\mathrm{b}$ at $90\\%$ credibility by the end of O4. Relative uncertainties on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ from gravitational-wave data alone can still be up to $100\\%$. We also analyze GWTC-4 with the nonparametric PixelPop population model, finding that some mass features are more prominent than in parametric models but a sharp cutoff is not required. However, the parametric model passes a likelihood-based predictive test in GWTC-4 and the PixelPop results are consistent with those from our simulated catalogs where a cutoff is present. We use the simple focus of this study to emphasize that such tests are necessary to make astrophysical claims from gravitational-wave catalogs going forward."}

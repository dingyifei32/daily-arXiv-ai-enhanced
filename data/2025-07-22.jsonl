Each detection includes probabilistic membership assignments for\nthe KiDS-DR4 galaxies within the magnitude range 15<r'<24. Methods. Using the\nAdaptive Matched Identifier of Clustered Objects (AMICO) algorithm, we\nidentified 23965 clusters over an effective area of about 839 deg2 in the\nredshift range $0.1\\le z \\le0.9$, with a signal-to-noise ratio $S/N>3.5$. The\nsample is highly homogeneous across the entire survey thanks to the restrictive\ngalaxy selection criteria we adopted.

We introduced algorithmic enhancements to AMICO to mitigate\nborder effects among neighbor tiles. Quality flags are also provided for each\ncluster detection. The sample purity and completeness assessments have been\nestimated using the SinFoniA data driven approach, thus avoiding strong\nassumptions embedded in numerical simulations.

Here we\ntackle the problem via a semi-empirical approach with minimal assumptions and\ndata-driven inputs. This is firmly grounded on a continuity plus Smoluchowski\nequation framework that allows to unitarily describe the two primary modes of\nBH growth: gas accretion and binary mergers. Key quantities related to the\nlatter processes are incorporated through educated parameterizations, and then\nconstrained in a Bayesian setup from joint observational estimates of the local\nBH mass function, of the large-scale BH clustering, and of the nano-Hz\nstochastic gravitational wave (GW) background measured from Pulsar Timimg Array\n(PTA) experiments. We find that the BH accretion-related parameters are\nstrongly dependent on the local BH mass function determination: higher\nnormalizations and flatter high-mass slopes in the latter imply lower radiative\nefficiencies and mean Eddington ratios with a stronger redshift evolution.\nAdditionally, the binary BH merger rate is estimated to be a fraction $\\lesssim\n10^{-1}$ of the galaxy merger rate derived from galaxy pairs counts by JWST,\nand constrained not to exceed the latter at $\\gtrsim 2\\sigma$. Relatedly, we\nhighlight hints of a possible tension between current constraints on BH\ndemographics and the interpretation of the nano-Hz GW background as\npredominantly caused by binary BH mergers.

We focus on the cases with bound post-explosion orbits, where the\nneutron star may periodically gravitationally capture gas from the companion.\nWe find that neutron star accretion must occur if the pre-supernova binary\nseparation is less than about 20 Rsun. This is because the stellar radius\nexpands beyond this radius before the shock-inflated envelope undergoes\nKelvin-Helmholtz contraction back to the main sequence. We then consider the\ninternal shocks formed between adjacent episodes of disk wind. The shocks\nefficiently convert the wind kinetic energy into radiation (due to\ninverse-Compton cooling), which heats up the supernova ejecta located at much\nlarger radii. The extra heating powers bright optical emission that is\nperiodically modulated on the orbital timescale. The shocks also accelerate\nnon-thermal particles which produce gamma-ray and neutrino emission from 100\nMeV to 10 PeV via hardronic pp collisions. The high-energy photons leak out of\nthe supernova ejecta after a delay of several months to one year.\nPhoto-ionization of the slowest parts of the disk wind produces hydrogen\nrecombination lines.

Precisely measuring the atmospheric\nmuon flux from a few GeV to several PeV is valuable for advancing our\nunderstanding of cosmic-ray interactions and testing hadronic interaction\nmodels.

Nebular spectroscopy further constrains the progenitor\nRSG's luminosity log\\,$L_{\\rm prog}$, and is employed to remove the\ndegeneracies in light curve modeling. The comparison between log\\,$L_{\\rm\nprog}$-$M_{\\rm Henv}$ reveals that $M_{\\rm Henv}$ spans a broad range at the\nsame log\\,$L_{\\rm prog}$, and almost all SNe II have lower $M_{\\rm Henv}$ than\nthe prediction of the default stellar wind models.

Although binary interaction offers a compelling explanation for\nthe non-monotonicity and large scatter in the log\\,$L_{\\rm prog}$-$M_{\\rm\nHenv}$ relation, the high occurrence rate of partially-stripped RSGs cannot be\naccounted for by stable binary mass transfer alone without fine-tuned orbital\nparameters.

Within this context, the radio band of the EM\nspectrum presents unique challenges. Sensitive radio facilities capable of\ndetecting the faint radio afterglow seen in GW170817, and with sufficient\nangular resolution, have small fields of view compared to typical GW\nlocalization areas. Additionally, theoretical models predict that the radio\nemission from binary neutron star mergers can evolve over weeks to years,\nnecessitating long-term monitoring to probe the physics of the various\npost-merger ejecta components. These constraints, combined with limited radio\nobserving resources, make the development of more coordinated follow-up\nstrategies essential -- especially as the next generation of GW detectors\npromise a dramatic increase in detection rates. Here, we present RADAR, a\nframework designed to address these challenges by promoting community-driven\ninformation sharing, federated data analysis, and system resilience, while\nintegrating AI methods for both GW signal identification and radio data\naggregation.

In this study, we extend the code to incorporate a\nstratified radial profile, enabling it to model jets with arbitrary\naxisymmetric two-dimensional structures. The radial profile leads to the\nformation of a reverse shock. We modeled the shock system using an energy\nconservation prescription, which differs from the pressure balance approach.\nThis leads to remarkably different predictions for reverse shock emission. In\nparticular, we find that the reverse shock emission in the thin shell case is\nsignificantly overestimated in analytic models. We also explore the off-axis\nreverse shock emission from structured jets, where the cores belong to thick\nshell cases and the wings belong to thin shell cases. We have confirmed the\nprediction that off-axis observers may see a thin-to-thick transition, but we\nfind that the light curve morphology is hard to distinguish from pure thin or\nthick shell cases.

In\nparticular, there is a lack of observations between chirp masses of 10 and 12\n$M_\\odot$.

These pulsars require models\nspecifically tailored to account for their unique accretion physics, distinct\nfrom those used for Galactic black hole binaries. The X-ray spectra of all\nGalactic accreting X-ray pulsars (including sources in the Magellanic Clouds)\nare dominated by a high energy cut-off power-law and some of the sources show a\nsoft excess, some emission lines, cyclotron absorption features, etc. In this\nwork, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of the broadband X-ray spectra of\nfive ULX pulsars using simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations and show\nthat their X-ray spectra can be effectively described by spectral models,\nsimilar to those used for the local accretion-powered X-ray pulsars. A soft\nexcess is detected in all the sources which is also consistent with the local\nX-ray pulsars that have low absorption column density. We have marginal\ndetection or low upper limit on the presence of the iron K-alpha emission line\nfrom these sources, which is a key difference of the ULX pulsars with the local\naccreting X-ray pulsars.

However,\nmodeling the pair cascades in the polar cap region poses significant\nchallenges, particularly under conditions of high plasma multiplicity.\nTraditional Particle-in-Cell (PIC) methods often face rapidly increasing\ncomputational costs as the multiplicity grows exponentially. To address this\nissue, we present a new simulation code using the Vlasov method, which\nefficiently simulates the evolution of charged particle distribution functions\nin phase space without a proportional increase in computational expense at high\nmultiplicities. We apply this code to study $e^\\pm$ pair cascades in 1D,\nincorporating key physical processes such as curvature radiation, radiative\ncooling, and magnetic pair production. We study both the Ruderman-Sutherland\n(RS) and the Space-charge-limited Flow (SCLF) regimes, and find quasiperiodic\ngap formation and pair production bursts in both cases. These features produce\nstrong electric field oscillations, potentially enabling coherent low-frequency\nradio emission. We construct a unified analytic model that describes the key\nfeatures of the polar cap cascade, which can be used to estimate the return\ncurrent heating rate that can be used to inform X-ray hotspot models. Spectral\nanalysis shows that a significant amount of energy is carried in superluminal\nmodes -- collective excitations that could connect to observed radio features.\nOur results align with previous PIC studies while offering enhanced fidelity in\nboth dense and rarefied regions."}

The simulations span a range of accretion rates, two black\nhole spins, and two magnetic field topologies, and include resolution studies\nas well as comparisons with non-radiative models. Super-Eddington accretion\nflows consistently develop geometrically thick disks supported by radiation\npressure, regardless of magnetic field configuration. Radiation generated in\nthe inner disk drives substantial outflows, forming conical funnel regions that\nlimit photon escape and result in very low radiation efficiency. The accretion\nflows are highly turbulent with thermal energy transport dominated by radiation\nadvection rather than diffusion. Angular momentum is primarily carried outward\nby Maxwell stress, with turbulent Reynolds stress playing a subdominant role.\nBoth strong and weak jets are produced. Strong jets arise from sufficient net\nvertical magnetic flux and rapid black hole spin and can effectively evacuate\nthe funnel, enabling radiation to escape through strong geometric beaming. In\ncontrast, weak jets fail to clear the funnel, which becomes obscured by\nradiation-driven outflows and leads to distinct observational signatures.\nSpiral structures are observed in the plunging region, behaving like density\nwaves. These super-Eddington models are applicable to a variety of astronomical\nsystems, including ultraluminous X-ray sources, little red dots, and black hole\ntransients."}

We propose that tidal disruption of a\nsupernova (TDS) by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) can produce nuclear\ntransients that are even more luminous than typical TDEs and are not limited by\nthe SMBH mass. In this scenario, the SMBH can capture the supernova ejecta,\nwhich subsequently self-intersects and circularizes into an accretion disk.\nBased on hydrodynamical simulations, we find that the accretion rate of the TDS\ndisk exhibits a slow decline that can last for months to decades.

We explore frequency-dependent changes in pulsar radio emission by\nanalyzing their profile widths and emission heights, assessing whether the\nsimple radius-to-frequency mapping (RFM) or the fan beam model can describe the\ndata. Methods. Using wideband (704-4032 MHz) Murriyang (Parkes) observations of\nover 100 pulsars, we measured profile widths at multiple intensity levels, fit\nGaussian components, and used aberration-retardation effects to estimate\nemission altitudes. We compared trends in width evolution and emission height\nwith a fan beam model. Results. Similar to other recent studies, we find that\nwhile many pulsars show profiles narrowing with increasing frequency, a\nsubstantial fraction show the reverse. The Gaussian decomposition of the\nprofiles reveals that the peak locations of the components vary little with\nfrequency. However, the component widths do, in general, narrow with increasing\nfrequency. This argues that propagation effects are responsible for the width\nevolution of the profiles rather than emission height. Overall, the evolution\nof the emission height with frequency is unclear, and clouded by the\nassumptions in the model. Spin-down luminosity correlates weakly with profile\nnarrowing but not with emission height. Conclusions. The classic picture where\npulsars emit at a single emission height which decreases with increasing\nobserving frequency cannot explain the diversity in behavior observed here.\nInstead, pulsar beams likely originate from extended regions at multiple\naltitudes, with fan-beam or patchy structures dominating their frequency\nevolution.

One of these processes is the\nacceleration of non-thermal ions, which will, eventually, reach relativistic\nspeeds and become cosmic rays. This process is difficult to simulate in a\ncomputer model because it requires both macro-physics (the overall shape of the\nshock) and micro-physics (the interaction between individual particles and the\nmagnetic field). The combined PIC-MHD method is one of several options to get\naround this problem. It is based on the assumption that a plasma can be\ndescribed as a combination of a thermal gas, which can be accurately described\nas a fluid using grid-based magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and a small non-thermal\ncomponent which has to be described as individual particles using\nparticle-in-cell (PIC). By combining aspects of both methods, we reduce the\ncomputational costs while maintaining the ability to trace the acceleration of\nindividual particles. We apply this method to a variety of astrophysical shock\nconfigurations to investigate if, and how, they can contribute to the cosmic\nray spectrum."}

This approach has core benefits over previous\napproaches, since it does not require any ad-hoc thresholds (such as\nover-density criteria), it includes the gravitational effect of all particles\nin the binding criterion (improving over widely used self-potential binding\nchecks) and it only operates with instantaneous information (making it simpler\nthan approaches based on dynamical histories). We show that particles typically\nbecome bound between their first peri- and apo-centeric passage and that bound\nand unbound populations show very distinct characteristics through their\ndistribution in phase space, their density profiles, their virial ratios, and\ntheir redshift evolution. Our findings suggest that it is possible to\nunderstand haloes as two-component systems, with one component being bound,\nvirialized, of finite extent and evolving slowly in quasi-equilibrium and the\nother component being unbound, unvirialized and evolving rapidly."}

We\nmeasure the expansion of the forward shock in the bright southern rim to be\n$0.\\!^{\\prime\\prime}10 \\pm 0.\\!^{\\prime\\prime}02$ over the $\\sim14.5$ yr\nbaseline, which corresponds to a velocity of $1620\\pm400~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$\nafter accounting for several instrumental effects. We measure an expansion of\n$0.\\!^{\\prime\\prime}23 \\pm 0.\\!^{\\prime\\prime}02$ and a shock velocity of\n$3840\\pm260~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$ for two features in an apparent blowout region\nin the northeast. The emission-measure-weighted average temperature inferred\nfrom X-ray spectral fits to regions in the southern rim is $0.95\\pm0.17$ keV,\nconsistent with the electron temperature implied by the shock velocity after\naccounting for Coulomb equilibration and adiabatic expansion. In contrast, the\nemission-measure-weighted average temperature for the northeast region is\n$0.77\\pm0.04$ keV, which is significantly lower than the value inferred from\nthe shock velocity. We fit 1-D evolutionary models for the shock in the\nsouthern rim and northeast region, using the measured radius and propagation\nvelocity into a constant density and power-law profile circumstellar medium.

We employ\ngraph neural networks (GNNs) to estimate galaxy cluster masses from radially\nsampled profiles of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) inferred from X-ray\nobservations. GNNs naturally handle inputs of variable length and resolution by\nrepresenting each ICM profile as a graph, enabling accurate and flexible\nmodeling across diverse observational conditions. We trained and tested GNN\nmodel using state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters from\nThe Three Hundred Project. The mass estimates using our method exhibit no\nsystematic bias compared to the true cluster masses in the simulations.\nAdditionally, we achieve a scatter in recovered mass versus true mass of about\n6\\%, which is a factor of six smaller than obtained from a standard hydrostatic\nequilibrium approach. Our algorithm is robust to both data quality and cluster\nmorphology and it is capable of incorporating model uncertainties alongside\nobservational uncertainties. Finally, we apply our technique to XMM-Newton\nobserved galaxy cluster samples and compare the GNN derived mass estimates with\nthose obtained with $Y_{\\rm SZ}$-M$_{500}$ scaling relations. Our results\nprovide strong evidence, at 5$\\sigma$ level, for a mass-dependent bias in SZ\nderived masses, with higher mass clusters exhibiting a greater degree of\ndeviation. Furthermore, we find the median bias to be $(1-b)=0.85_{-14}^{+34}$,\nalbeit with significant dispersion due to its mass dependence. This work takes\na significant step towards establishing unbiased observable mass scaling\nrelations by integrating X-ray, SZ and optical datasets using deep learning\ntechniques, thereby enhancing the role of galaxy clusters in precision\ncosmology."}

For the first time, we calculate the event\nrates of repeating FRBs detected by diverse telescopes at frequencies\nhigher/lower than 1 GHz in this work. Luminosity and redshift are found to be\npositively correlated with a power law form for both high- and low-frequency\nFRBs, showing an obvious evolution of luminosity with redshift.

Concurrently, evidence for a nHz stochastic\ngravitational wave background observed by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) could\nsuggest a non-astrophysical origin, potentially arising from scalar-induced\ngravitational waves (SIGW). In this work, we analyze the connection between the\ntwo phenomena in the case where they share a common origin: the collapse of\nlarge primordial curvature perturbations in the early universe. We focus on\nsub-solar PBH populations within reach of upcoming experiments, including the\ncurrent and future runs of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA as well as the third generation\nobservatories such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. Using a\nBayesian framework with physically motivated priors, we perform a consistent\nmodel comparison that incorporates existing astrophysical bounds together with\nthe discovery potential of future detectors. Our analysis lends stronger\nsupport for the SIGW interpretation over the astrophysical one, as the narrowed\npriors place greater weight on the region of highest likelihood.

Observing at that frequency it is possible to obtain information on\nthe electrons spectrum at energies where the effect of turbulent reacceleration\nbecomes sub-dominant with respect to energy losses, and therefore to obtain\ninformation on the properties of seed electrons. Under the assumption that dark\nmatter particles are neutralino-like particles annihilating at a rate close to\nthe maximum allowed by Fermi-LAT upper limits in dwarf galaxies, we obtain some\nconstraints on the intensity of the reacceleration and on the value of the\nneutralino mass. In particular, models with mass of the order of 10 GeV are\ngenerally disfavored, because they produce a high-frequency radio spectrum that\ncan not reproduce the possible flattening observed between 5 and 6.6 GHz; on\nthe other hand, models with mass of the order of 500 GeV, in order to reproduce\nthe observed spectrum at frequencies below 100 MHz, require a reacceleration\nphase longer than $10^9$ yr, which would require more than one event\nresponsible of the generation of turbulence in the cluster.

We demonstrate how gravitational microlensing by stellar mass\nobjects along the line of sight to the Galactic Bulge can distinguish between\nthe possibility of extensive emission due to dark matter self-annihilation from\nmore prosaic astrophysical sources, namely millisecond pulsars. Such an\nastrophysical origin would result in emission from a population of small,\ncurrently unresolved point-like sources - in contrast to the expected smoother\nemission resulting from dark matter annihilation. Given that the scale of\ngravitational microlensing, that is, the Einstein radius for stellar mass\nlenses, and hence, the degree of induced magnification, is sensitive to the\nsize of the emitting region, such microlensing will induce time variability in\nthe emission of astrophysical sources, whereas $\\gamma$-ray emission from dark\nmatter annihilation will effectively be immune to such influences. However, we\nfind that detecting microlensing-induced variability requires significantly\ngreater sensitivity than that of current or planned $\\gamma$-ray detectors. For\na small population of bright GCE sources, more than an order-of-magnitude\nincrease in effective area over Fermi-LAT would be required, with events\nremaining extremely rare. For a large population of faint sources, events would\noccur multiple times a year, but would only be detectable with a\nfour-order-of-magnitude improvement. Whilst microlensing might not be a\ndefinitive test of the origin of the GCE, in future observations, it may prove\nuseful in determining the properties of any point-like source population."}

Published by Astrophysics and Space Science", "summary": "The eight ultra-long period pulsars (ULPPs) in radio bands have been\ndiscovered recently, e.g., ASKAP J1935+2148 with a spin period of 53.8\\,min,\nwhich are much longer than those of normal pulsars, spanning from 0.016\\,s to\n23.5\\,s, however the origins, spin evolutions and emission mechanisms of these\nsources are still puzzling. We investigate how the ultra-long period of ASKAP\nJ1935+2148 is evolved by the braking of relativistic particle wind, in a time\nscale of about 0.1 - 1 Myr, from a normal pulsar with local superstrong\nmagnetic fields. In addition, it is noticed that the ULPPs in the period versus\nperiod derivative diagram are much below the ``death line\", implying their\ndifferent characteristics from the normal pulsars. Five sources (including\nASKAP J1935+2148) in total eight ULPPs share the rotational energy loss rates\nto be lower than their respective radio emission luminosities, a phenomenon\nthat can be accounted for by the sustainable radio bursts induced through the\nreconnection of locally concentrated magnetic field lines.The diversity and\ncomplexity of ULPP radio emissions should be closely related to the presence of\nmagnetic reconnection rather than rotational powered discharges in the gaps.\nFurthermore, it is suggested that the coherent radio emissions of pulsars may\nhave two origins, one from the rotation-powered electric voltage that accounts\nfor the normal pulsar phenomena and the other from the magnetic\nreconnection-induced continual radio bursts that account for the ULPP\nobservations."}

Here we present a\nsystematic sample of Swift-monitored AGN. In this analysis, we confirm the\naccretion disk size problem, but find that the lag excess occurs only in the\nsubset of obscured AGN, which show a significantly elevated mean normalization\nof $5.21 \\pm 0.47$ ($p = 0.008$), whereas the unobscured AGN exhibit a mean\nexcess consistent with standard disk predictions ($1.00 \\pm 0.31$). Correlation\nand regression analyses similarly reveal X-ray column density as the strongest\npredictor of lag excess, explaining over 80% of its variance. We interpret\nthese results as line-of-sight obscuration being linked to the too-long lags\nvia additional reprocessed emission from the absorbing material itself. The\nconsistency of lags in the unobscured subgroup with standard disk predictions\nsuggests that the accretion disk size problem is not the result of shortcomings\nof standard accretion disk theory nor contamination by the broad-line region\n(BLR). X-ray to UV lag amplitudes and correlations show more complex and\nvariable behavior in obscured AGN, suggesting that obscuration may disrupt or\ncomplicate the connection between high- and low-energy emission potentially\nthrough reprocessing, scattering, and/or ionization changes."}

The UV lightcurve shows a clear increase over $\\sim 50$ days between years\n1 and 2, strongly coherent with the X-ray lightcurve rise. This changes the\naverage spectral energy distribution such that the disc component is stronger\nwhile the X-ray spectrum steepens, so that the total X-ray power remains\nroughly constant. Outside of this global change, we apply a Fourier resolved\nanalysis to test stochastic models where intrinsic fluctuations in the UV disc\npropagate down into the hard X-ray emission region via both changing the seed\nphoton flux for Compton scattering (short light travel timescale) and changing\nthe electron density (longer propagation timescale). Unlike these models, the\nhard X-rays are not particularly well correlated with the UV, and also have the\nwrong sign in that the hard X-rays marginally lead the UV fluctuations. We show\nthat this is instead consistent with uncorrelated stochastic fluctuations in\nboth the UV (slow) and X-ray (fast), which are linked together only weakly via\nlight travel time.

In this work, we present two approaches to reconstruct and\nconstrain the galaxy formation time $t_f(z)$ using non-parametric\nreconstruction methods, such as Gaussian Processes (GP) and High-performance\nSymbolic Regression (SR). Our analysis uses age estimates of 32 old passive\ngalaxies and the Pantheon+ type Ia supernova sample, and considers two\ndifferent values of the Hubble constant $H_0$ from the SH0ES and Planck\nCollaborations. When adopting the $\\Lambda$CDM model and the GP\nreconstructions, we find $\\left<t_f\\right>=0.72_{-0.16}^{+0.14}$ Gyr (SH0ES)\nand $\\left<t_f\\right>=1.26_{-0.11}^{+0.10}$ Gyr (Planck). Without considering a\nspecific cosmological model, we obtain $\\left<t_f\\right>=0.71 \\pm {0.19}$ Gyr\n(SH0ES) and $\\left<t_f\\right> = 1.35_{-0.23}^{+0.21}$ Gyr (Planck). Similar\nvalues are obtained from the SR reconstructions, with both methods (GP and SR)\nindicating the same behavior regarding the time evolution of $t_f(z)$. The\nresults also show significant differences in the formation time from SH0ES and\nPlanck values, highlighting the impact of the $H_0$ tension on the cosmological\nestimates of $t_f(z)$. In particular, the different approaches used in the\nanalysis agree with each other, demonstrating the robustness and consistency of\nour results. Overall, this study suggests that galaxies have different\nevolutionary timescales and that $t_f$ is not constant, with noticeable\nvariations at lower redshifts ($z \\lesssim 0.5$)."}

Gamma-ray\ndetectors such as LHAASO and VERITAS have detected TeV emission in the vicinity\nof the pulsar. However, the derived SEDs from LHAASO WCDA and VERITAS show\nsignificant discrepancies, which could be due to a complicated energy-dependent\nmorphology not accounted for in the spectral analysis, and different angular\nresolution of the two experiments. CTA~1 has been a target for dedicated\nobservations by the SST-1M telescopes, a pair of small-sized Imaging\nAtmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) capable of operating in both mono and\nstereo modes.

We also\nfind tentative PD variability in the 2--3 keV band.

We recently developed a model-independent\nEccentricity Evolution Consistency Test (EECT, S. A.

To obtain a full picture in gamma-ray band, we\nimplement a comprehensive targeted search of burst emission in a wide window of\n30 days jointly with Insight-HXMT, GECAM and Fermi/GBM data within the ETJASMIN\nframework. In gamma-ray band, we find there is a 50-second precursor about 25\nhours before the 4-hour main burst, which generally consists of 4 emission\nepisodes. Remarkably, we find that the soft X-ray emission (after the main\nburst) decays as a power-law with start time aligning with the last episode of\nmain emission and index of -5/3 perfectly consistent with the canonical\nprediction of fallback accretion. We conclude that the properties of precursor,\nmain burst and the following soft X-ray emission strongly support the atypical\ncollapsar Ultra-Long Gamma-Ray Burst (ULGRB) scenario rather than the Tidal\nDisruption Event (TDE), and all these gamma-ray and soft X-ray emission\nprobably originate from relativistic jet whose luminosity is dominated by the\nfallback accretion rate during the death collapse of a supergiant star."}

The precise spatial and spectral measurements of diffuse\nGalactic gamma-ray emission provide new avenues for unraveling this mystery.\nBased on 16 years of Fermi-LAT observations, we find that the diffuse gamma-ray\nspectral shapes are nearly identical for low energies (below a few GeV) but\nshow significant dispersion at high energies (above a few GeV) across the\nGalactic disk. We further show that the diffuse emission can be decomposed into\ntwo components, a universal spectral component dominating at low energies which\nis consistent with the expectation from interactions of background cosmic rays\nand the interstellar matter, and a spatially variant component dominating at\nhigh energies which is likely due to local accelerators. These findings suggest\nthat there is dual-origin of the Galactic diffuse emission, including the\n``cosmic ray sea'' from efficient propagation of particles and the ``cosmic ray\nislands'' from inefficient propagation of particles, and thus shed new light on\nthe understanding of the propagation models of Galactic cosmic rays."}

The stacked X-ray surface brightness profile reveals a\nstatistically significant signal extending out to 2r200m (~4.5 Mpc).

By integrating the gas density profile out to\nr200m, we infer a gas fraction of 90% of the universal baryon fraction with the\nassumption of a typical halo concentration, indicating the completeness of the\nbaryon budget within large radii. Additionally, we examine the hot gas\ndistribution in massive clusters in the IllustrisTNG simulations from the halo\ncenter to the accretion region. This analysis reveals differences in radial gas\nprofiles depending on whether the direction probes voids or nearby cosmic\nfilaments. Beyond r200m, the density profile along the filament direction\nexceeds that along the void direction. This pattern aligns with the observed\ntransition radius between the one-halo and two-halo terms, suggesting that\nr200m is the approximate radius marking the location at which cosmic filaments\nconnect to galaxy clusters.

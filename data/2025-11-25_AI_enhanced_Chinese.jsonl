However, when one wishes to be precise and quantify the amount of turbulence in a supernova simulation, one immediately encounters the problem that turbulence is difficult to define and measure. Using the 3D magnetohydrodynamic code ELEPHANT, we study how different definitions of turbulence change one's conclusions about the amount of turbulence in a supernova and the extent to which it helps the explosion. We find that, while all the definitions of turbulence we use lead to a qualitatively similar growth pattern over time of the turbulent kinetic energy in the gain region, the total amount of turbulent kinetic energy, and especially the ratios of turbulent to total kinetic energy, distinguish them. Some of the definitions appear to indicate turbulence is a necessary contributor to the explosion, and others indicate it is not. The different definitions also produce turbulence maps with different correlations with maps of the enstrophy, a quantity widely regarded as also indicating the presence of turbulence. We also compute the turbulent adiabatic index and observe that in regions of low enstrophy, this quantity is sensitive to the definition used. As a consequence, the effective adiabatic index depends upon the method used to measure the turbulence and thus alter one's conclusions regarding the impact of turbulence within the supernova.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc73D\u78c1\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4ee3\u7801ELEPHANT\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u6e4d\u6d41\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u6e4d\u6d41\u80fd\u91cf\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u7206\u70b8\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6838\u5fc3\u574d\u7f29\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u6e4d\u6d41\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7206\u70b8\uff0c\u4f46\u6e4d\u6d41\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u6e4d\u6d41\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75283D\u78c1\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4ee3\u7801ELEPHANT\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6e4d\u6d41\u5b9a\u4e49\u5728\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6e4d\u6d41\u52a8\u80fd\u3001\u6e4d\u6d41\u4e0e\u603b\u52a8\u80fd\u6bd4\u7387\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u6e4d\u6d41\u5b9a\u4e49\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u6e4d\u6d41\u80fd\u91cf\u603b\u91cf\u548c\u6e4d\u6d41\u5bf9\u7206\u70b8\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u6e4d\u6d41\u7edd\u70ed\u6307\u6570\u5728\u4f4e\u6da1\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\u5bf9\u5b9a\u4e49\u65b9\u6cd5\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6e4d\u6d41\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u4e2d\u6e4d\u6d41\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8c28\u614e\u9009\u62e9\u6e4d\u6d41\u5b9a\u4e49\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u9760\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002"}}

Submitted to ApJ", "summary": "Accurate and precise measurements of neutron star radii provide invaluable information about the cold, dense matter in neutron star cores. Analyses of synthetic X-ray pulse waveform data similar to the data obtained from non-accreting neutron stars using the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) have indicated that mass and radius estimates made using such data are robust against some systematic errors that may be made when modeling these data, such as errors in the assumed pattern of the thermal X-ray emission from the surface of these stars. A potentially important but so far unexplored source of systematic error is misparameterization of unmodulated background components, which can bias the inferred radius, particularly when data from different telescopes are used in the analysis. In this study, we investigate the effects of the background model on radius estimates by jointly analyzing synthetic NICER and XMM-Newton data, using the $\\sim 2.1~M_\\odot$ pulsar PSR~J0740$+$6620 as a prototypical example. Our analysis shows that even if the background assumed in the model underestimates the actual background by a factor of more than five, the resulting shift of the radius posterior from the true value of the radius corresponds to only $\\sim1\u03c3$. In all the cases we examined, the Bayesian evidence for the correct background model is greater than for the incorrect background model. These results add to the evidence that analyses of NICER-like data provide accurate measurements of neutron star radii when the statistical sampling is thorough and the model fits the data well.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u80cc\u666f\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u534a\u5f84\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u80cc\u666f\u88ab\u4f4e\u4f30\u8d85\u8fc75\u500d\uff0c\u534a\u5f84\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u504f\u79fb\u4e5f\u4ec5\u4e3a\u7ea61\u03c3\uff0c\u8868\u660eNICER\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u534a\u5f84\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u534a\u5f84\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bef\u5dee\u6e90\u2014\u2014\u80cc\u666f\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u534a\u5f84\u63a8\u65ad\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5206\u6790\u5408\u6210\u7684NICER\u548cXMM-Newton\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5PSR J0740+6620\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u4e3a\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u80cc\u666f\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u534a\u5f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u6a21\u578b\u4f4e\u4f30\u5b9e\u9645\u80cc\u666f\u8d85\u8fc75\u500d\uff0c\u534a\u5f84\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e\u503c\u7684\u504f\u79fb\u4e5f\u4ec5\u4e3a\u7ea61\u03c3\uff1b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u80cc\u666f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bc1\u636e\u90fd\u5927\u4e8e\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u7edf\u8ba1\u91c7\u6837\u5145\u5206\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u62df\u5408\u826f\u597d\u65f6\uff0cNICER\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u534a\u5f84\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

The most likely particle accelerator is pulsar J1740+1000 which if offset by 13' north of the UHE source but appears to be connected to it by an extended feature seen in X-rays. For a plausible pulsar distance of 1.2 kpc, 1LHAASO J1740+0948u must be located about 5 pc away which requires rapid transport of electrons along the feature to avoid radiative losses. This poses several challenges for standard pulsar theory. Firstly, being produced $\\lesssim$ 10 kyrs ago, particles must have been accelerated to the energy corresponding to a large fraction of the pulsar's full potential drop across the polar cap. Secondly, due to the lack of TeV emission extension toward the pulsar, particles must be accumulating in the UHE region.

However, such indications may instead arise from the intrinsic likelihood geometry of individual datasets, residual inter-probe tension, or restrictive priors. These factors can mimic evidence for dynamical dark energy. To clarify these issues, we perform a controlled null test. We use realistic mock BAO, CMB, and Type~Ia supernova datasets generated from a common fiducial LambdaCDM cosmology. These mocks include the DESI~DR2 BAO covariance, the Planck~2018 distance-prior covariance, and the full Pantheon+ SH0ES supernova covariance. This setup isolates physical information from geometric or statistical effects in the CPL parametrization. We find that individual probes and most two-probe combinations show apparent deviations in the (w0,wa) plane. These could be mistaken for phantom crossing or evolving dark energy. Two-probe combinations including supernovae (BAO+SNe, CMB+SNe) recover values near (w0,wa)=(-1,0) but fail to reconstruct (Omegam0,H0), because SNe do not determine the absolute distance scale. Combinations without SNe (BAO+CMB), as well as any single dataset, retain strong degeneracy directions. These produce significant shifts driven purely by likelihood geometry. These behaviors arise because BAO, CMB, and SNe each constrain only one principal direction in (w0,wa) space. Their degeneracy ridges are misaligned due to distinct redshift sensitivities.

It is highly plausible though, should they exist, that they would not make up all of the DM. Several studies showed that if the rest of DM is made of thermal particles, then these should accumulate around such PBHs, leading to the formation of very dense spikes in the radiation era. We contributed a detailed analytical study about this phenomenon, providing clear explanations as for the origin of scaling relations in the form of power-law density profiles with up to 3 different spectral indices, i.e. $3/4$, $3/2$, and $9/4$, and 4 asymptotic regimes. Here, we further derive an approximate analytical solution that enables fast numerical predictions for the density profiles of these spikes. We also address the specific case of self-annihilating DM species and derive new approximate analytical formulae. Our approximate density yields the correct annihilation rate within $\\pm 15\\%$ precision. We then focus on indirect detection in the cosmic microwave background and in extragalactic gamma-rays. We shed new and subtle light on how mutually exclusive PBHs and self-annihilating DM species can really be. In particular, the discovery of a population of sub-solar PBHs would set stringent constraints on the $s$-wave annihilation cross-section of these particles, a point so far missed in the literature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u539f\u59cb\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6655\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u6570\u503c\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u81ea\u6e6e\u706d\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5fae\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u4e2d\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u63a2\u6d4b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u539f\u59cb\u9ed1\u6d1e\u662f\u5f88\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5019\u9009\u8005\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u53ea\u6784\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u3002\u5982\u679c\u5176\u4f59\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u7531\u70ed\u7c92\u5b50\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7c92\u5b50\u4f1a\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u79ef\u7d2f\u5f62\u6210\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5c16\u5cf0\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u63a2\u6d4b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u8fd1\u4f3c\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u6765\u5feb\u901f\u9884\u6d4b\u5c16\u5cf0\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u6e6e\u706d\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u7269\u79cd\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u89e3\u6790\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u00b115%\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5185\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u6e6e\u706d\u7387\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e9a\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\u539f\u59cb\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u5c06\u5bf9s\u6ce2\u6e6e\u706d\u622a\u9762\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e25\u683c\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u539f\u59cb\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e0e\u81ea\u6e6e\u706d\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u7269\u79cd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u4e92\u6392\u65a5\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e9a\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\u539f\u59cb\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u5c06\u5bf9\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6e6e\u706d\u622a\u9762\u4ea7\u751f\u91cd\u8981\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u8fc4\u4eca\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u3002"}}

This approach provides a physical motivation to parametrise the non-universality of the HMF in terms of the recent history of structure formation and the local shape of the linear matter power spectrum. Our model was calibrated against measurements from N-body simulations, with halo samples defined by ten overdensity thresholds, $\u0394$, ranging from 150 to 1600 times the mean background matter density. For our reference mass definition, $\u0394=200$, the calibrated fitting function achieves per cent-level accuracy across a wide range of masses, redshifts, and structure formation histories, and maintains this performance when tested on cosmologies with different linear power spectrum shapes. This high level of accuracy is maintained across other mass definitions, degrading only slightly to the 5 per cent level at the highest values of $\u0394$. We also provide fitting formulae to interpolate the parameters as a function of $\u0394$, which allows for accurate modelling of HMFs defined by intermediate overdensities, with accuracy still well within 5 per cent when tested on halo catalogues defined by the virial overdensity threshold. Compared to other commonly used recipes, our prescription yields competitive or superior accuracy across all redshifts and cosmologies, successfully capturing the non-universal features of the HMF where other models exhibit systematic deviations.

Comments welcome", "summary": "The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has identified several individual neutrino emitters associated with supermassive black hole accretion phenomena, including blazars, tidal disruption events, and, unexpectedly, Seyfert galaxies. A key open question is which types of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are most likely to be neutrino emitters. Here we show that high-confidence extragalactic neutrino emitters tend not only to have higher hard X-ray fluxes but also to be more variable in mid-infrared (MIR) than other AGNs in the \\textit{Swift} BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey. MIR variations effectively trace long-term fluctuations in AGN accretion disks and/or jets. In addition to the role of X-ray flux emphasized in previous studies, we speculate that long-term central engine fluctuations may also be critical for neutrino production. This hypothesis may inform IceCube neutrino-electromagnetic counterpart association studies and provide new insights into cosmic ray acceleration sites. First, the observed neutrinos are unlikely to originate from AGN host galaxies or from interactions between large-scale (dozens of parsecs) winds/outflows and the surrounding interstellar medium. Second, if neutrinos are produced in the X-ray corona, the corona should exhibit strong magnetic turbulence dissipation or magnetic reconnection whose rate changes substantially on timescales of years. Third, the relativistic jets of blazar neutrino emitters may be intrinsically unstable over years.

Traditionally, these environments are categorized into four fixed classifications: knots, filaments, walls, and voids, which collectively describe the complex organization of galaxies within large-scale structures. We propose an alternative description that complements the traditional quadripartite categorization by introducing a continuous framework, allowing for a more nuanced examination of the relationship between the intrinsic properties of galaxies and their environments. This complementary description is applied using one of the most prevalent methodologies: categorization using the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix extracted from the matter density field. We integrated our findings into a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation, combined with cosmological numerical simulations, to analyze how the intrinsic properties of galaxies are influenced by environmental changes. In our study, we find a continuous distribution of eigenvalue ratios, revealing a clear dependence of galaxy properties on their surrounding environments. This method allowed us to identify critical values at which transitions in the behavior of key astrophysical galaxy properties become evident.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8fde\u7eed\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8865\u5145\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u56db\u5206\u7c7b\u73af\u5883\u63cf\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Hessian\u77e9\u9635\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u5206\u6790\u661f\u7cfb\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u661f\u7cfb\u6027\u8d28\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u661f\u7cfb\u73af\u5883\u56fa\u5b9a\u5206\u4e3a\u56db\u7c7b\uff08\u8282\u70b9\u3001\u7ea4\u7ef4\u3001\u58c1\u3001\u7a7a\u6d1e\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u7c7b\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u73af\u5883\u5bf9\u661f\u7cfb\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Hessian\u77e9\u9635\u4ece\u7269\u8d28\u5bc6\u5ea6\u573a\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\u503c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u534a\u89e3\u6790\u661f\u7cfb\u5f62\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u661f\u7cfb\u5185\u5728\u6027\u8d28\u968f\u73af\u5883\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u6bd4\u503c\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u661f\u7cfb\u6027\u8d28\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u8f6c\u53d8\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fde\u7eed\u73af\u5883\u63cf\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u5730\u63ed\u793a\u661f\u7cfb\u6027\u8d28\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4f20\u7edf\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u7c7b\u53ef\u80fd\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8f6c\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

However, the observed FRB population is shaped by complex selection effects arising from instrument sensitivity, DM-dependent search efficiency, and FRB source population redshift-evolution. In this work, we quantify the impact of such observational and population selection effects on cosmological inference derived from the conditional distribution $p(\\mathrm{DM}_{\\mathrm{exgal}}|z)$. Using forward-modeled FRB population simulations, we explore progressively realistic survey scenarios incorporating redshift evolution, luminosity function, and instrument DM selection function. To enable rapid likelihood evaluations, we build a neural-network emulator for the variance in cosmic DM, $\u03c3^2[\\mathrm{DM}_{\\mathrm{cosmic}}(z)]$, trained on $5\\times10^4$ baryonification halo-model simulations, achieving $\\leq4\\%$ accuracy up to $z=4$. We demonstrate that while redshift and DM-dependent selection effects substantially alter the joint distribution $p(\\mathrm{DM},z)$, they have a negligible impact on the conditional distribution $p(\\mathrm{DM}_{\\mathrm{exgal}}|z)$ for current sample sizes. The parameter biases are $\\lesssim0.8\u03c3$ for $10^2$ FRBs, indicating that conditional analyses are robust for present surveys. However, depending on the survey DM-dependent search efficiency, these biases may exceed $3\u03c3$ for $10^4$ FRBs, thus implying that explicit modeling of selection effects will be essential for next-generation samples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u79cd\u7fa4\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9FRB\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u4e0b\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\u5206\u6790\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u6765\u66f4\u5927\u6837\u672c\u9700\u8981\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u5feb\u901f\u5c04\u7535\u66b4(FRB)\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u63a2\u6d4b\u5b87\u5b99\u91cd\u5b50\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u89c2\u6d4b\u7fa4\u4f53\u53d7\u5230\u4eea\u5668\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3001\u8272\u6563\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u548cFRB\u6e90\u79cd\u7fa4\u7ea2\u79fb\u6f14\u5316\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u5411\u5efa\u6a21\u7684FRB\u7fa4\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ea2\u79fb\u6f14\u5316\u3001\u5149\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u4eea\u5668DM\u9009\u62e9\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5b87\u5b99DM\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u57285\u00d710^4\u4e2a\u91cd\u5b50\u5316\u6655\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230z=4\u65f6\u22644%\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u7ea2\u79fb\u548cDM\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u5e94\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03p(DM,z)\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03p(DMexgal|z)\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u4e0b\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e10^2\u4e2aFRB\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u504f\u5dee\u22720.8\u03c3\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u8c03\u67e5\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u5f53\u524dFRB\u8c03\u67e5\u662f\u7a33\u5065\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e10^4\u4e2aFRB\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u5e94\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d85\u8fc73\u03c3\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u5e94\u3002"}}

In this study, we investigate the multiwavelength variability of the blazar TON 599, a Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ), with a particular emphasis on its emission line behavior. We focus on the Mg II $\u03bb$2798 \u00c5 emission line, a key tracer of the ionized gas in the broad-line region (BLR), and its role in jet-induced variability. In addition to optical emission lines, we analyze gamma-rays (0.1-300 GeV), X-rays (0.2-10 keV), optical continuum ($\u03bb$3000 \u00c5), optical polarization, and millimeter-wavelength light curves. Three cross-correlation methods are employed to investigate temporal relationships between the emission line and continuum across various wavelengths. Using the Non-Thermal Dominance (NTD) parameter, our analysis confirms that synchrotron emission dominates the continuum during active states, highlighting the jet's primary role in the observed variability. The Mg II emission line exhibits quasi-simultaneous variability with the optical continuum, suggesting photoionization driven by the jet's non-thermal radiation. Additionally, the minimal time lag between gamma-ray and optical/near-ultraviolet emissions supports a synchrotron self-Compton origin for the most variable component of the gamma-ray emission. These findings highlight the importance of emission line variability and multiwavelength observations in constraining the interaction between jets and the BLR in blazars. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of AGN emission mechanisms and the complex interplay between jets and their surrounding environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8000\u53d8\u4f53TON 599\u7684\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8Mg II\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5149\u5b66\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\u7684\u51c6\u540c\u65f6\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u55b7\u6d41\u975e\u70ed\u8f90\u5c04\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5149\u7535\u79bb\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u81ea\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u8d77\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u8000\u53d8\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u55b7\u6d41\u548c\u53d1\u5c04\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u72ec\u7279\u673a\u4f1a\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u89c2\u6d4b\u63a2\u7d22\u55b7\u6d41\u4e0e\u5bbd\u7ebf\u533a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u3001X\u5c04\u7ebf\u3001\u5149\u5b66\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u3001\u5149\u5b66\u504f\u632f\u548c\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8Mg II \u03bb2798 \u00c5\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u4e92\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u70ed\u4e3b\u5bfc\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u6790\u4e3b\u5bfc\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0Mg II\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\u4e0e\u5149\u5b66\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u5448\u73b0\u51c6\u540c\u65f6\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u55b7\u6d41\u975e\u70ed\u8f90\u5c04\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5149\u7535\u79bb\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u4e0e\u5149\u5b66/\u8fd1\u7d2b\u5916\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u652f\u6301\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u6700\u53ef\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u81ea\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u8d77\u6e90\uff1b\u6d3b\u8dc3\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u540c\u6b65\u8f90\u5c04\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u89c2\u6d4b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u8000\u53d8\u4f53\u4e2d\u55b7\u6d41\u4e0e\u5bbd\u7ebf\u533a\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u53ca\u55b7\u6d41\u4e0e\u5176\u5468\u56f4\u73af\u5883\u7684\u590d\u6742\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

This paper critically examines traditional methods for constraining parameters and focuses on the G factor as a tool for evaluating the quality of observational data. To ensure analytical independence, two datasets--Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO)--were utilized as samples for parameter fitting, supplemented by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. The Figure of Merit (FoM) matrix served as the final criterion for assessing fitting performance. The results show that the G factor of the CC dataset increases linearly with redshift z, whereas the G factor of the BAO dataset follows a cubic relationship. Further analysis indicates that the FoM value for datasets with high G factors is significantly higher than that for datasets with low G factors, thereby validating the G factor's effectiveness as a tool for assessing observational data quality and reducing parameter degeneracy.

The ejected debris in these explosions is believed to be the main cosmic source of most elements in the periodic table. However, decoding the spectra of these transients is a challenging task requiring sophisticated spectral synthesis modelling.

When dark matter substructure possesses sufficient perturbations, it may lead to the formation of extra images in otherwise canonical doubly or quadruply imaged systems. With the advent of increasingly precise observational instruments, previously undetectable images may become measurable and image number anomalies therefore could be an increasingly viable method. In this paper, we utilize the gravitational lensing phenomenon of image number anomaly to derive constraints on dark matter substructure. We present the extra images induced by distinct forms of DM substructure, specifically primordial black holes (PBHs) and fuzzy dark matter (FDM) and show that higher angular resolution observations increase the probability of detecting additional lensed images. Based on a null detection of image number anomalies in a sample of 3500 lens systems generated from the \\textit{Strong Lensing Halo model-based mock catalogs} (SL-Hammocks), we derive upper limits on the abundance of PBHs. At the 95\\% confidence level, the PBH abundance is constrained to $\\lesssim 0.125\\%$, $0.08\\%$, and $0.04\\%$ for PBH masses in the range $\\sim 10^{7}$--$10^{9}~M_{\\odot}$, corresponding to angular resolutions of $0.1''$, $0.05''$, and $0.01''$, respectively. Similarly, we exclude particle masses below $0.4$, $0.6$, and $3.5 \\times 10^{-22} \\ \\mathrm{eV}$ for FDM at the same confidence level for the respective resolutions. Furthermore, the abundance of PBHs $\\lesssim 0.9\\%$ could be constrained at an angular resolution of $0.5''$ for the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Observations.

In the case of rapidly spinning black holes, up to $40\\%$ of the rest-mass energy of accreting matter can be released, far exceeding the efficiency of nuclear fusion. In this work, we investigate magnetized particle motion and relativistic accretion processes around a decoupled hairy black hole via extended geometric deformation. The developed geometry involves two hairy parameters that preserve the horizon structure with the additional feature of the fulfillment of weak energy conditions outside the event horizon. We provide the foundation with necessary formalism for magnetized particle motion around a decoupled black hole. The effective potential and innermost stable circular orbits are then derived, which demonstrate a significant reduction of the radius of the latter quantity under the hairy parameters for the magnetized particle. Afterwards, we obtain exact analytical expressions for radial velocity profiles, mass accretion rates, and a few others which reveal improved energy efficiency and emissivity as compared to the standard black hole. Furthermore, the decoupling parameter shows strong influence on oscillations, accretion presenting fantastic agreement between analytical predictions and numerical simulations, and thus offering noticeable observational signatures for future gravitational wave and X-ray astronomy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5e26\u6bdb\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u78c1\u5316\u7c92\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5438\u79ef\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6bdb\u53c2\u6570\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c0f\u6700\u5185\u7a33\u5b9a\u5706\u8f68\u9053\u534a\u5f84\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u80fd\u91cf\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8f90\u5c04\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u548cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u5929\u6587\u89c2\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cd\u8981\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5438\u79ef\u662f\u9ed1\u6d1e\u548c\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u7b49\u81f4\u5bc6\u5929\u4f53\u5c06\u5f15\u529b\u52bf\u80fd\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u6700\u6709\u6548\u673a\u5236\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff0c\u5438\u79ef\u7269\u8d28\u9759\u8d28\u91cf\u80fd\u91cf\u768440%\u53ef\u88ab\u91ca\u653e\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d85\u6838\u805a\u53d8\u6548\u7387\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5f62\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u5e26\u6bdb\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u78c1\u5316\u7c92\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5438\u79ef\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5f62\u5f00\u53d1\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6bdb\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u754c\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u5728\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89c6\u754c\u5916\u6ee1\u8db3\u5f31\u80fd\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u78c1\u5316\u7c92\u5b50\u5728\u89e3\u8026\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u52bf\u548c\u6700\u5185\u7a33\u5b9a\u5706\u8f68\u9053\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u5256\u9762\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u7b49\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u6bdb\u53c2\u6570\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c0f\u4e86\u78c1\u5316\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u6700\u5185\u7a33\u5b9a\u5706\u8f68\u9053\u534a\u5f84\u3002\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u9ed1\u6d1e\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8f90\u5c04\u7387\u5f97\u5230\u6539\u5584\u3002\u89e3\u8026\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u632f\u8361\u548c\u5438\u79ef\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6709\u5f3a\u70c8\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u89e3\u6790\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u8026\u5e26\u6bdb\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u78c1\u5316\u5438\u79ef\u8fc7\u7a0b\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u8f6c\u6362\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u548cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u5929\u6587\u89c2\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6700\u5185\u7a33\u5b9a\u5706\u8f68\u9053\u534a\u5f84\u51cf\u5c0f\u548c\u5438\u79ef\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "We present the results of deep near-infrared imaging of the recently discovered helium star pulsar binary J1928$+$1815 situated in the Galactic plane. Our observations did not achieve significant detections, providing limiting magnitudes of J=23.7 and H=22.2, which are both 2.4\\,magnitudes deeper than the expected J and H magnitudes for a modeled stripped helium star with a mass of 1\\,$\\rm M_{\\odot}$ after extinction. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility of more significant extinction and the exact evolutionary status of the supposed helium star is uncertain, by comparing J1928$+$1815 with other pulsar binaries, we propose a natural alternative solution: that J1928$+$1815 is a heavyweight black widow system with a massive ablated white dwarf. Due to the pulsar's relatively high spin-down power and short orbital separation, the irradiation heating timescale is uniquely shorter than the cooling timescale for the WD companion. As a result, the WD effectively boils, with its outer layers expanding, overfilling the Roche lobe and producing low-density binary-scale haze opaque in the radio band. If this interpretation is correct, J1928$+$1815 would represent a new category distinct from canonical lightweight black widow systems. Radio eclipses can occur in pulsar binaries across a wider range of WD companion masses than previously thought. Therefore, they do not serve as a definitive indicator of a helium star without its direct detection. We contend that a spectroscopic identification remains the smoking gun for its existence. Given the crowding in this field, an \\textit{HST} imaging in the near-infrared band would provide even better constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9J1928+1815\u6c26\u661f\u8109\u51b2\u53cc\u661f\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u89c2\u6d4b\u672a\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5177\u6709\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u5265\u79bb\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u7684\u91cd\u578b\u9ed1\u5be1\u5987\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6c26\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76J1928+1815\u8109\u51b2\u53cc\u661f\u7684\u4f34\u661f\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u662f\u5426\u4e3a\u6c26\u661f\u6216\u5b58\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u6210\u50cf\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97J=23.7\u548cH=22.2\u7684\u6781\u9650\u661f\u7b49\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u89c2\u6d4b\u672a\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u9884\u671f\u7684\u6c26\u661f\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f46\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u81ea\u8f6c\u529f\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\u4e14\u8f68\u9053\u95f4\u8ddd\u77ed\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u4f34\u661f\u5916\u5c42\u81a8\u80c0\u5f62\u6210\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5305\u5c42\u3002", "conclusion": "J1928+1815\u53ef\u80fd\u4ee3\u8868\u4e00\u7c7b\u65b0\u578b\u91cd\u578b\u9ed1\u5be1\u5987\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c04\u7535\u98df\u73b0\u8c61\u4e0d\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6c26\u661f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5149\u8c31\u5b66\u786e\u8ba4\u3002"}}

We update the previous photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) of the KiDS quasars using Hybrid-z, a deep learning framework combining four-band KiDS images and nine-band KiDS+VIKING magnitudes. Hybrid-z is trained on the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR1 and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR17 quasars matching with KiDS, and achieves average bias $\\langle \u03b4z \\rangle < 0.01$ and scatter $\\sim 0.04(1 + z)$ on a test sample. The updated catalog of $\\sim 157k$ quasars over $777~\\mathrm{deg}^2$ is divided into four tomographic bins spanning $0.1 \\leq z_{\\mathrm{phot}} \\leq 2.7$. In each bin, we measure the angular two-point correlation function and compare it with theoretical predictions for dark matter clustering. We estimate the best-fit scale-independent quasar bias, which increases from $b \\approx 1.6$ at $z \\approx 0.6$ to $b \\approx 4.0$ at $z \\approx 2.2$, and is well matched by a quadratic relation in redshift. Our clustering analysis indicates that KiDS quasars reside in dark matter halos of mass $\\log_{10}(M_{\\mathrm{eff}}/h^{-1}M_\\odot)$ in the range $\\sim 12.7$--$12.9$ and effective peak heights $\u03bd_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ rising from $\\sim 1.5$ to $2.9$ over our redshift span. We study two systematics that could affect the bias derivation: stellar contamination and the redshift distribution assumed in the theoretical modeling. The former has a negligible effect, whereas the latter significantly impacts the derived $b(z)$, emphasizing the importance of redshift calibration.

For the first time, we extend coherence and covariance studies into the hard X-ray band up to 150 keV. We detect a clear drop in coherence above 30 keV on both short- and long-timescales relative to the 2-10 keV reference band. To investigate the origin of the coherent variability, we simultaneously fit the short- and long-timescale covariances and the time-averaged spectra with a Comptonization model. Surprisingly, the electron temperature associated with long-timescale variability is significantly higher than that on short timescales. Moreover, the temperature on long timescales remains relatively constant throughout the hard state, whereas the short-timescale temperature evolves with X-ray luminosity. We attribute the drop in coherence to multiple sources of seed photons, i.e., the blackbody and synchrotron photons. The independence between these two photon fields leads to the drop in coherence. To explain the lower electron temperature on short timescales, we propose a two-Comptonization framework in which short-timescale variability arises from a vertically extended central region, while long-timescale variability originates at larger radii. The elevated geometry of the inner region leads to illumination primarily by cooler outer-disk photons, yielding a lower electron temperature. In this case, the evolution of the height of the elevated region could explain the evolution of the electron temperature associated with the coherent variability throughout the hard state.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u548c\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u5230150 keV\u786cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6ce2\u6bb5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0MAXI J1820+070\u9ed1\u6d1eX\u5c04\u7ebf\u53cc\u661f\u5728\u786c\u6001\u671f\u95f4\uff0c30 keV\u4ee5\u4e0a\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u660e\u663e\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u77ed\u65f6\u6807\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u6807\u53d8\u7387\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u6e29\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u5c55\u786cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u548c\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u9ed1\u6d1eX\u5c04\u7ebf\u53cc\u661f\u5728\u786c\u6001\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u7387\u7279\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u540c\u65f6\u62df\u5408\u77ed\u65f6\u6807\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u6807\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u4ee5\u53ca\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u5747\u5149\u8c31\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u5e72\u53d8\u7387\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u957f\u65f6\u6807\u53d8\u7387\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u6e29\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u77ed\u65f6\u6807\uff0c\u4e14\u957f\u65f6\u6807\u6e29\u5ea6\u5728\u786c\u6001\u671f\u95f4\u76f8\u5bf9\u6052\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u77ed\u65f6\u6807\u6e29\u5ea6\u968fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u5ea6\u6f14\u5316\u300230 keV\u4ee5\u4e0a\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u79cd\u5b50\u5149\u5b50\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u91ca\u6e29\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u77ed\u65f6\u6807\u53d8\u7387\u6765\u81ea\u5782\u76f4\u5ef6\u4f38\u7684\u4e2d\u5fc3\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u957f\u65f6\u6807\u53d8\u7387\u6765\u81ea\u8f83\u5927\u534a\u5f84\u533a\u57df\u3002\u5185\u533a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6f14\u5316\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u76f8\u5e72\u53d8\u7387\u7535\u5b50\u6e29\u5ea6\u5728\u786c\u6001\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u3002"}}

We include such a suppression in the form of transfer functions and derive general formulas for the hot-spot core temperature and radius. Applying our results to illustrative scenarios, we find that in the vanilla memory burden scenario in which the evaporation rate and Hawking temperature are exactly constant, the hot-spot temperature is substantially lowered.

The data clearly separate the relativistic broad line from the underlying continuum and from narrow emission and absorption features in the Fe band. The unprecedented spectral resolution in the Fe K band clearly demonstrates that the flux excess can be attributed to a single, broad feature, as opposed to a superposition of previously unresolved narrow features. This broad feature can be best interpreted as emission consistent with an origin near the innermost stable circular orbit around a rapidly rotating black hole. By modeling the shape of the broad line, we find a black hole spin of $a\\simeq0.98$ and an inclination of the inner accretion disk of $\u03b8\\simeq63^\\circ$. The spin is consistent with prior reflection studies, reaffirming the robustness of past spin measurements using the relativistic reflection method. The measured inclination provides reinforcing evidence of a disk-orbit misalignment in Cygnus X-1.

In the presence of anisotropy this universe generally features rotation, in the sense that the principal axes of anisotropic expansion rotate with respect to the cosmic comoving frame. We focus in particular on the minimal case of two superfluids in 2+1 dimensions. The momentum constraint enforces their spatial gradients to be collinear and the dynamics tends to align such a direction with that of maximal expansion at late times. As opposed to the recently studied case of solids, rotation plays a more important role in the present two-superfluids model. The associated energy density does not dilute away but scales as that of anisotropy and affects the total equation of state.

Tight constraints with low significance for the standard non-Gaussian shapes suggest that detection may lie beyond the reach of near-future experiments. However, tests of PNG are highly template-dependent. From a theory perspective, a whole new family of bispectrum shapes arise in the cosmological collider program, with distinct signatures of heavy particles during inflation. In this work, we provide a class of simplified collider templates for these particles that encompasses a broader range of masses, sound speeds, and interactions. We propose that, given the current state of observations, the most effective strategy to search for PNG signals is through orthogonalizing the collider templates, such that they are uncorrelated with the tightly constrained single field predictions. Using the Modal pipeline and Planck CMB data, we perform a systematic parameter scan of the collider templates with the most significant result reaching $2.4\u03c3$ for spin-0, after taking into account the look-elsewhere effect; indicative results for spin-1 and spin-2 peak near 2$\u03c3$. These results indicate that, with refined collider templates and improved data analysis strategies, there are credible prospects with forthcoming observations to detect PNG and also rule out single field inflation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u641c\u7d22\u539f\u59cb\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027(PNG)\u7684\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u5bf9\u649e\u673a\u6a21\u677f\u6765\u907f\u514d\u4e0e\u5355\u573a\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5728Planck CMB\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e862.4\u03c3\u7684\u663e\u8457\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4e25\u683c\u4f46\u663e\u8457\u6027\u4f4e\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u80fd\u8d85\u51fa\u8fd1\u671f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u5bf9\u649e\u673a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53cc\u8c31\u5f62\u72b6\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66b4\u80c0\u671f\u95f4\u91cd\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u5bf9\u649e\u673a\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u58f0\u901f\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u4f7f\u6a21\u677f\u4e0e\u5355\u573a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528Modal pipeline\u548cPlanck CMB\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u626b\u63cf\u3002", "result": "\u81ea\u65cb0\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u6700\u663e\u8457\u7ed3\u679c\u8fbe\u52302.4\u03c3\uff08\u8003\u8651\u591a\u91cd\u68c0\u9a8c\u6548\u5e94\u540e\uff09\uff1b\u81ea\u65cb1\u548c\u81ea\u65cb2\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u63a5\u8fd12\u03c3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5bf9\u649e\u673a\u6a21\u677f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u89c2\u6d4b\u6709\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u524d\u666f\u68c0\u6d4bPNG\u5e76\u6392\u9664\u5355\u573a\u66b4\u80c0\u3002"}}

Observing many black holes over different timescales can enhance our chances of detecting variability coming from (partial) tidal disruption events, massive black hole binaries, changing state AGN, blazar activity and much more. X-ray catalogues with hundreds of thousands of detections are treasure troves of such sources, which require innovative methods to identify these black holes. We present the current XMM-Newton catalogues available and describe several examples of tidal disruption events (TDEs) and quasi-periodic eruption sources that have been found whilst mining this data. We describe preliminary work on a search for periodic variables in the XMM-Newton EPIC archival data, with the example of finding new massive black hole binaries. We also describe the STONKS pipeline that is now in the XMM-Newton automatic reduction pipeline and the near real-time alert system that allows the follow-up of new and fading transients. We provide examples of fading sources that are newly identified candidate TDEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u5229\u7528XMM-Newton X\u5c04\u7ebf\u76ee\u5f55\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u9ed1\u6d1e\u76f8\u5173\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6f6e\u6c50\u74e6\u89e3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3001\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7206\u53d1\u6e90\u548c\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53cc\u661f\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b9e\u65f6\u8b66\u62a5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u6d4b\u5927\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684X\u5c04\u7ebf\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6f6e\u6c50\u74e6\u89e3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3001\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53cc\u661f\u3001\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7b49\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528XMM-Newton EPIC\u6863\u6848\u6570\u636e\u641c\u7d22\u5468\u671f\u6027\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1STONKS\u7ba1\u9053\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u8b66\u62a5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u77ac\u53d8\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u6f6e\u6c50\u74e6\u89e3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u548c\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7206\u53d1\u6e90\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53cc\u661f\u5019\u9009\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u5019\u9009TDEs\u8870\u51cf\u6e90\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "XMM-Newton\u76ee\u5f55\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u76f8\u5173\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5b9d\u8d35\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5404\u79cd\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6d3b\u52a8\u73b0\u8c61\u3002"}}

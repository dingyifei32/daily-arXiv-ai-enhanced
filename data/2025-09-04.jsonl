In gravitational imaging, strong gravitational lens observations are\nused to detect individual objects from this population, if they are large\nenough to perturb the strongly lensed images. We show here that low-mass\nhaloes, below the individually detectable mass limit, have a detectable effect\non the lensed images when in large numbers, which is the case in cold dark\nmatter (CDM). We find that, in CDM, this population causes an excess of 40 per\ncent in the number of detected subhaloes for HST-like strong lens observations.\nWe propose a pseudo-mass function to describe this population, and fit for its\nparameters from the detection data. We find that it mostly consists of objects\ntwo orders of magnitude in mass below the detection limit of individual\nobjects. We show that including this modification, so that the effect of the\npopulation is correctly predicted, can dramatically improve the available\nconstraints on dark matter from strong lens observations. We repeat our\nexperiments using models that contain varying amounts of angular structure in\nthe lens galaxy. We find that these multipole perturbations are strongly\ndegenerate with the population signal, to an even greater extent than with\nindividual subhaloes.

A major challenge in\nthe simulations is in modelling of the outermost layers, known as the envelope,\nexhibiting a drop of many orders of magnitude in temperature and density in a\ngeometrically thin shell. This is often addressed by constructing a separate\nenvelope model in plane-parallel approximation that produces a relation between\nthe temperature at the bottom of the envelope, $T_b$, and the surface\ntemperature, $T_s$. Our aim is to construct a general framework for\napproximating the $T_b$-$T_s$ relation that is able to include the dependencies\nfrom the strength and orientation of the magnetic field. We used standard\nprescriptions to calculate a large number of magnetised envelope models to be\nused as a training sample and employed single-hidden-layer feedforward neural\nnetworks as approximators, providing the flexibility, high accuracy, and fast\nevaluation necessary in neutron star simulations. We explored the optimal\nnetwork architecture and hyperparameter choices and used a special holdout set\ndesigned to avoid overfitting to the structure of the input data.

To do this, we computed the disc\ntransfer function in the case of X-ray reverberation using a recent physical\nmodel and studied its dependence on the parameters of the model. This model\nallows us to explore the variability of X-ray illuminated discs under the\nscenario in which the X-ray corona is powered by the accretion process or by an\nexternal source. We then calculated UV/optical power spectra using the disc\ntransfer function and assuming a bending power law for the X-ray power\nspectrum. We fitted our models to the observed power spectra of quasars\ndetermined by a recent power spectrum analysis of the SDSS Stripe-82 light\ncurves.

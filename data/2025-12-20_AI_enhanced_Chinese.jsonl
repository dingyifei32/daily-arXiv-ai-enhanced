(..) We focused our search on gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), X-ray flashes (XRFs), X-ray flares from high-mass X-ray binaries and stellar flares, while Type-I and II X-ray bursts from Galactic neutron stars were excluded. 149 such fast transient events were detected. 63 of these are new to the literature. 38 flares are identified with 22 nearby stars. Three stars have never been seen flaring before in X-rays or optical (NLTT 51688, GR Dra and UCAC4 255-003783). We find that the MeV transient GRO J1753+57 is most likely the same object as GR Dra rather than an AGN as previously thought. Eleven flares were detected from known high-mass X-ray binaries with irregular wind accretion (four of which are of the subclass of supergiant fast X-ray transients). 100 GRBs were identified of which 24 have not been published before. We classify 37% of the X-ray detected GRBs as XRFs with relatively large X-ray to gamma-ray flux ratio, gamma-rays being measured with the BeppoSAX Gamma Ray Burst Monitor. The duration/spectral hardness distribution of all FXTs is bimodal, separating the group roughly in transients shorter and longer than 1 ksec and with relatively hard and soft spectra, respectively. We identify the 'short' FXTs as GRBs and XRFs and the `long' FXTs as flares from nearby late-type stars and X-ray binaries. The BeppoSAX-WFC FXT sample is found to be consistent with the one observed by Einstein Probe, when the sensitivity of the two instruments is taken into account.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528BeppoSAX\u536b\u661fWFC\u4eea\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff081996-2002\u5e74\uff09\u641c\u7d22\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f41\u79d2\u81f31\u5929\u7684\u5feb\u901fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6682\u73b0\u6e90\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0149\u4e2a\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec100\u4e2a\u4f3d\u9a6c\u66b4\u300138\u4e2a\u6052\u661f\u8000\u6591\u548c11\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfX\u5c04\u7ebf\u53cc\u661f\u8000\u6591\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d63\u4e2a\u662f\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528BeppoSAX\u536b\u661f\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u7cfb\u7edf\u641c\u7d22\u5feb\u901fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6682\u73b0\u6e90\uff0c\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u7684\u4f3d\u9a6c\u66b4\u3001X\u5c04\u7ebf\u95ea\u3001\u6052\u661f\u8000\u6591\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfX\u5c04\u7ebf\u53cc\u661f\u8000\u6591\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u6587\u732e\u7a7a\u767d\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b0\u89c2\u6d4b\u4eea\u5668\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790BeppoSAX\u536b\u661fWFC\u4eea\u56681996\u5e746\u6708\u81f32002\u5e744\u6708\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u641c\u7d22\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f41\u79d2\u81f31\u5929\u7684\u5feb\u901fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6682\u73b0\u6e90\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u7684I\u578b\u548cII\u578bX\u5c04\u7ebf\u66b4\uff0c\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230149\u4e2a\u5feb\u901fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6682\u73b0\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d63\u4e2a\u662f\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u9996\u6b21\u62a5\u9053\u3002\u5305\u62ec\uff1a100\u4e2a\u4f3d\u9a6c\u66b4\uff0824\u4e2a\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\uff09\uff0c38\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea22\u9897\u90bb\u8fd1\u6052\u661f\u7684\u8000\u6591\uff083\u9897\u6052\u661f\u9996\u6b21\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230X\u5c04\u7ebf\u6216\u5149\u5b66\u8000\u6591\uff09\uff0c11\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea\u5df2\u77e5\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfX\u5c04\u7ebf\u53cc\u661f\u7684\u8000\u6591\u300237%\u7684X\u5c04\u7ebf\u63a2\u6d4b\u4f3d\u9a6c\u66b4\u88ab\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3aX\u5c04\u7ebf\u95ea\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5feb\u901fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6682\u73b0\u6e90\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u786c\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u5448\u53cc\u5cf0\u7279\u5f81\uff1a\u77ed\u4e8e1\u5343\u79d2\u7684\u786c\u8c31\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e3b\u8981\u4e3a\u4f3d\u9a6c\u66b4\u548cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u95ea\uff0c\u957f\u4e8e1\u5343\u79d2\u7684\u8f6f\u8c31\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e3b\u8981\u4e3a\u90bb\u8fd1\u665a\u578b\u6052\u661f\u548cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u53cc\u661f\u7684\u8000\u6591\u3002BeppoSAX-WFC\u7684\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

The Maxwell\nequations, supplemented by bi-isotropic constitutive relations, are rewritten\nto describe a cold, uniform, and collisionless plasma model that yields new\ncollective electromagnetic modes for distinct pairs of refractive indices\nassociated with right- and left-handed circularly polarized waves. We have\ninvestigated the optical behavior through the rotatory power (RP) and dichroism\ncoefficient, reporting that the finite chiral parameter induces double RP sign\nreversal, an exotic optical signature that takes place in chiral dielectrics\nand rotating plasmas. In the low-frequency regime, a modified propagating\nhelicon with right-handed circular polarization is obtained. Next, supposing\nthat the interstellar medium behaves as a bi-isotropic cold plasma, we employ\nAstrophysical data of radio pulsars to achieve upper limits on the\nmagnetoelectric parameters magnitude. In particular, by using dispersion\nmeasure and rotation measure data from five pulsars, we constrain the magnitude\nof the chiral parameter to the order of $10^{-16}$ and $10^{-22}$,\nrespectively."}

This challenges standard formation channels such as\nclassical stellar evolution and hierarchical mergers. However, stellar rotation\nand magnetic fields, which have not been systematically incorporated in prior\nmodels, can strongly influence the BH properties. We present the first\nself-consistent simulations tracking a massive, low-metallicity helium star\nfrom helium core burning through collapse, BH formation, and post-BH formation\naccretion using 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD)\nsimulations. Starting from a $250\\,M_\\odot$ helium core, we show that collapse\nabove the pair-instability mass gap, aided by rotation and magnetic fields,\ndrives mass loss through disk winds and jet launching. This enables the\nformation of highly spinning BHs within the mass gap and reveals a BH spin-mass\ncorrelation. Strong magnetic fields extract angular momentum from the BH\nthrough magnetically driven outflows, which in turn suppress accretion,\nresulting in slowly spinning BHs within the mass gap. In contrast, stars with\nweak fields permit nearly complete collapse and spin-up of the BH to $\na\\approx1$. We show that massive low-metallicity stars with moderate magnetic\nfields naturally produce BHs whose masses and spins match those inferred for\nGW231123, and are also consistent with those of GW190521. The outflows may\nimpart a BH kick, which can induce spin-orbit misalignment and widen the\npost-collapse orbit, delaying the merger. The outflows launched during collapse\nmay power short-lived, high-luminosity jets comparable to the most energetic\n$\\gamma$-ray bursts, offering a potential observational signature of such\nevents in the early universe."}

Modern detection algorithms are an efficient way to identify\nfilaments in large-scale observational surveys of galaxies.

The\nCore Array interferometry, with higher sensitivity and angular resolution,\nprovides robust HI galaxy detections up to $z \\sim 1$, maintaining a sufficient\nnumber density for power spectrum measurements and BAO constraints. At low\nredshifts ($z \\sim 0.01$ -- $0.08$), both configurations perform well, though\ncosmic variance dominates uncertainties. At higher redshifts ($z > 0.35$), the\nCore Array outperforms the single-dish mode, while increasing the survey area\nhas little impact on single-dish observations due to shot noise limitations.\nThe DS mode efficiently covers large sky areas but is constrained by Earth's\nrotation, whereas the OTF mode allows more flexible deep-field surveys at the\ncost of operational overhead. Our findings highlight the importance of\noptimizing survey strategies to maximize FAST's potential for HI cosmology. The\nCore Array is particularly well-suited for high-redshift HI galaxy surveys,\nenabling precise constraints on large-scale structure and dark energy."}

When a cosmic ray enters the atmosphere, it\ninitiates an extensive air shower, producing a cascade of secondary particles\nthat propagate toward the ground. Large arrays of surface detectors are used to\nmeasure these secondary particles upon arrival.\n  The signal detected at a specific reference distance from the shower core\nserves as a proxy for the shower size and, consequently, as a reliable\nestimator of the energy of primary cosmic ray. However, shower development is\ninfluenced by attenuation effects: measured signals at the ground depend on the\namount of traversed atmospheric density (column density) through which the\nshower evolves. Since the column density varies with the inclination of the\nshower, it is important to account for these attenuation effects to ensure\naccurate energy estimation.\n  In this study, we derive physics-and-geometry-based functional forms to\ndescribe attenuation and propose appropriate expansion terms using simple\none-dimensional shower-development models, incorporating one or two main\nparticle-cascade components. We then evaluate the applicability and\neffectiveness of these functional forms using a Monte-Carlo dataset that\nincludes various primary cosmic-ray particles. By directly calibrating the the\nshower size derived from ground signals to the Monte-Carlo energy, we\ncharacterize attenuation behavior across different primary particles, assess\nthe energy dependence of attenuation, and quantify systematic uncertainties\nintroduced by different functional forms."}

Several spectral parameters,\nhowever, show clear and systematic modulations with pulse phase, indicating\nvariations in the physical conditions of the emitting plasma over the neutron\nstar's rotation.

Therefore, inferring the neutral fraction over cosmic\ntime is a goal of upcoming 21 cm experiments, such as the Square Kilometer\nArray (SKA). We contrast two approaches to infer astrophysical parameters and\nionization history from 21 cm 2D power spectra (2DPS). We develop an emulator\nof the 21 cm 2DPS, trained on 21cmFAST simulations, taking into account the\nexpected instrumental noise from the SKA and sample variance.

We\ncompare training on datasets of noisy 2DPS obtained from 21cmFAST simulations\nand an emulator, to infer astrophysical parameters of interest. Using an\nemulator of the ionization history, which has been trained on simulations from\nthe same astrophysical parameters, we then obtain posterior distributions of\nthe ionization history over the redshift range z $\\sim$ 5-12. We demonstrate\nthat both methods are capable of accurately recovering the ionization history\nand astrophysical parameters. However, coverage tests indicate that adding\nemulated samples does not improve predictions.

That these are real\nfeatures on the sky is uncontested.

Therefore, we focus in this\npaper on testing the fluke hypothesis, based on the partial correlation between\nthe temperature and $E$-mode CMB polarisation signal. In particular, we compare\nthe properties of specific statistics in polarisation, built from unconstrained\nrealisations of the $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model as might be observed by the\nLiteBIRD satellite, with those determined from constrained simulations, where\nthe part of the $E$-mode anisotropy correlated with temperature is constrained\nby observations of the latter. Specifically, we use inpainted Planck 2018 SMICA\ntemperature data to constrain the $E$-mode realisations. Subsequent analysis\nmakes use of masks defined to minimise the impact of the inpainting procedure\non the $E$-mode map statistics.\n  We find that statistical assessments of the $E$-mode data alone do not\nprovide any evidence for or against the fluke hypothesis.

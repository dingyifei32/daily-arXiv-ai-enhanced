### [1] [Search for binary companions around millisecond pulsars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18669)
*Arpita Choudhary*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究探讨毫秒脉冲星（MSPs）的高自转速度可能源于双星系统中的角动量转移，并试图通过观测和计时确认其孤立或双星性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约35%的MSPs被认为是孤立的，但部分可能实际处于未被探测到的双星系统中，这激发了寻找其潜在伴星的研究。

Method: 通过高精度计时和光学观测，识别银河系中MSPs的可能伴星，并进一步确认其双星性质。

Result: 研究可能发现MSPs的光学辐射或其伴星，并通过计时活动确认双星系统的轨道参数。

Conclusion: 该研究有助于理解MSPs的形成机制及其双星系统的性质，为未来观测提供方向。

Abstract: It is believed that the radio pulsars rotating at spin periods of about 30
millisecond or even lower got such high spins through the transfer of angular
momentum by accreting matter from their binary companions (or past companions)
in the past. Around 35% of MSPs are known to be isolated, some of the which
might actually be in binaries - either not timed very well to obtain the
signature of the orbit or in extremely wide binaries that can be revealed only
through very accurate timing, as in the case of PSR J1024-0719. This has
motivated an exercise to identify probable candidates of companions of MSPs in
the Galactic field. This exercise has even the potential of discovering optical
emission from MSPs themselves. Discovery of any possible binary companion will
be followed by motivated pulsar timing campaigns to confirm the binary nature
and to constrain orbital parameters.

### [2] [Insight-HXMT Spectral and Timing Studies of a Giant Outburst in RX J0440.9+4431](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18676)
*Prahlad R. Epili,Wei Wang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究分析了Be/X射线双星脉冲星RX J0440.9+4431在2022年爆发期间的X射线光谱和时序变化，发现脉冲轮廓随光度变化，并探测到回旋共振散射特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究该脉冲星在爆发期间的光谱和时序变化，以理解其物理机制和磁场特性。

Method: 利用Insight-HXMT观测数据，分析脉冲轮廓和光谱，应用吸收截止幂律模型和康普顿化模型。

Result: 脉冲轮廓随光度变化，探测到回旋共振散射特征（33.6-41.6 keV），并发现高表面磁场（约10^13 G）。

Conclusion: 结果表明脉冲星的磁场强度较高，且光谱和时序变化与光度密切相关。

Abstract: The Be/X-ray binary pulsar RX J0440.9+4431 underwent a giant outburst in late
2022 and lasted three months. The Insight-HXMT has observed this source at
several instances of the entire outburst in 2022-2023. We used these bright
outburst observations of the pulsar to study its X-ray spectral and timing
variability. The pulse profiles obtained at similar luminosity during the
progress and declining phases of the outburst show a similar shape
behavior.With the increase in source luminosity, the complex pulse profile with
multiple peaks at low luminosity becomes a single peaked pulse profile at the
high luminosity at the outburst peak. The phase-averaged spectra of the pulsar
in 1-120 keV are explained with an absorbed cutoff power-law continuum model.
During the outburst phases, we have found the evidence of a cyclotron resonance
scattering feature in the spectra varying in energies ($\sim$ 33.6- 41.6 keV)
having broad linewidth > 5 keV . In declining phases of the outburst, we have
also found the hints of first cyclotron harmonic varying in 65-75 keV . The
application of thermal and bulk Comptonization model to the phase-averaged and
phase-resolved spectra reveals a high surface magnetic field ($B \sim 10^{13}$
G) for the pulsar.

### [3] [Transient MeV radiation from a relativistic tidal disruption candidate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18694)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文分析了2025年7月2日费米伽马射线太空望远镜探测到的三个短时MeV瞬变事件（GRB 250702D、B、E，合称DBE），揭示了其与相对论性TDE（潮汐瓦解事件）相关的特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究DBE事件的独特MeV伽马射线辐射特性，以理解其物理起源及其与相对论性TDE的联系。

Method: 利用费米伽马射线望远镜、Swift天文台和NuSTAR的观测数据，分析MeV和软X射线辐射的时间演化及光谱特性。

Result: DBE的光谱符合单幂律分布（dNγ/dE ∝ E−1.5），能量范围10 keV至40 MeV，且在高能区（>100 MeV）存在谱截断。通过MeV伽马射线透明度论证，推导出喷流洛伦兹因子的下限。

Conclusion: DBE是首个探测到MeV伽马射线辐射的相对论性TDE，其特性与已知的四个相对论性TDE一致，MeV辐射可能源于喷流中电子的同步辐射或逆康普顿冷却。

Abstract: On July 2, 2025, the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) onboard the Fermi
Gamma-ray space telescope detected three short-duration MeV transients with
overlapping sky locations. These events, named as GRB 250702D, B, and E
(collectively referred to as DBE), triggered the detector with delays of
approximately 1-2 hours between each burst. Follow-up observations of this
unusually long MeV transient (lasting >3 hours) by the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory and the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array over a period of 10
days revealed a steep temporal decline in soft X-rays ($\propto t^{-1.9 \pm
0.1}$). These characteristics are consistent with the scenario in which DBE
arises from a relativistic jet launched after the tidal disruption of a star by
a compact object. In the relativistic Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) scenario,
DBE is the first one with detected MeV $\gamma$-ray emission. We show that the
time-resolved MeV spectra during the outbursts are best described by a single
power-law, $dN_{\gamma}/dE \propto E^{-1.5}$, extending from 10 keV to 40 MeV.
The upper limits at higher energies ($>$ 100 MeV) indicate that the spectrum
breaks at $10-100$ MeV. From standard MeV $\gamma$-ray transparency arguments,
we derive a lower limit on the jet bulk Lorentz factor. These constraints place
DBE in the same category as four previously reported relativistic TDEs in terms
of outburst luminosity and energetics. We discuss the origin of the MeV
emission in several scenarios, including synchrotron and inverse Compton
cooling of electrons accelerated in the jet.

### [4] [Magnetic Flux Emergence in Binary Neutron Star Remnants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18695)
*Jacob Fields,David Radice,Peter Hammond*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 高分辨率模拟显示，中子星合并残余物中磁场浮力不稳定性仅对极强磁场（超过10^17 G）有效，而典型磁场（约10^16 G）受流体动力学效应主导，限制了磁驱动喷流的产生机制。


<details>

Motivation: 研究中子星合并残余物中磁结构的浮力不稳定性及其对磁驱动喷流的影响。

Method: 使用高分辨率AthenaK模拟扭曲环形磁通量管，分析磁场在热中子星剪切层中的浮力不稳定性。

Result: 极强磁场（>10^17 G）才能通过浮力不稳定性浮出，而典型磁场（~10^16 G）受流体动力学效应主导。

Conclusion: 中子星合并残余物难以通过典型磁场产生磁驱动喷流，限制了其喷流机制。

Abstract: Using high-resolution AthenaK simulations of a twisted toroidal flux tube, we
study the flux emergence of magnetic structures in the shear layer of a hot
massive neutron star typical of a binary neutron star remnant. High-resolution
simulations demonstrate that magnetic buoyant instabilities allow for emergence
only for extremely large magnetic fields significantly exceeding
$10^{17}~\mathrm{G}$, and more typical fields around $10^{16}~\mathrm{G}$ are
instead dominated by hydrodynamic effects. Because merger remnants tend to be
stable against hydrodynamic convection, our work places strong limitations on
the mechanisms by which massive binary neutron star remnants can produce the
magnetically-driven outflows needed to power jets.

<details>

Motivation: 通过观测GRB余辉的TeV γ射线，研究相对论性冲击波的微观物理和周围介质的分布。

Conclusion: 强调了宽视场望远镜在发现高红移GRB余辉中的重要性，并展示了低能阈值望远镜的潜力。

Abstract: A significant fraction of the energy from the $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) jets,
after powering the keV-MeV emission, forms an ultra-relativistic shock
propagating into the circumburst medium. The particles in the medium accelerate
through the shock and produce afterglow emission. Recently, a few GRB
afterglows have been observed in TeV $\gamma$-rays by Cherenkov Telescopes.
This provides access to broadband spectra of GRB afterglows containing rich
information about the microphysics of relativistic shocks and the profile of
the circumburst medium. Since the transition from synchrotron to inverse
Compton regime in afterglow spectra occurs between hard X-rays and the
very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-rays, detection in one of these bands is
required to identify the two spectral components. The early afterglow data in
the hard X-rays, along with the GeV emission, could accurately constrain the
spectral shape and help in capturing the spectral turnover to distinguish the
two components. We present the multiwavelength spectral and temporal study,
focused on the keV-VHE domain, of GRB 230812B, one of the brightest GRBs
detected by Fermi Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GBM), along with the detection of a
72 GeV photon in Large Area Telescope (LAT) during the early afterglow phase.
Through a detailed modelling of the emission within the afterglow external
forward shock in a wind-like scenario, we predict optical to high-energy
observations up to ~1 day. We emphasize the importance of following up poorly
localised GRBs by demonstrating that even without prompt sub-degree
localisation, such as in GRB 230812B, it is possible to recover the emission
using imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, thanks to their relatively
wider field of view. Moreover, we show that the low energy threshold of
Large-Sized Telescope is essential in discovering the VHE component at much
higher redshifts, typical of long GRBs.

Conclusion: 宇宙射线电子的贡献可能解释了冷核星系团中的观测现象，并提供了新的测试方法。

Abstract: X-ray bright cool-core (CC) clusters contain luminous radio sources
accelerating cosmic ray (CR) leptons at prodigious rates. Near the acceleration
region, high-energy leptons produce synchrotron (mini)halos and sometimes
observable gamma rays, but these leptons have short lifetimes and so cannot
propagate far from sources without some rejuvenation. However, low-energy
(~0.1-1 GeV) CRs should survive for >Gyr, potentially reaching ~100 kpc before
losing energy via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons to keV X-ray
energies, with remarkably thermal X-ray spectra. In groups/clusters, this will
appear similar to relatively 'cool' gas in cluster cores (i.e. CCs). In
lower-mass (e.g. Milky Way/M31) halos, analogous CR IC emission will appear as
hot (super-virial) gas at outer CGM radii, explaining recent diffuse X-ray
observations. We show that for plausible (radio/gamma-ray observed) lepton
injection rates, the CR-IC emission could contribute significantly to the X-ray
surface brightness (SB) in CCs, implying that CC gas densities may have been
overestimated and alleviating the cooling flow problem. A significant IC
contribution to diffuse X-ray emission in CC clusters also explains the tight
correlation between the X-ray 'cooling luminosity' and AGN/cavity/jet power,
because the apparent CC emission is itself driven by the radio source.
Comparing observed Sunyaev Zeldovich to X-ray inferred pressures at $\ll 100$
kpc in CCs represents a clean test of this scenario, and existing data appears
to favor significant CR-IC. A significant IC contribution also implies that
X-ray inferred gas-phase metallicities have been underestimated in CCs,
potentially explaining the discrepancy between X-ray (sub-Solar) and optical/UV
(super-Solar) observed metallicities in the central ~10 kpc of nearby CCs. We
also discuss the model's connection to observations of multiphase gas in
clusters.

### [7] [A New Framework to Detect Multi-Messenger Signals from Bright Sporadic Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18955)

Result: 该方法显著降低了误报率，并提出了适用于当前和未来任务的观测策略。

Conclusion: MC²方法推动了多信使观测的前沿，未来还可应用于中微子等其他信使。

Abstract: The temporal dependence of the astrophysical stochastic gravitational-wave
(GW) background (SGWB) in the hecto-hertz band brings a unique avenue to
identify multi-messenger signals to these sources by using coincident detection
in both GW and multi-band EM signals. We developed a new analysis pipeline,
\textit{Multi-messenger Cross-Correlation} (MC$^2$) that can search for EM
counterparts to the SGWB signal originating from both modeled and unmodeled
sources by harnessing the nearly full-sky gamma-ray sky map. We provide an
observation strategy that can be followed by current and future missions to
discover EM counterparts to the weak GW signal hidden in the SGWB. We
demonstrate the ability of this technique to drastically reduce the false alarm
rates when involving EM multi-band analysis. This formalism aims towards
advancing the multi-messenger observation frontier and improving our
understanding of the population of bright SGWB sources present in the
high-redshift universe and can also be applied to other messengers such as
neutrinos in the future.

Conclusion: JWST+NIRCam成功揭示M87喷流的结构和光谱特性，为喷流物理研究提供新数据。

Abstract: We present the first JWST+NIRCam images of the giant elliptical active galaxy
M87 and its jet at 0.90, 1.50, 2.77 and 3.56 $\mu$m. We analysed the
large-scale jet structure, identifying prominent components, and determined the
near-infrared spectral index. The data were calibrated using the standard JWST
pipeline. We subtracted a constant background level and a smooth model of the
galaxy surface brightness to isolate the jet. The total image fluxes measured
in the NIRCam filters follow the infrared bump pattern seen near 1.6 $\mu$m in
the spectral energy distribution of M87, caused by the surrounding stellar
population in the galaxy. The residual jet images broadly agree with the radio
to optical synchrotron power law $S_\lambda\propto\lambda^\alpha$ with
$\alpha=$0.7-1.0. We identified the most upstream knot L at a distance of
(320$\pm$50) mas from the core. The component HST-1, at (950$\pm$50) mas from
the core, is transversely resolved, and both the individual images and the
spectral index map clearly indicate its double-component substructure with two
elements of similar size and flux density, with centroids separated by
(150$\pm$20) mas and with a significantly larger spectral index $\alpha$
observed in the downstream component ($\alpha_{\rm do}=0.3$) than in the
upstream one ($\alpha_{\rm up}= -0.15$). We also observe the counter-jet
component located about 24 arcsec away from the nucleus.

Conclusion: 改进方法有助于更清晰地揭示宇宙中微子能谱特征。

Abstract: Recently, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory has reported a deviation from the
single power law in the extragalactic diffuse neutrino flux. A neural
network-based event selection of contained and uncontained cascade events from
IceCube, in which uncontained events have interaction vertices at the edge or
outside of the detector instrumentation volume, has a factor \textasciitilde3
gain in effective area over the cascade events used in the novel combined
tracks and cascades selection which reported the deviation. Systematic
improvements and rigorously updated modeling of the atmospheric neutrino
background is incorporated into this high statistics contained and uncontained
cascade event selection to clarify features of the astrophysical neutrino
spectrum across energies from 1 TeV up to 100 PeV.

Abstract: Most long Gamma-ray bursts originate from a rare type of massive stellar
explosion. Their afterglows, while rapidly fading, can be initially extremely
luminous at optical/near-infrared wavelengths, making them detectable at large
cosmological distances. Here we report the detection and observations of GRB

near-infrared afterglow discovery and the spectroscopic measurements of its
redshift z $\simeq$ 7.3 . This burst happened when the Universe was only $\sim$
5% of its current age. We discuss the signature of these rare events within the
context of the SVOM operating model, and the ways to optimize their
identification with adapted ground follow-up observation strategies.

Abstract: The majority of energetic long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are thought
to arise from the collapse of massive stars, making them powerful tracers of
star formation across cosmic time. Evidence for this origin comes from the
presence of supernovae in the aftermath of the GRB event, whose properties in
turn link back to those of the collapsing star. In principle, with GRBs we can
study the properties of individual stars in the distant universe. Here, we
present JWST/NIRCAM observations that detect both the host galaxy and likely
supernova in the SVOM GRB 250314A with a spectroscopically measured redshift of
z $\simeq$ 7.3, deep in the era of reionisation. The data are well described by
a combination of faint blue host, similar to many z $\sim$ 7 galaxies, with a
supernova of similar luminosity to the proto-type GRB supernova, SN 1998bw.
Although larger galaxy contributions cannot be robustly excluded, given the
evidence from the blue afterglow colours of low dust extinction, supernovae
much brighter than SN 1998bw can be. These observations suggest that, despite
disparate physical conditions, the star that created GRB 250314A was similar to
GRB progenitors in the local universe.

Method: 利用JWST在爆炸后33.6天获取近红外和中红外光谱，分析其结构和成分。

Result: 红外光谱显示H线主导，揭示了光学光谱中未见的结构，但未检测到CO等尘埃前体分子或尘埃存在的证据。

Abstract: We present and analyze panchromatic (0.35-14 $\mu$m) spectroscopy of the Type
II supernova 2023ixf, including near- and mid-infrared spectra obtained 33.6
days after explosion during the plateau-phase, with the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST). This is the first in a series of papers examining the
evolution of SN 2023ixf with JWST spanning the initial 1000 days after
explosion, monitoring the formation and growth of molecules and dust in ejecta
and surrounding environment. The JWST infrared spectra are overwhelmingly
dominated by H lines, whose profiles reveal ejecta structures unseen in optical
spectra. We characterize the nature of these structures, concluding that they
likely result from a combination of ejecta geometry, viewing angle, and opacity
effects. We find no evidence for the formation of dust precursor molecules such
as carbon-monoxide (CO), nor do we observe an infrared excess attributable to
dust. These observations imply that any future signatures of molecules or dust
in SN 2023ixf will arise either from freshly synthesized material within the
ejecta or circumstellar material at radii not yet heated by the supernova at
this epoch.

Motivation: 研究SS433系统的X射线发射特性，以理解其喷流驱动机制和观测条件对结构的影响。

Method: 基于24次观测数据，应用能量依赖的亚像素事件重定位算法和Richardson-Lucy反卷积方法增强空间分辨率。

Result: 发现距离核心约1.7角秒的结状结构，X射线与射电辐射尺度相似，但亮度对比不同；核心光谱显示热等离子体发射，外围区域则主要为非热过程。

Conclusion: SS433系统的X射线结构可能受观测条件影响，但反映了相对稳定的喷流驱动机制。

Abstract: We present a spatial and spectral analysis of arcsecond-scale X-ray emission
in SS433 using zeroth-order data from Chandra High-Energy Transmission Grating
(HETG) observations. The analysis is based on 24 observations acquired between
1999 and 2024, comprising a total exposure of $\sim$850 ks and covering a wide
range of orbital and precessional phases. Among these, the $\sim$140 ks
observation from 2014 was analyzed in detail for this study. This data provides
the best statistics and was taken when the jets were nearly perpendicular to
the line of sight and the accretion disk was eclipsed. By applying an
energy-dependent subpixel event repositioning algorithm and the Richardson-Lucy
deconvolution, we enhanced the spatial resolution and revealed eastern and
western knot-like structures at a distance of $\sim$1.7 arcsec ($\sim 10^{17}$
cm) from the core. These features are consistent with the kinematic precession
model, and the positions of the knots suggest that they were ejected
approximately 200 days prior to the observation. A comparison with VLA radio
data obtained at a similar precessional phase shows that the X-ray emission
extends east-west on a scale comparable to that of the radio emission. While
the core is bright in both X-rays and radio, the brightness contrast between
the knots and the core is smaller in X-rays than in radio. Spatially resolved
spectroscopy indicates that prominent Fe lines in the core X-ray spectrum are
well explained by thermal plasma emission. In contrast, Fe lines are not
evident in the outer regions after accounting for potential core contamination,
suggesting a dominant contribution from non-thermal processes. These findings
imply that the arcsecond-scale X-ray structures may vary observationally with
viewing conditions or precessional phase, but likely reflect a relatively
stable jet-driving mechanism operating within the SS 433 system.

Abstract: A theory of cosmic-ray transport in multi-phase diffusive media is developed,
with the specific application to cases in which the cosmic-ray diffusion
coefficient has large spatial fluctuations that may be inherently multi-scale.
We demonstrate that the resulting transport of cosmic rays is diffusive in the
long-time limit, with an average diffusion coefficient equal to the harmonic
mean of the spatially varying diffusion coefficient. Thus, cosmic-ray transport
is dominated by areas of low diffusion even if these areas occupy a relatively
small, but not infinitesimal, fraction of the volume. On intermediate time
scales, the cosmic rays experience transient effective sub-diffusion, as a
result of low-diffusion regions interrupting long flights through
high-diffusion regions. In the simplified case of a two-phase medium, we show
that the extent and extremity of the sub-diffusivity of cosmic-ray transport is
controlled by the spectral exponent of the distribution of patch sizes of each
of the phases. We finally show that, despite strongly influencing the
confinement times, the multi-phase medium is only capable of altering the
energy dependence of cosmic-ray transport when there is a moderate (but not
excessive) level of perpendicular diffusion across magnetic-field lines.

Abstract: Unveiling the sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays remains one of the
main challenges of high-energy astrophysics. Measurements of anisotropies in
their arrival directions are key to identifying their sources, yet magnetic
deflections obscure direct associations. In this work, we reconstruct the sky
regions of possible origin of the highest-energy cosmic-ray events detected by
the Pierre Auger Observatory by tracing their trajectories through Galactic
magnetic fields using up-to-date models, while fully accounting for energy and
directional uncertainties. A mixed composition at injection is assumed to model
the detected charge distributions of such events. Different classes of
astrophysical sources are investigated and tested for a correlation with the
inferred regions of origin of the events. By incorporating constraints on the
maximum propagation distances, we also allow for a three-dimensional
localization of the possible source regions. Our findings provide new
constraints on the sources of the highest-energy cosmic particles and offer
fresh insights into the role of Galactic magnetic fields in shaping the
observed ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray sky.

Abstract: Measurements of anisotropies in the arrival directions of ultra-high-energy
cosmic rays are crucial to pinpoint their sources, which are yet to be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子俘获超新星（ECSNe）是低质量中子星的重要形成通道，近年来观测证据（如SN~2018zd）支持了这一理论。研究ADM对ECSNe前身星及其残余的影响，有助于理解暗物质在恒星演化中的作用。

Method: 采用广义相对论的双流体形式，模拟普通物质（OM）和ADM的耦合演化，假设重子数和暗物质粒子数守恒，研究富氖白矮星（Ne WDs）的塌缩过程。

Result: ADM显著提高了前身星的中央密度，降低了电子俘获的阈值质量，可能导致更低质量的前身星形成ECSNe，残余为稳定的暗物质混合中子星。ADM还减少了塌缩过程中的转换能量，低能ECSNe可能是ADM参与的标志。

Conclusion: ADM对ECSNe前身星及其残余的形成有显著影响，可能导致低质量中子星和低能超新星，为暗物质在恒星演化中的作用提供了新线索。

Abstract: Electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe) have emerged as a compelling formation
channel for low-mass neutron stars, bolstered by decades of theoretical work
and increasingly supported by observational evidence, including the recent
identification of SN~2018zd. Motivated by this, we investigate the influence of
fermionic asymmetric dark matter (ADM) on the equilibrium structure of
progenitor cores and the formation of their neutron star remnants. Using a
general relativistic two-fluid formalism, we model the coupled evolution of
ordinary matter (OM) and ADM, treated as separately conserved fluids
interacting solely through gravity. Our analysis focuses on neon-rich white
dwarfs (Ne WDs), which are typical progenitor cores for ECSNe. We assume
conservation of both baryon number ($N_B$) and dark matter particle number
($N_D$) during collapse, allowing for a consistent mapping between progenitor
and remnant configurations. We find that ADM significantly enhances the central
density of the WD progenitor. This lowers the threshold gravitational mass
$M^*$ required to initiate electron capture, enabling ECSNe from lower-mass
progenitors. The resulting remnants are stable, dark matter-admixed neutron
stars with gravitational masses potentially well below current observational
bounds. Moreover, we find that the conversion energy during the WD-to-NS
conversion is also significantly reduced for higher ADM particle masses and
fractions, suggesting that unusually low-energy ECSNe may serve as potential
indicators of ADM involvement in stellar collapse.

Abstract: Measuring proton-proton interaction cross-sections at center-of-mass energies
above 40 TeV remains a significant challenge in particle physics. The Pierre
Auger Observatory provides a unique opportunity to study the interactions at
the highest energies through the distribution of the depth of maximum shower
development ($X_\mathrm{max}$) observed by its Fluorescence Detector. In
previous studies, the determination of the interaction cross-section at
ultrahigh energies has relied on the assumption that the tail of the
$X_\mathrm{max}$ distribution is proton-dominated, which restricts the analysis
to a limited energy range below the ankle and introduces related systematic
uncertainties. In this contribution, we adopt a novel method for the
simultaneous estimation of the proton-proton interaction cross-section and the
primary cosmic-ray mass composition using data from the Pierre Auger
Observatory, avoiding assumptions about one quantity to infer the other and
thus improving the accuracy and robustness of our analysis. In addition, a
systematic shift in the $X_\mathrm{max}$ scale is fitted to account for both
experimental uncertainties and theoretical constraints on the modeling of
particle interactions. The obtained results are consistent with previous
analyses and provide additional constraints on hadronic interaction models. The
measured proton-proton inelastic cross-section at ultra-high energies agrees
well with extrapolations of accelerator data. The inferred cosmic-ray
composition and the $X_\mathrm{max}$-scale shift are also compatible with
previous estimates.

Motivation: 自由漂浮天体（如流氓行星、褐矮星等）在银河系中普遍存在，但其数量密度尚不明确。通过毫秒脉冲星的定时数据，可以探测这些天体对脉冲到达时间的引力扰动。

Method: 利用NANOGrav 15年窄带数据集，对68颗毫秒脉冲星进行高精度定时分析，搜索FFOs与脉冲星之间的双曲散射事件。

Conclusion: 这是首次通过脉冲星定时数据对FFOs数量密度进行约束，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Free-floating objects (FFOs) in interstellar space$-$rogue planets, brown
dwarfs, and large asteroids that are not gravitationally bound to any
star$-$are expected to be ubiquitous throughout the Milky Way. Recent
microlensing surveys have discovered several free-floating planets that are not
bound to any known stellar systems. Additionally, three interstellar objects,
namely 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov, and 3I/ATLAS, have been detected passing
through our solar system on hyperbolic trajectories. In this work, we search
for FFOs on hyperbolic orbits that pass near millisecond pulsars (MSPs), where
their gravitational influence can induce detectable perturbations in pulse
arrival times. Using the NANOGrav 15-year narrowband dataset, which contains
high-precision timing data for 68 MSPs, we conduct a search for such hyperbolic
scattering events between FFOs and pulsars. Although no statistically
significant events were detected, this non-detection enables us to place upper
limits on the number density of FFOs as a function of their mass within our
local region of the Galaxy. For example, the upper limit on the number density
for Jupiter-mass FFOs ($\sim 10^{-2.5} - 10^{-3.5}~M_{\odot}$) obtained from
different pulsars ranges from $5.25\times10^{6}~\text{pc}^{-3}$ to
$5.37\times10^{9}~\text{pc}^{-3}$, while the upper limit calculated by
combining results from all the pulsars is $6.03\times10^{5}~\text{pc}^{-3}$.
These results represent the first constraints on FFO population derived from
pulsar timing data.

Conclusion: GB6 B1428+4217是典型的MeV耀变体，其耀发事件对理解早期宇宙喷流物理至关重要。

Abstract: In November 2023, the Fermi Large Area Telescope detected a $\gamma$-ray
flare from the high-redshift blazar GB6 B1428+4217 ($z=4.715$). We initiated a
multi-wavelength follow-up campaign involving Swift, NuSTAR, the Sierra Nevada
and Perkins Observatories, and the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope. This
source, also known as 5BZQ J1430+4204, has shown an anomalous soft X-ray
spectrum in previous observations, including possible ionized absorption
features or signatures of bulk Comptonization of thermal electrons, which are
also detected during the flaring episode. Simultaneous optical data revealed a
polarization fraction of ${\sim}8$\% in the R band, confirming that synchrotron
emission dominated over thermal emission from the accretion disk. The hard
X-ray flux was enhanced during the flare. Modeling of the broadband spectral
energy distribution suggests that the high-energy component is dominated by
Compton scattering by external seed photons from the accretion disk. The origin
of the flare is consistent with the injection of a hard-spectrum electron
population in the emission region. With a $\gamma$-ray luminosity among the top
5% of flaring events, GB6 B1428+4217 exemplifies a prototypical MeV blazar. Its
Compton-dominated SED and extreme luminosity are in line with expectations from
the blazar sequence. High-redshift flares like this are critical for
understanding jet physics in the early Universe and may improve detection
prospects with future missions such as COSI.

Motivation: ACT合作组的最新结果表明标量谱指数较高（$n_s = 0.9743 \pm 0.0034$），对现有暴胀模型（如Starobinsky模型）提出了挑战，因此需要探索新的理论框架。

Method: 在EGB引力理论中引入分数幂标量势，结合慢滚近似，分析标量场与高斯-博内特项的耦合对宇宙学动力学的影响。

Result: 模型预测的$n_s$和$r$值落在ACT约束的$1\sigma$范围内，且标量谱指数的运行进一步验证了模型与观测的一致性。

Conclusion: EGB框架下的分数幂标量势模型不仅与ACT数据一致，还满足再加热温度下限，提供了一个可行的宇宙学方案。

Abstract: Recent results from the ACT collaboration indicate a higher value for the
scalar spectral index, with $n_s = 0.9743 \pm 0.0034$, which sets tighter
constraints on inflationary models, and these shifts are not in favor of many
pre existing scenarios, including the widely studied and accepted standard
Starobinsky model. In this paper, we examine the fractional power scalar
potential within the framework of Einstein Gauss Bonnet (EGB) gravity,
incorporating standard slow roll approximation. The EGB theory, motivated by
higher dimensional models, introduces quadratic curvature corrections and a
coupling between the scalar field and the Gauss Bonnet term, thereby modifying
the cosmological dynamics. The results show good agreement with observational
data, placing the predictions within the $1 \sigma$ region of the ACT $r-n_s$
constraint plot. Furthermore, incorporating the running of the scalar spectral
index reinforces the models consistency with observational bounds. We also
explore the parameter space of the EGB couplings and identify the range of free
parameters for which the results of $n_s$ and $r$ values remain within the $1
\sigma$ region of the ACT constraints. Finally, we also investigate the
reheating phase, demonstrating that the model not only agrees with ACT data but
also satisfies the lower bound on the reheating temperature, thereby ensuring a
consistent and viable cosmological scenario.

Motivation: 传统3D方法对非线性动力学扭曲（如Finger-of-God效应）敏感，而角$D_2$方法能减少这种敏感性，提供更稳健的宇宙学参数估计。

Method: 使用MultiDark-Patchy和EZmock星系目录评估$D_2$和偏差测量的尺度依赖性，限制最小共动角尺度以减少FoG建模的系统误差。

Result: 通过SDSS DR12和DR16数据，得到$\omega_m = 0.142^{+0.014}_{-0.022}$，与当前CMB分析一致。

Conclusion: 角$D_2$曲线是一种模型独立且稳健的工具，适用于宇宙学参数推断。

Abstract: We present a novel cosmological analysis based on the angular correlation
dimension $D_2$ curve, a cumulative statistic derived from the two-point
correlation function. Unlike traditional 3D approaches, angular $D_2$ is
inherently less sensitive to nonlinear dynamical distortions, such as the
small-scale Finger-of-God (FoG) effect. Using both MultiDark-Patchy and EZmock
galaxy catalogs, we assess the scale-dependent impact of redshift-space
distortions on $D_2$ and bias measurements. We demonstrate that the systematic
errors associated with FoG modeling can be significantly reduced by restricting
the analysis to appropriate minimum comoving angular scales of $\sim
1.25^{\circ} $, which corresponds to comoving scales of $\sim
20\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ within the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Since the
observational estimative of $D_2(\theta)$ is not dependent on a cosmological
model we obtain robust estimates of the galaxy bias and place competitive
constraints on the physical matter density $\omega_m$. By applying this
framework to SDSS DR12 and DR16 Luminous Red Galaxy data, we obtain $\omega_m =
0.142^{+0.014}_{-0.022}$ (1$\sigma$), which agrees with current CMB analyses.
Our results highlight the potential of the angular $D_2$ curve as a
model-independent and robust tool for cosmological parameter inference.

Conclusion: 该估计器为星系-星系弱透镜分析提供了高效且准确的工具，适用于大范围多极矩，并能通过分片加权进一步优化统计精度。

Abstract: Galaxy-galaxy weak lensing provides a powerful means of measuring the average
matter distribution around lens galaxies -- i.e., the galaxy bias relation.
Properly accounting for the spin-2 nature of weak lensing distortions, we
develop a quadratic estimator for measuring the $E$- and $B$-mode angular power
spectra from galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, correcting for survey window effects
arising from, for example, survey geometry and bright star masks. The estimator
can be implemented efficiently by adopting FFTs on pixelized maps of the lens
galaxy distribution and source galaxy ellipticities, under the flat-sky
approximation. Using simulated weak lensing fields and halo catalogs in the
light-cone ray-tracing simulations, we show that the estimator can recover the
underlying $E$-mode power spectrum, $C_{{\rm g}E}(\ell)$, to within a few
percent in fractional error, while minimizing the leakage of $E$-mode into the
$B$-mode power spectrum, in each multipole bin over the wide range of
multipoles (up to $\ell \sim 3000$ studied in this paper). We then discuss that
the estimator can be used to estimate the 3D galaxy-matter power spectrum,
$P_{\rm gm}(k)$, by dividing lens galaxies into multiple redshift slices. We
also derive an optimal weighting for each lens redshift slice in the shot
noise-limited regime for the estimation of $P_{\rm gm}(k)$, which reduces the
statistical errors by up to $\sim$20\% compared to the case without weighting.

Abstract: The dispersion measure-redshift relation of fast radio bursts (FRBs) provides
a valuable cosmological probe for constraining the Hubble constant, offering an
independent measurement that could help resolve the ongoing Hubble tension. In
this paper, we begin with a sample of 117 localized FRBs and use 95 of them to
constrain $H_0$ to $71.28^{+1.90}_{-2.08}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ within the
standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. The resulting
statistical uncertainty is below 2.8\%, improving previous FRB-based
measurements and highlighting the promise of larger future samples. Beyond
statistical improvements, we note that different parameter choices have been
adopted in previous studies and some results show discrepancies in $H_0$. To
address this issue, we perform a systematic assessment of modeling
uncertainties that can affect the inferred value of $H_0$, including Galactic
electron density models, the contribution of the Galactic halo, outliers such
as FRB~20190520B located in extreme environments, and the other parameter
selections. We also discuss possible approaches to mitigate these sources of
uncertainty, emphasizing both the challenges and prospects of using FRBs as
reliable cosmological tools.

Abstract: Galaxies whose images overlap in the focal plane of a telescope, commonly
referred to as blends, are often located at different redshifts. Blending
introduces a challenge to weak lensing cosmology probes, as such blends are
subject to shear signals from multiple redshifts. This effect can be described
by joining shear bias and redshift characterisation in the effective redshift
distribution, $n_{\gamma}(z)$, which includes the response of apparent shapes
of detected objects to shear of galaxies at redshift $z$. In this work, we
propose a novel method to correct $n_{\gamma}(z)$ for redshift-mixed blending
by emulating the shear response to neighbouring galaxies. Specifically, we
design a ``half-sky-shearing'' simulation with HSC-Wide-like specifications, in
which we extract the response of a detected object's measured ellipticity to
shear of neighbouring galaxies among numerous galaxy pairs. We demonstrate the
feasibility of accurately emulating these pairwise responses and validate the
robustness of our approach under varying observing conditions and galaxy
population uncertainties. We find that the effective redshift of sources at the
high-redshift tail of the distribution is about 0.05 lower than expected when
not modelling the effect. Given appropriately processed image simulations, our
correction method can be readily incorporated into future cosmological analyses
to mitigate this source of systematic error.

Motivation: 探索动能主导时期标量不均匀性的非线性演化及其对宇宙动力学的影响，特别是原初黑洞形成和宇宙再加热的可能性。

Method: 使用数值相对论完全演化爱因斯坦方程，追踪亚视界和超视界初始波长的标量扰动的非线性增长。

Result: 亚视界扰动符合微扰理论，而超视界扰动表现出更复杂的非线性行为。

Conclusion: 超视界扰动的非线性动力学可能为原初黑洞形成和宇宙再加热提供新机制。

Abstract: We investigate the effects of large scalar inhomogeneities during the
kination epoch, a period in which the universe's dynamics are dominated by the
kinetic energy of a scalar field, by fully evolving the Einstein equations
using numerical relativity. By tracking the non-linear growth of scalar
perturbations with both sub-horizon and super-horizon initial wavelengths, we
are able to compare their evolution to perturbative results. Our key findings
show that in the deep sub-horizon limit, the perturbative behaviour remains
valid, whereas in the super-horizon regime, non-linear dynamics exhibit a much
richer phenomenology. Finally, we discuss the possibility of primordial black
hole formation from the collapse of such perturbations and assess whether this
process could serve as a viable mechanism to reheat the universe in the
post-inflationary era.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨延迟通胀起始（k_min）对CMB观测的影响，以解决理论与观测之间的不一致性，并为早期宇宙的暴胀阶段提供更一致的解释。

Method: 在Planck-LCDM框架下，计算有/无k_min的角功率谱和相关函数，分析其对温度、极化及其交叉相关的影响。

Result: 非零k_min显著改善理论与观测的一致性，并在角功率谱和相关函数中产生可观测特征。B模式极化数据目前精度不足，但未来高精度任务（如LiteBIRD）可能探测到其影响。

Conclusion: 引入k_min不仅解决CMB大角度异常，还为理解早期宇宙暴胀提供更一致框架，未来高精度观测对验证k_min至关重要。

Abstract: We investigate the impact of a hypothesized delayed initiation of inflation,
characterized by a cutoff k_min to the primordial power spectrum in the cosmic
microwave background (CMB). This cutoff affects both the scalar and tensor
spectra, which therefore impacts several measurements of the temperature and
polarization distributions. We calculate the angular power spectrum and
correlation function with and without k_min in the context of Planck-LCDM, and
demonstrate that a non-zero k_min significantly improves the alignment between
theory and the observations, including the temperature, E-mode polarization, TE
cross-correlation, Q+U polarization and Q-U polarization. It creates an
observable signature in both the angular power spectrum and correlation
function for all cases. We thus also explore the B-mode polarization, for which
current data are not yet precise enough to determine k_min, but whose impact
should be detectable with high-precision measurements using future missions,
such as LiteBIRD, if the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r, is not much smaller than
its current upper limit. We find that the introduction of k_min not only
addresses large-angle anomalies in the CMB but also provides a more consistent
framework for understanding the early Universe's inflationary phase. These
findings highlight the importance of future high-precision CMB observations in
validating the existence and implications of k_min.

Abstract: In order to derive model-independent observational bounds on dark
energy/modified gravity theories, a typical approach is to constrain
parametrised models intended to capture the space of dark energy theories. Here
we investigate in detail the effect that the nature of these parametrisations
can have, finding significant effects on the resulting cosmological dark energy
constraints. In order to observationally distinguish well-motivated and
physical parametrisations from unphysical ones, it is crucial to understand the
theoretical priors that physical parametrisations place on the phenomenology of
dark energy. To this end we discuss a range of theoretical priors that can be
imposed on general dark energy parametrisations, and their effect on the
constraints on the phenomenology of dynamical dark energy. More specifically,
we investigate both the phenomenological $\{\mu,\Sigma\}$ parametrisation as
well as effective field theory (EFT) inspired approaches to model dark energy
interactions. We compare the constraints obtained in both approaches for
different phenomenological and theory-informed time-dependences for the
underlying functional degrees of freedom, discuss the effects of priors derived
from gravitational wave physics, and investigate the interplay between
constraints on parameters constraining only the background evolution vs.
parameters controlling linear perturbations.

The Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer\n(GOTO), with its wide field of view, dual-site coverage, and robotic\nrapid-response capability, bridges this gap by rapidly identifying and\nlocalising afterglows from alerts issued by space-based facilities including\nFermi, SVOM, Swift, and the EP, providing early optical positions for\ncoordinated multi-wavelength follow-up. In this paper, we present optical\nafterglow localisation and multi-band follow-up of seven Fermi/GBM and MAXI/GSC\ntriggered long GRBs (240122A, 240225B, 240619A, 240910A, 240916A, 241002B, and\n241228B) discovered by GOTO in 2024. Spectroscopy for six GRBs (no\nspectroscopic data for GRB 241002B) with VLT/X-shooter and GTC/OSIRIS yields\nprecise redshifts spanning $z\\approx0.40-$3.16 and absorption-line diagnostics\nof host and intervening systems. Radio detections for four events confirm the\npresence of long-lived synchrotron emission. Prompt-emission analysis with\nFermi and MAXI data reveals a spectrally hard population, with two bursts lying\n$>3\\sigma$ above the Amati relation. Although their optical afterglows resemble\nthose of typical long GRBs, the prompt spectra are consistently harder than the\nlong-GRB average. Consistent modelling of six GOTO-discovered GRB afterglows\nyields jet half-opening angles of a few degrees and beaming-corrected kinetic\nenergies ($E_{jet}\\sim10^{51-52}$) erg, consistent with the canonical long-GRB\npopulation. These findings suggest that optical discovery of poorly localised\nGRBs may be subject to observational biases favouring luminous events with high\nspectral peak energy, while also providing insight into jet microphysics and\ncentral engine diversity."}

Measuring the excited fundamental modes of neutron\nstars in gravitational-wave signals offers a promising solution, as these modes\nencode information about stellar composition, structure, and dynamics.

We consider a range in possible spectra\nfor the HMXBs and star formation efficiencies, as well as the possible effect\nof an extended halo around the galaxy. We find detection of the signal would\nrequire integration times of a few thousand hours using SKA1-Low except for a\nbright galaxy like a starburst, but only a thousand hours for the expected\nnoise levels of SKA2-Low. Depending on the surrounding gas density profile, the\n21-cm signature of X-ray heating may still require an exceptionally high star\nformation rate, either intrinsic to the source or provided by other systems\nclustered near it, to avoid dominance of the signal by absorption from the\nsurrounding gas."}

A\nslab corona may not explain the hard state observations of X-ray binaries\n(XRBs). We incorporate energy feedback to the accretion disk resulting from\nillumination by an extended corona, and vice versa. The interaction between\nthese two components allows for the possibility of finding an energetically\nself-consistent equilibrium solution for a given disk-corona system. We have\nupgraded the existing Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, MONK, to incorporate\nthe interaction between the disk and the extended corona within the general\nrelativistic framework. We introduce an albedo parameter to specify the\nfraction of the incident flux that is reflected by the disk, while the\nremainder is absorbed and added to the intrinsic dissipation. Reflection is\nmodeled assuming a semi-infinite electron atmosphere. We find global\nequilibrium solutions by iterating interaction between disk and extended slab\ncorona. A higher black hole spin, higher coronal temperature, and higher albedo\nall lead to harder spectra. For typical coronal temperatures and disk albedo,\nthe lowest achievable photon index with a static slab corona fully covering the\ndisk is approximately 1.7-1.8. With the upgraded version of MONK, we are now\nable to achieve global energy equilibrium for a given disk-corona system. This\napproach holds significant potential for constraining the coronal geometry\nusing not only the observed flux but also polarization. A static slab does not\nappear to be a favorable coronal geometry for the hard state of XRBs, even when\nglobal energy balance is taken into account. In future work, we will explore\ntruncated disk geometries and outflowing coronae as potential alternatives.\n(shortened)"}

Using fully relativistic nonlinear numerical\nsimulations in spherical symmetry, based on the Misner--Sharp formalism, we\nanalyze the dynamics near the collapse threshold and track the scaling of the\nblack hole mass. Our results confirm that both the scalar field and radiation\ncases exhibit type II critical behavior with similar -- though not identical --\ncritical exponents, differing by about $2\\sigma$. This suggests that, while a\nquartic scalar field effectively mimics a radiation fluid even in the nonlinear\ncollapse regime, small differences in the critical exponent persist.

First seen in\nVLA data, these parsec-scale jets arise from jet-ISM interaction and show a\nZ-shaped morphology. Using the MeerKAT telescope we observed GRS1758-258 in\nL-band for a total exposure of 7 hr.

Within the northern jet lobe we identify synchrotron and\nbremsstrahlung emission, while the southern lobe is dominated by thermal\nemission. We measure ISM densities between 10-40 cm-3 across both jets,\nslightly lower in the northern region. The estimated ages of the two lobes\nrange from 6-51 kyr. The time-averaged jet power lies between 4.4x10^33 and\n3.3x10^36 erg/s, with differences between north and south likely due to\ndifferent local ISM conditions. Comparing new MeerKAT with archival VLA data,\nwe measured a proper motion of 130 mas/yr in a portion of the northern jet.\nJet-ISM interaction structures on both sides of GRS1758-258 reveal different\nISM properties. The comparison between these structures and those from other\nXRBs suggests that the lobes in GRS1758-258 are younger and may result from\ndifferent jet activity phases.

The FLAMINGO simulation variant with the most gas expulsion, and\ntherefore the most suppression of the matter power spectrum relative to a dark\nmatter only simulation, provides a good description of how much gas is expelled\nand how far it extends; the enhanced gas depletion is achieved by more powerful\nbut less frequent AGN outbursts.

We extend the analysis to simulations of self-interacting\nspinning boson stars, using synthetic signals that exhibit (a) both SIQM and\ntidal effects and (b) each effect individually.

For case (b),\nwe employ (i) a BBH model and (ii) models incorporating either SIQM or tidal\neffects, consistent with the injection. Simulations employ TaylorF2 waveform\nmodel and consider binaries in the low mass gap with varying spin magnitudes.\nWe find that employing an incorrect model to analyze the signal can lead to\nbiases in parameter inference.

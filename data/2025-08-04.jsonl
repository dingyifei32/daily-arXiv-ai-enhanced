We map the outflows\ninto the FLASH hydrodynamics code to model their expansion in axisymmetry, and\nstudy the effects of employing different $r$-process heating rates. Except for\nthe highest heating rate prescription, we find no significant differences with\nrespect to overall ejecta dynamics and morphology compared to the simulation\nwithout heating. Once homologous expansion is attained, typically after $\\sim$\n2s for these ejecta, we map the outflows to the Sedona radiative transfer code\nand compute the spectral evolution of the kilonova and broadband light curves\nin various LSST bands. The kilonova properties depend on the remnant lifetime,\nwith peak luminosities and peak timescales increasing for longer-lived remnants\nthat produce more massive ejecta. For all models, there is a strong dependence\nof both the bolometric and broadband light curves on the viewing angle. While\nthe short-lived (12ms) remnant produces higher luminosities when viewed from\nangles closer to the pole, longer-lived remnants (240ms and 2.5s) are more\nluminous when viewed from angles closer to the equator. Our results highlight\nthe importance of self-consistent, long-term modeling of merger ejecta, and\ntaking viewing-angle dependence into account when interpreting observed\nkilonova light curves. We find that magnetized outflows from a HMNS -- if it\nsurvives long enough -- could explain blue kilonovae, such as the blue emission\nseen in AT2017gfo."}

We conducted deep\noptical and NIR photometric and spectroscopic late-time search for an\nassociated supernova (SN)/kilonova (KN) and the host galaxy using 10.4 m GTC\nand 8.4 m binocular LBT telescopes. No bright SN (like SN 1998bw) is detected\ndown to stringent limits (e.g., $m_r > 26.1$ mag at 17.59 days), despite a\nredshift of $z$ = 0.659 measured from GTC spectroscopy.

In the atmospheres of neutron stars, the presence of magnetic\nfields alters the photon-electron scattering cross sections, resulting in\nnon-trivial angular dependence of intensity and polarization of the emergent\nsignals. This paper presents recent developments of our Monte Carlo simulation,\nMAGTHOMSCATT, which tracks the complex electric field vector for each photon\nduring its transport. Our analysis encompasses the anisotropy and polarization\ncharacteristics of X-ray emission for field strengths ranging from non-magnetic\nto extremely magnetized regimes that are germane to magnetars. In the very low\nfield domain, we reproduced the numerical solution to the radiative transfer\nequation for non-magnetic Thomson scattering, and provided analytical fits for\nthe angular dependence of the intensity and the polarization degree. These fits\ncan be useful for studies of millisecond pulsars and magnetic white dwarfs. By\nimplementing a refined injection protocol, we show that, in the magnetar\nregime, the simulated intensity and polarization pulse profiles of emission\nfrom extended surface regions becomes invariant with respect to the ratio of\nphoton ($\\omega$) and electron cyclotron ($\\omega_{\\rm B}$) frequencies once\n$\\omega / \\omega_{\\rm B} \\lesssim 0.01$.

However, definite proofs about\nthe progenitor and central engine of these GRBs have not been directly observed\nin the past. Here we report the existence of a Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO)\nsignature with periodic frequency $\\sim$0.02 Hz in the early X-ray afterglow\nphase of GRB 220711B. Such a low-frequency QPO likely signals the precession of\na relativistic jet launched from a GRB hyper-accreting black hole central\nengine. The energy injection signature from the \\textbf{late} X-ray\nobservations (from $5\\times 10^2s\\sim 1\\times10^4s$) is consistent with the\nprecession hypothesis. The prompt $\\gamma$-ray light curve does not show any\nQPO signature, suggesting that the X-ray flaring emission in the early\nafterglow phase and prompt emission likely originate from different accretion\nprocessess, indicating that the progenitor stars of GRBs have a core-envelope\nstructure with a stratified angular momentum distribution and the late-time\naccretion disk likely has a misalignment with respect to the rotation axis of\nthe black hole. Such a misalignment is not expected in a canonical collapsar\nmodel.

By analysing the light curves of\nboth prompt emission and X-ray afterglow, no high-confidence-level\nquasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) signals are found in the light curves of the\nprompt emission (e.g., BAT and GBM), but it is found that a QPO signal at\n$\\sim$ 50 s above 6$\\sigma$ confidence level indeed exist in the X-ray\nafterglow.

The initial plateau emission and followed decay segment,\nas well as the extremely steep-decay segment, are consistent with the physical\nprocess of supra-massive magnetar spin-down and then collapse into black hole.\nMoreover, the QPO signal in the X-ray emission can be explained as an effect of\nthe precession motion of the magnetar.

In this work, we analyze the photon time-of-flight\nand time-shift data from LHAASO observations of Gamma-Ray Burst GRB 221009A to\nsearch for signatures of Lorentz violation. We employed the DisCan (dispersion\ncancellation) method with various information entropies as cost functions,\ndesignating the results obtained with Shannon entropy as our representative\noutcome. This choice is attributed to the parameter-free statistical properties\nof Shannon entropy, which has demonstrated remarkable stability as we\ncontinually refine and enhance our methodology. In the absence of more detailed\ndata and physical context, it provides more stable and reliable results. We\nconstrain the energy scale associated with Lorentz invariance violation.

In this Letter, we show that this peak\ndoes not necessarily imply a true crossing of the phantom divide if the\nmeasured effective DE is not a single component, but a combination of standard\nand negative quintessence. The latter is characterized by negative energy\ndensity and positive pressure, both decreasing in absolute value and tending to\n0 in the future. For appropriate values of the parameters, negative\nquintessence is relevant at intermediate redshifts and becomes subdominant in\nfront of standard quintessence around $z\\sim 0.4-0.5$, giving rise to the\naforementioned peak in the DE density.

In this\nwork, we perform the first weak lensing test of the connections between the\nmagnitude gap and the halo profile. We measure the halo profiles of isolated\ncentral galaxies (ICGs) selected primarily from the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample.\nHalo mass and concentration are inferred by fitting stacked lensing profiles in\nbins of central luminosity, $L_\\mathrm{c}$, and the central-satellite magnitude\ngap, $L_\\mathrm{gap}$. We detect dependence on the magnitude gap in both halo\nproperties. The dependence is the strongest in the ICG luminosity range of\n$10^{10.3}<L_\\mathrm{c}[h^{-2}L_\\odot]\\leq 10^{10.7}$, where halos with smaller\ngaps have higher masses and lower concentrations. When $10^{10.7}\n<L_c[h^{-2}L_\\odot] \\leq 10^{11.1}$, however, no significant gap dependence is\ndetected. In the range of $10^{9.9}<L_\\mathrm{c}[h^{-2}L_\\odot] \\leq\n10^{10.3}$, a disordering of the gap dependence is marginally observable. We\ncompare the observational results with predictions by two lightcone catalogs\nbuilt from the Illustris TNG300 and the Millennium simulations.

In this paper, we scrutinize GW production during axion inflation in the\ngradient expansion formalism (GEF), a powerful numerical technique that\ncaptures the nonlinear dynamics of the system in the limit of vanishing axion\ngradients.

### [1] [From Theory to Forecast: Neutrino Mass Effects on Mode-Coupling Kernels and Their Observational Implications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06759)
*Farshad Kamalinejad,Zachary Slepian*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种包含中微子效应的1-loop修正的功率谱解析表达式，并利用FFTLog算法加速计算。通过功率谱和双谱模型，研究了中微子质量对宇宙学参数估计的影响，并展示了双谱对参数约束的改进作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究中微子质量对宇宙学参数估计的影响，并探讨双谱在提高参数约束精度方面的潜力。

Method: 使用FFTLog算法加速1-loop修正计算，构建功率谱和双谱模型，并通过拟合模拟数据和Fisher预测分析参数约束。

Result: 中微子质量对参数估计的影响有限，但双谱的加入显著降低了关键参数（如中微子质量）的不确定性约20%。

Conclusion: 双谱分析能有效提升宇宙学参数约束的精度，尤其是对中微子质量的测量。

Abstract: We present an analytical expression that gives both the matter and tracer
(halo or galaxy) power spectrum with 1-loop corrections that include the
neutrino effects on the mode coupling kernels. We use the FFTLog algorithm to
accelerate calculating the higher-order corrections to the power spectrum. We
then use our power spectrum and bispectrum models to pursue two main goals.
First, we examine the impact of neutrino mass on cosmological parameter
estimation from both the power spectrum and bispectrum in real space. We create
1-loop power spectrum and bispectrum templates in real-space and fit to the
\texttt{Quijote} simulation suite, including the cross-covariance between the
power spectrum and the bispectrum. We show the neutrino signature kernels
estimate the same cosmological parameters as the model with the SPT (Standard
Perturbation Theory) kernels, even for DESI Year 5 volume, except for the
galaxy bias parameters inferred from the bispectrum. Second, we investigate to
what extent the bispectrum can improve parameter constraints. We perform a
Fisher forecast using the power spectrum, the tree-level bispectrum, and a
joint analysis that includes the cross-covariance between them. We show that
including the bispectrum can substantially reduce the error bars on key
parameters. For the neutrino mass in particular, the uncertainty is reduced by
$\sim 20\%$

### [2] [Power Spectrum, Bispectrum, 2- and 3-Point Correlation Function, and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06762)
*Zachary Slepian,Farshad Kamalinejad,Alessandro Greco*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 论文概述了N点相关函数（如2PCF、3PCF）及其傅里叶空间类似物（功率谱、双谱）在宇宙学中的应用，包括它们的产生机制、计算方法及实际应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 展示了这些工具在数据分析中的最新应用。

Conclusion: 论文旨在帮助读者理解并应用这些算法，同时提供了相关资源以便进一步研究。

Abstract: N-Point Correlation Functions, usually with N = 2, 3, and their Fourier-space
analogs power spectrum and bispectrum, are major tools used in cosmology to
capture the clustering of large-scale structure. We outline how the clustering
these functions capture emerges, explain that inflation produces a 2PCF or
power spectrum but that subsequent evolution eventually produces a 3PCF or
bispectrum, and beyond (and that inflation may do so as well at some level).
Furthermore, in principle the Universe also has a 4PCF or trispectrum, and even
clustering beyond. For each of these tools, we discuss the motivation, the
practical details of how they are estimated, the current algorithms used to
compute them, the theory behind them, and recent applications to data.
Throughout, we focus on positioning the reader to find and apply these
algorithms with some understanding, linking to public code for each algorithm
to the fullest extent possible.

### [3] [Primordial Gravitational Waves in Parity-violating Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06984)
*Rongrong Zhai,Chengjie Fu,Xiangyun Fu,Puxun Wu,Hongwei Yu*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 论文研究了对称远平行引力的宇称破坏扩展在轴子暴胀中的应用，发现PV项导致张量扰动的速度双折射，并在暴胀期间引发特定尺度张量模式的显著放大，产生可被LISA和Taiji探测的原始引力波。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索宇称破坏引力和轴子暴胀的结合，以研究原始引力波的产生及其特性，为探测暴胀和PV引力理论提供新途径。

Method: 将PV扩展的对称远平行引力理论应用于轴子暴胀模型，分析张量扰动的速度双折射效应及其在暴胀期间的放大机制。

Result: 发现原始引力波具有单旋极化和多峰能量谱，其幅度和手性可能被LISA和Taiji网络探测到。

Conclusion: 这种手性引力波信号为研究暴胀和PV引力理论提供了新的探测机会。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the inflationary phenomenology of
parity-violating (PV) extensions of symmetric teleparallel gravity by applying
this PV gravity theory to axion inflation. The presence of PV terms induces
velocity birefringence in the tensor perturbations. During inflation, when the
inflaton rapidly traverses the cliff-like region in its potential, the tensor
modes at specific scales for one of the two circular polarization states
undergo significant amplification due to tachyonic instability. Consequently,
the resulting primordial gravitational waves (GWs), characterized by a
one-handed polarization and a multi-peak structure in their energy spectrum,
exhibit a significant amplitude potentially detectable by LISA and Taiji, and
their chirality could be determined by the LISA-Taiji network. The detection of
such a chiral GW signal provides an opportunity to probe inflation and PV
gravity theory.

### [4] [Testing the Cosmic Distance Duality Relation with Neural Kernel Gaussian Process Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07040)
*Xin Luo,Nan Liang*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 论文通过结合Pantheon+超新星数据和DESI DR2重子声学振荡数据，测试宇宙距离对偶关系（CDDR），并提出一种新方法NKGPR以解决数据集间的红移不匹配问题。结果显示CDDR在当前观测不确定性内保持一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证宇宙距离对偶关系（CDDR）的准确性，并解决不同数据集间的红移不匹配问题。

Method: 开发了Neural Kernel Gaussian Process Regression（NKGPR）方法，通过两个神经网络同时学习高斯过程的均值和核函数，改进传统高斯过程回归。

Result: 通过边际似然分析约束模型无关参数η₀，结果显示CDDR在当前观测不确定性内无显著偏离。

Conclusion: CDDR在当前观测数据下保持一致，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In this work, we test the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) by
combining Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) data and DESI DR2 baryon
acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements. To resolve the redshift mismatch
between the two datasets, we develop a new method called Neural Kernel Gaussian
Process Regression (NKGPR), which uses two neural networks to simultaneously
learn the mean and kernel functions of a Gaussian process. This approach
improves upon traditional Gaussian process regression by mitigating trend
mismatches and removing the need for manual kernel selection. We investigate
possible deviations from the CDDR by adopting three parameterizations of the
deviation function and constrain the model-independent parameter $\eta_0$
through a marginalized likelihood analysis. Our results show no significant
departure from the expected relation, confirming the consistency of the CDDR
within current observational uncertainties.

*Aurelien Verdier,Antoine Rocher,Behnood Bandi,Johan Richard,Boudewijn Roukema,Jon Loveday,Elmo Tempel,Maciej Bilicki,Jean-Paul Kneib,Mathilde Guitton*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 4MOST-CRS将测量南半球5700平方度的星系和类星体红移，通过亮星系和红星系样本，结合DESI数据，提供精确的BAO和结构增长测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究星系和类星体的红移分布，以改进宇宙学模型，特别是BAO和结构增长的测量。

Method: 选择亮星系和红星系样本，利用Gaia和Tycho-2星表进行星-星系分离，结合DESI数据验证样本纯净度。

Result: 样本恒星污染率低于2-4%，BAO和σ8测量精度分别为3%和25%，与DESI结合后约束提升12%。

Conclusion: 4MOST-CRS样本纯净且有效，结合DESI数据可显著提升宇宙学测量精度。

Abstract: The Cosmology Redshift Survey of the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic
Telescope (4MOST-CRS) will provide redshift measurements of galaxies and
quasars over 5700{\degsq} in the southern hemisphere. As targets for the
4MOST-CRS, we present a selection of an $r<19.25$ magnitude limited sample of
Bright Galaxies (BG) and a colour selected sample of Luminous Red Galaxies
(LRG) based on DESI Legacy Survey DR10.1 photometric data, in the redshift
ranges $0.1<z<0.5$ and $0.4<z<1$, respectively. These samples are selected
using the $g$, $r$, $z$, and $W1$ (from unWISE) photometric bands. For BGs, the
star--galaxy separation is performed based on Gaia and Tycho-2 star catalogues.
Following 4MOST requirements, the target densities of BGs and LRGs are
250{\mdegsq} and 400{\mdegsq}, respectively. We quantified the stellar
contamination to be $<2-4\%$ for both galaxy samples using data from the first
DESI data release. Using angular clustering, we show that both samples are
robust against imaging systematics, confirming a low stellar contamination.
Finally, we provide forecasts of the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) and
growth of structure ($\sigma_8$) measurements from the 4MOST-CRS alone and in
combination with DESI. From the 4MOST-CRS, we expect 3\% and 25\% precision on
BAO and $\sigma_8$ measurements, respectively. Combining 4MOST-CRS with DESI
improves the constraints from DESI alone by 12$\%$ in the 0.4 < z < 0.8
redshift range, leading to the most stringent constraints on BAO measurements
from spectroscopic galaxy clustering.

### [6] [Signature of polarized ultralight vector dark matter in pulsar timing arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07358)
*Kimihiro Nomura,Hidetoshi Omiya,Takahiro Tanaka*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 研究超轻矢量暗物质在脉冲星计时阵列中的观测特征，发现其产生的计时残差具有方向依赖性，可用于区分引力波和暗物质贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索矢量暗物质与标量暗物质的不同观测特征，以揭示暗物质的性质。

Method: 分析矢量暗物质在脉冲星计时阵列中的计时残差及其角相关曲线。

Result: 矢量暗物质导致计时残差具有方向依赖性，圆偏振增强四极性质，显著弯曲Hellings-Downs曲线。

Conclusion: 角相关曲线为区分引力波和暗物质贡献提供了有效手段，有助于探测暗物质性质。

Abstract: We investigate observational signatures of ultralight vector dark matter with
masses $m \sim 10^{-24}$-$10^{-22}$ eV in pulsar timing arrays, taking into
account general polarization states of the vector field. We find that vector
dark matter induces pulsar timing residuals with nontrivial directional
dependence, reflecting the anisotropic property and polarization structure
specific to vector dark matter, unlike scalar dark matter. We also derive
angular correlation curves of the timing residuals. Intriguingly, circular
polarization of the vector dark matter enhances the quadrupole nature of the
correlation curve, resulting in a more notable bending of the Hellings-Downs
curve. The derived correlation curves offer a useful means to distinguish
gravitational wave and dark matter contributions and to probe the nature of
dark matter.

### [7] [Rescattering of non-minimal coupling scalar particles during inflation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07381)
*Zhe Yu,Xunliang Yang,Yungui Gong*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 研究了非最小耦合标量粒子在暴胀期间突然产生时的再散射效应，发现耦合项显著增强了粒子产生，导致原初曲率扰动功率谱在特定尺度上增强，并产生显著的非高斯特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索非最小耦合标量粒子在暴胀期间的再散射效应及其对原初扰动的影响。

Method: 通过分析耦合项ξRχ²对粒子产生的增强作用，研究χ粒子与暴胀凝聚态ϕ的再散射过程。

Result: 功率谱在小尺度上可达O(10⁻²)，并发现显著的等边双谱非高斯特征。

Conclusion: 非最小耦合标量粒子的再散射效应显著影响原初扰动的功率谱和非高斯性。

Abstract: We investigate the rescattering effects arising from non-minimally coupled
scalar particles $\chi$ that are suddenly produced during inflation. The
coupling term $\xi R \chi^2$ significantly enhances resonant particle
production compared to minimal coupling scenarios. Consequently, the produced
$\chi$ particles rescattering off the homogeneous inflaton condensate $\phi$,
generating abundant $\delta\phi$ quanta within very short time intervals. This
process leads to characteristic enhancements in the power spectrum of
primordial curvature perturbations at scales corresponding to the moments of
particle production. When this occurs at small scales, the power spectrum
amplitude can reach as high as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$. Furthermore, analysis of
the equilateral bispectrum shows that this mechanism also induces substantial
non-Gaussian features.

### [8] [Preheating and gravitational waves in large-field hilltop inflation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07442)
*Diganta Das,Shreyas Revankar*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 论文分析了宇宙微波背景观测数据对暴胀势模型的约束，研究了预加热和引力波在暴胀后的行为，发现波动模式未显著增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨暴胀势模型的约束以及预加热和引力波在暴胀后的行为，以验证理论预测。

Method: 使用线性扰动理论和晶格模拟分析波动模式的增长和引力波背景。

Result: 波动模式未显著增长，引力波背景低于当前观测限。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明波动模式未经历不稳定增长，引力波背景未超出观测限。

Abstract: The combined Planck, BICEP/Keck Array and BAO measurements of the scalar
spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio from the cosmic microwave
background observations severely constrain or completely rule out several
models of inflationary potentials. On the other hand, the data seems to favor
concave potentials over convex ones. In this paper, we study preheating and
gravitational waves after inflation in a large-field, regularized hilltop
potential where inflation takes place in the concave plateau. The inflaton,
$\phi$, is coupled to a subdominant scalar field, $\chi$, through a quartic
coupling. After inflation ends, $\phi$ oscillates about the potential minimum
and becomes inhomogeneous. The growth of the fluctuation modes, $\delta\phi_k$
and $\delta\chi_k$, in a homogeneous, oscillating background is analyzed in
linear perturbation theory, revealing that small modes likely experience broad
self-resonance or external parametric resonance. To determine if the resonances
are sufficiently strong to cause unstable growth of the modes we perform a
lattice simulation. The lattice simulations demonstrate that, although the
initial inhomogeneities generate a stochastic gravitational wave background
that remains below the present observational limit, the fluctuations do not
grow exponentially, and the occupation numbers of $\delta\phi_k$ and
$\delta\chi_k$ remain close to zero.

### [9] [The Filament Rift: $Λ$CDM's Structural Challenge Against Observation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07480)
*Saeed Tavasoli,Parsa Ghafour*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 该研究首次比较了SDSS DR10观测和IllustrisTNG300-1模拟中的宇宙细丝，发现观测与模拟在细丝密度和星系演化方面存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ΛCDM模型对宇宙细丝的预测与观测数据之间的差异，以验证当前对大尺度结构及其对星系演化影响的理解。

Method: 使用GrAviPaSt方法识别细丝，分析宏细丝和微细丝的长度、厚度和质量密度对比，并比较观测与模拟的结果。

Result: 观测中的细丝密度普遍高于模拟，且星系演化特征（如恒星形成率）在观测和模拟中表现不同。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了ΛCDM模型与观测数据之间的不一致性，表明当前对大尺度结构的理解可能存在不足。

Abstract: This study presents the first extended comparison of cosmic filaments
identified in SDSS DR10 observations ($z < 0.05$) and the IllustrisTNG300-1
$\Lambda$CDM simulation ($z = 0$), utilizing the novel GrAviPaSt
filament-finder method. The analyses are performed on both macro- and
micro-filaments, each characterized by their length, thickness, and contrast in
mass density. In addition to total sample comparisons, two subcategories of
micro-filaments, GG (linking galaxy groups) and CC (linking galaxy clusters),
are introduced to further analyze discrepancies between the $\Lambda$CDM model
and observation. While $\Lambda$CDM produces extended macro-filaments, such
structures are largely absent in SDSS, and where present, they exhibit higher
densities than their simulated counterparts. Micro-filaments also show notable
density discrepancies: at fixed length and thickness, observational filaments
are significantly denser than those in the simulation. Employing radial density
profiles reveal that micro-filaments in the $\Lambda$CDM simulation exhibit
higher contrasts in mass density relative to the background compared to their
observational counterparts. Notably, CC type micro-filaments displayed enhanced
density contrasts over GG types in the simulation, while observational data
showed the opposite trend. Furthermore, SDSS galaxies in both GG and CC
micro-filaments exhibit lower specific star formation rates (sSFR) and older
stellar populations, while TNG300-1 micro-filaments host more actively
star-forming galaxies within the intermediate stellar mass range. These results
reveal persistent discrepancies between observational data and the $\Lambda$CDM
reconstruction of cosmic filaments, pointing to possible tensions in our
current understanding of large-scale structures and their environmental effects
on galaxy evolution.

### [10] [Abundance and Phase-Space Distribution of Subhalos in Cosmological N-body Simulations: Testing Numerical Convergence and Correction Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07678)
*Kun Xu*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 研究了子晕在数值模拟中的收敛性及校正方法，发现通过引入孤儿子晕可提高精度，但小尺度收敛仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 子晕对星系形成和宇宙学探测至关重要，但其数值模拟收敛性难以实现，尤其是在宿主晕内部。

Method: 使用两种不同质量分辨率的宇宙学N体模拟（Jiutian-300和Jiutian-1G），通过HBT+识别子晕，并分析孤儿子晕的影响。

Result: SPMF在5000粒子以上收敛，孤儿子晕可恢复真实空间分布和速度分布至5-10%精度，但红移空间统计仍受小尺度影响。

Conclusion: 建议在红移空间统计中使用对小尺度分离不敏感的方法，并需进一步改进孤儿子晕模型以实现更小尺度的收敛。

Abstract: Subhalos play a crucial role in accurately modeling galaxy formation and
galaxy-based cosmological probes within the highly nonlinear, virialized
regime. However, numerical convergence of subhalo evolution is difficult to
achieve, especially in the inner regions of host halos where tidal forces are
strongest. I investigate the numerical convergence and correction methods for
the abundance, spatial, and velocity distributions of subhalos using two
$6144^3$-particle cosmological N-body simulations with different mass
resolutions -- Jiutian-300 ($1.0 \times 10^{7}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$) and
Jiutian-1G ($3.7 \times 10^{8}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$) -- with subhalos identified
by HBT+. My study shows that the Surviving subhalo Peak Mass Function (SPMF)
converges only for subhalos with $m_{\mathrm{peak}}$ above $5000$ particles but
can be accurately recovered by including orphan subhalos that survive according
to the merger timescale model of Jiang et al., which outperforms other models.
Including orphan subhalos also enables recovery of the real-space spatial and
velocity distributions to $5$--$10\%$ accuracy down to scales of
$0.1$--$0.2\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. The remaining differences are likely due to
cosmic variance and finite-box effects in the smaller Jiutian-300 simulation.
Convergence below $0.1\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ remains challenging and requires
more sophisticated modeling of orphan subhalos. I further highlight that
redshift-space multipoles are more difficult to recover even at larger scales
because unreliable small-scale pairs at $r_{\mathrm{p}} <
0.1\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ in real space affect scales of tens of $\mathrm{Mpc}$
in redshift space due to elongated Fingers-of-God effects. Therefore, for
redshift-space statistics, I recommend using modified or alternative measures
that reduce sensitivity to small projected separations in subhalo-based
studies.

### [11] [The Blooming Tree Algorithm at Work: Clusters, Filaments and Superclusters in the Field of A2029](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07828)
*Heng Yu,Antonaldo Diaferio*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: BT算法通过层次聚类方法识别星系红移调查中的集群、群组和子结构，成功应用于A2029星系团数据，揭示了超星系团的层次结构和演化历史。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究宇宙结构的形成与演化，尤其是在非线性和轻度非线性尺度上，需要一种有效的工具来识别和分析星系团、群组及其子结构。

Method: 基于层次聚类方法的BT算法，通过降低检测阈值识别超星系团，并根据成对结合能构建层次树。

Result: BT算法成功识别了所有X射线明亮集群、多数光学集群、群组和周围纤维结构，并揭示了三个超星系团的层次结构和演化历史。

Conclusion: BT算法是研究宇宙结构形成与演化的重要工具，尤其在非线性和轻度非线性尺度上表现优异。

Abstract: The Blooming Tree (BT) algorithm, based on the hierarchical clustering
method, is designed to identify clusters, groups, and substructures from galaxy
redshift surveys. We apply the BT algorithm to a wide-field ($10\times 10$
deg$^2$) spectroscopic dataset centered on the galaxy cluster A2029. The BT
algorithm effectively identifies all the X-ray luminous clusters and most of
the optical clusters known in the literature, numerous groups, and the
filaments surrounding the clusters, associating a list of galaxy members to
each structure. By lowering the detection threshold, the BT algorithm also
identifies the three superclusters in the field. The BT algorithm arranges the
clusters and groups that make up the superclusters in a hierarchical tree
according to their pairwise binding energy: the algorithm thus unveils the
possible accretion history of each supercluster and their future evolution.
These results show how the BT algorithm can represent a crucial tool to
investigate the formation and evolution of cosmic structures on non-linear and
mildly non-linear scales.

### [12] [Probing gravity beyond general relativity with bispectrum multipoles of cosmological tracers: I. Theoretical Foundations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07990)

Motivation: 通过双谱的非高斯性和模式耦合特性，探测修正引力理论（如DHOST）与广义相对论的偏差。

Method: 分析红移空间双谱的所有非零角多极子$B_l^m$，研究其对不同三角形配置的敏感性。

Result: 高阶多极子（$l=2,4,6$）对修正引力的敏感性更高，且符号变化可作为偏差指示；$l=6$多极子不受二次偏置影响。

Conclusion: 红移空间双谱的高阶多极子是探测修正引力的有效工具，尤其是$l=6$多极子，因其不受某些偏置影响。

Abstract: The bispectrum, being sensitive to non-Gaussianity and mode coupling of
cosmological fields induced by non-linear gravitational evolution, serves as a
powerful probe for detecting deviations from General Relativity (GR). The
signatures of modified gravity in the bispectrum are even more pronounced in
redshift space, where anisotropies from peculiar velocities provide unbiased
information on higher-order properties of gravity. We investigate the potential
of all non-zero angular multipoles $B_l^m$ of redshift space bispectrum across
all possible triangle configurations to probe degenerate higher-order scalar
tensor (DHOST) theory. We show that the higher-order multipoles of the
bispectrum with $l=2,4,6$ are more sensitive to the modifications in gravity
than the spherically averaged monopole moment $l=0$. These multipoles
demonstrate remarkable sensitivity to the higher-order growth history, which
varies across triangle configurations, with acute triangles generally being the
most sensitive to modification in GR. The values of various multipoles exhibit
opposite signs in modified gravity compared to those predicted in GR, which
serves as a robust indicator of the deviation from GR. We demonstrate that,
unlike $l=2$ and $4$ multipoles, the $l=6$ multipoles with $m\leq 4$ are not
affected by the quadratic bias and second-order tidal bias parameters,
emphasising the need to leverage their capabilities in analyses. The $(l=6, m >
4)$ multipoles fail to capture the second-order growth, while all $l=8$
multipoles lack any independent information regarding modified gravity in both
linear and nonlinear regimes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索一种通用的哈勃函数参数化方法，以涵盖多种宇宙学模型，避免直接参数化暗成分。

Method: 使用哈勃参数测量、三种Ia型超新星数据（Pantheon+、DESY5、Union3）及重子声学振荡数据（SDSS和DESI）对模型进行约束。

Result: 结果显示与标准ΛCDM模型存在轻微偏差，模型在热力学上一致且在模型比较测试中表现良好。

Conclusion: 该参数化方法具有广泛适用性，且在观测数据中表现出色，为宇宙学研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: In the present article, we propose a very simple parametrization of the
Hubble function without parametrizing the dark components of the Universe. One
of the novelties of the parametrization is that it may include a wide variety
of the cosmological models, such as dark energy (both noninteracting and
interacting fluids), modified gravity, cosmological matter creation and other
known scenarios. The model is constrained with the latest astronomical probes
from Hubble parameter measurements, three distinct versions of Type Ia
Supernovae (Pantheon+, DESY5, Union3) and baryon acoustic oscillations from
Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument data releases
1 and 2. Our results suggest a mild deviation from the standard $\Lambda$CDM
cosmological model for most of the combined datasets. We also find that our
model is thermodynamically consistent and performs well in the model comparison
tests.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为cross-GPR的方法，用于从低频射电望远镜数据中分离21厘米信号与不相关的系统误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前低频射电望远镜在探测21厘米信号时，受限于系统误差和快速频率波动的污染物，标准方法难以有效分离这些干扰。

Method: 开发了cross-GPR方法，利用系统误差在多个观测夜晚中的不相关性，将其与21厘米信号分离。

Conclusion: cross-GPR方法能有效减少不相关干扰，同时保留21厘米信号，为21厘米宇宙学提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Systematic effects that limit the achievable sensitivity of current
low-frequency radio telescopes to the 21-cm signal are among the foremost
challenges in observational 21-cm cosmology. The standard approach to
retrieving the 21-cm signal from radio interferometric data separates it from
bright astrophysical foregrounds by exploiting their spectrally smooth nature,
in contrast to the finer spectral structure of the 21-cm signal. Contaminants
exhibiting rapid frequency fluctuations, on the other hand, are difficult to
separate from the 21-cm signal using standard techniques, and the power from
these contaminants contributes to low-level systematics that can limit our
ability to detect the 21-cm signal. Many of these low-level systematics are
incoherent across multiple nights of observation, resulting in an incoherent
excess variance above the thermal noise sensitivity of the instrument. In this
paper, we develop a method called cross-GPR (cross covariance Gaussian process
regression) that exploits the incoherence of these systematics to separate them
from the 21-cm signal, which remains coherent across multiple nights of
observation. We first develop and demonstrate the technique on synthetic
signals in a general setting, and then apply it to gridded interferometric
visibility cubes. We perform realistic simulations of visibility cubes
containing foregrounds, 21-cm signal, noise, and incoherent systematics. The
simulations show that the method can successfully separate and subtract
incoherent contributions to the excess variance, and its advantages over
standard techniques become more evident when the spectral behavior of the
contaminants resembles that of the 21-cm signal. Simulations performed on a
variety of 21-cm signal shapes also reveal that the cross-GPR approach can
subtract incoherent contributions to the excess variance, without suppressing
the 21-cm signal.

Motivation: 探讨超大质量原初黑洞（PBHs）是否可作为暗物质的主要成分。

Method: 分析PBHs产生的等曲率扰动，并与普朗克卫星的宇宙微波背景观测数据对比。

TL;DR: 研究探讨了射电干涉仪在预再电离时代21厘米信号中识别空间不均匀暗物质湮灭印记的敏感性，使用CNN分析模拟数据，发现电子-正电子对湮灭通道下CNN能有效区分不均匀与均匀模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索暗物质湮灭对21厘米信号的影响，特别是空间不均匀性如何通过下一代射电干涉仪（如SKA-Low）被检测。

Method: 使用CNN分析基于DM21cm代码生成的模拟3D 21厘米亮度温度图，对比均匀与非均匀能量注入模型。

Result: 电子-正电子对湮灭通道下CNN能有效区分不均匀与均匀模型，光子湮灭通道区分度较低。不均匀模型在特定暗物质质量和湮灭截面下可被检测。

Conclusion: 不均匀暗物质湮灭模型可在21厘米信号中留下可检测的印记，尤其在电子-正电子对湮灭通道下，为未来观测提供可能。

Abstract: This study investigates the sensitivity of the radio interferometers to
identify imprints of spatially inhomogeneous dark matter annihilation
signatures in the 21-cm signal during the pre-reionization era. We focus on the
upcoming low-mode survey of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA-Low) telescope.
Using CNNs, we analyze simulated 3D 21-cm differential brightness temperature
maps generated via the DM21cm code, which is based on 21cmFAST and DarkHistory,
to distinguish between spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous energy
injection/deposition scenarios arising from dark matter annihilation. The
inhomogeneous case accounts for local dark matter density contrasts and gas
properties, such as thermal and ionization states, while the homogeneous model
assumes uniform energy deposition. Our study focuses on two primary
annihilation channels to electron-positron pairs ($e^+e^-$) and photons (
$\gamma \gamma$), exploring dark matter masses from 1 MeV to 100 MeV and a
range of annihilation cross-sections. For $\gamma \gamma$ channel, the
distinction across dark matter models is less pronounced due to the larger mean
free path of the emitted photons, resulting in a more uniform energy
deposition. For $e^+e^-$ channel, the results indicate that the CNNs can
effectively differentiate between the inhomogeneous and homogeneous cases.
Despite observational challenges, the results demonstrate that these effects
remain detectable even after incorporating noise from next-generation radio
interferometers, such as the SKA. We find that the inhomogeneous dark matter
annihilation models can leave measurable imprints on the 21-cm signal maps
distinguishable from the homogeneous scenarios for the dark matter masses
$m_{\rm DM}=1$ MeV and the annihilation cross-sections of $\geq 5 \times
10^{-30}~{\rm cm^3/sec}$ ($\geq 5 \times 10^{-29}~{\rm cm^3/sec}$ for $m_{\rm
DM}=100$ MeV) for moderate SKA-Low noise.

*Stella Menziltsidou*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Teukolsky理论和物理信息神经网络（PINN）的混合方法，用于精确测量黑洞自旋，优于传统和数据驱动方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑洞自旋测量方法（如连续谱拟合、X射线反射光谱等）在准确性、可解释性和扩展性方面存在局限。

Method: 开发了基于Teukolsky理论的PINN模型，通过嵌入物理约束训练，无需标注数据，直接使用微分算子和边界条件监督。

Result: PINN收敛可靠，残差损失低于10，RMSE达$10^{-7}$，在AUC和灵敏度上优于传统方法，且计算成本适中。

Conclusion: 物理驱动的机器学习为黑洞自旋估计提供了准确、可解释的框架，未来可结合GRMHD求解器应用于实际观测数据。

Abstract: The measurement of black hole spin is considered one of the key problems in
relativistic astrophysics. Existing methods, such as continuum fitting, X-ray
reflection spectroscopy, and quasi-periodic oscillation analysis, suffer from
limitations in accuracy, interpretability, and scalability. In this work, a
hybrid approach is proposed in which theoretical models based on the Teukolsky
formalism are integrated with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). A PINN
model is developed to solve the linearized spin problem in the scalar case,
with physical constraints directly embedded into the training process.
Annotated data are not required; instead, the model is trained using the
differential operator and boundary conditions as supervision. It is
demonstrated that the PINN converges reliably, with residual loss values below
10 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) on the order of $10^{-7}$. Benchmarking
results indicate that the proposed method outperforms both classical and
data-driven machine learning approaches in terms of AUC and sensitivity, while
also exhibiting superior interpretability, generalizability, and adherence to
physical principles, with moderate computational cost. Potential extensions
include integration with general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD)
solvers and application to real observational data. These findings support the
viability of physics-based machine learning as a robust framework for accurate
and interpretable black hole spin estimation.

Method: 利用ZTF五年的光变曲线，分析变异性与黑洞质量、X射线和射电特性的相关性。

Result: 发现变异性时间尺度与黑洞质量和光度正相关，但与X射线特性无关，射电特性影响微弱。

Conclusion: AGN长期光学变异性主要由吸积盘热辐射主导，需更大样本进一步验证。

Abstract: We study the optical variability characteristics of Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN) from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) AGN catalogue by utilising
approximately five years of optical light curves from the Zwicky Transient
Facility (ZTF) survey. We investigate dependencies of the long-term optical
variability amplitudes and timescales on (i) supermassive black hole (SMBH)
mass, luminosity, and Eddington ratio to explore the influence of accretion
disk dynamics and radiative processes; (ii) X-ray properties, such as spectral
photon indices and fluxes, to study the effect of high-energy emission
mechanisms; and (iii) radio characteristics, such as integrated fluxes and
radio loudness, which indicate jet activity. Our findings confirm a positive
correlation between the variability time scale and both the SMBH mass and
luminosity, suggesting that these physical parameters significantly impact the
optical variability timescale. Conversely, no significant dependence is found
between optical variability and X-ray properties, indicating that high-energy
processes may not substantially influence long-term optical variability.
Additionally, a weak anti-correlation between optical variability and radio
parameters suggests that jet activity has a negligible effect on causing
long-term AGN variability. These results support the hypothesis that long-term
optical variability in AGN is primarily governed by thermal emission from the
accretion disk. Further investigations with larger samples are essential to
refine these correlations and develop robust physical models integrating black
hole properties, accretion disk physics, and multi-wavelength radiative
transfer.

Abstract: Gravitational lensing of short astrophysical transients provides a uniquely
direct avenue for searching for primordial black holes (PBHs) across a vast
range of masses. While past search efforts have focused on particular source
classes-such as fast radio bursts (FRBs) and gamma-ray burst spikes-no
systematic, multi-wavelength survey has compared their relative potential for
PBH discovery. We present here a broad assessment of transient lensing search
opportunities, spanning more than twenty decades in photon frequency and over
twelve orders of magnitude in PBH mass. For each class, we determine the
accessible PBH mass window by accounting for wave-optics suppression and
time-delay resolution limits, and we estimate potential sensitivities to the
PBH abundance using representative event rates, distances, and optical depths.
Our survey includes low-frequency radio events (FRBs, pulsar giant pulses,
planetary cyclotron bursts), optical/infrared signals, and high-energy
phenomena (gamma-ray burst spikes, fast X-ray transients, TeV blazar flares).
We synthesize these results in a unified mass-abundance diagram and
comprehensive tables summarizing both physical reach and observational
requirements. This work serves as a roadmap for optimizing future
multi-wavelength lensing searches, guiding the design of instruments and
strategies to explore the PBH dark matter hypothesis across its remaining
viable parameter space.

Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) offer a unique environment for discovering and
studying millisecond pulsars. In this paper, we present a multi-epoch search
and detailed timing analysis of millisecond pulsars in the GC M2, using the
Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope. We have discovered two new
binary millisecond pulsars in M2, designated M2F and M2G, respectively. We
provide measurements of the emission properties of all known pulsars in M2,
including their polarization profiles, rotation measures, flux densities,
scintillation characteristics, and so forth. In particular, we report the first
rotation measure at the distance and direction of this cluster. Additionally,
we report the first phase-coherent timing solutions for the M2 pulsars. From
our Bayesian timing analysis, we have measured their spin and orbital
parameters with high precision, including the advance of periastron for M2A and
M2E indicating total system masses of 1.75(13) and 1.80(5) solar masses
respectively. Using archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope, we have
identified an optical counterpart of M2C, which is likely the white dwarf
companion of the pulsar. By combining results from optical and radio
observations, we have reconstructed the binary evolution track of this system
and estimated the cooling age of the companion to be approximately 10\,Myr,
making it the youngest white dwarf in any known GC binary pulsars. Furthermore,
using the spin period derivatives of M2 pulsars, we have investigated the
gravitational potential of the cluster and found that our results strongly
support the latest central-stellar-velocity dispersion measurement in M2.

Motivation: GRB的明亮瞬时光学发射机制尚不明确，研究旨在通过结构化喷流模型解释这一现象。

Method: 假设GRB喷流为结构化喷流，核心为超相对论性均匀喷流，周围为温和相对论性茧。MJC区域通过剪切加速机制加速粒子，并假设均匀磁场配置，计算同步辐射和自同步康普顿（SSC）过程。

Result: 模型成功解释了GRB 990123、080319B和130427A的明亮光学闪和光谱特征，推断MJC区域的磁场强度超过10^5 G。

Conclusion: 研究支持GRB喷流高度磁化的假设，MJC模型为GRB光学闪和X射线/MeV-GeV伽马射线闪光提供了合理解释。

Abstract: The radiation physics of bright prompt optical emission of gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) remains a puzzle. Assuming that the GRB ejecta is structured, we
investigated this issue by characterizing the ejecta as an ultra-relativistic
uniform jet core surrounded by a mild-relativistic cocoon. The mixed jet-cocoon
(MJC) region can accelerate particles through the shear acceleration mechanism.
Parameterizing the radial velocity profile of the MJC region with an
exponential function and assuming a uniform magnetic field configuration, we
show that the synchrotron radiation of the shear-accelerated electrons can
produce a bright optical flash. Emission of the self-synchrotron Compton (SSC)
process of the electron population can result in an X-ray excess and an extra
MeV-GeV gamma-ray flash relative to the Band function component in the keV-MeV
band, which is attributed to the synchrotron radiation of the shock-accelerated
electrons in the jet core. Our model reasonably represents the extremely bright
optical flash and spectral characteristics of GRBs 990123, 080319B, and
130427A. The inferred magnetic field strength of the MJC region is above
$10^{5}$ G, potentially suggesting that the jets of these GRBs are highly
magnetized.

Motivation: 探索脉冲星J0311+1402在111 MHz频率下的辐射特性，特别是其间歇性辐射行为。

Method: 利用大型相控阵（LPA）射电望远镜的存档数据，采用快速折叠算法（FFA）搜索脉冲信号，并对强脉冲进行分析。

Result: 未检测到周期性辐射，但发现35个强脉冲，部分具有多峰结构；脉冲星表现出类似RRAT的间歇性辐射特性，并具有已知脉冲星中最小的色散量、距离和伪光度。

Conclusion: 脉冲星J0311+1402的辐射行为与RRAT相似，其周期和周期导数的测量得到了改进。

Abstract: A search has been carried out for the pulsar J0311+1402, which has a period
of $P = 40.9$ s, in the data archive of the Large Phased Array (LPA) radio
telescope. When searching using fast folding algorithm (FFA), periodic pulsar
radiation at a frequency of 111 MHz was not detected. In 3321 observation
sessions lasting 5 minutes, 35 strong pulses were detected with a
signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) greater than 10. Some of the pulses have a complex
multi-peak structure consisting of narrow details, while some of the pulses are
single-component. The peak flux densities of the details of these strong pulses
range from 2 to 11 Jy. The peak value ($S_{\rm p} = 2$\,Jy) and the integral
($S_{\rm i} = 7$\,mJy) flux density in the average profile were obtained from
the strong pulses. It is shown that pulsar pulses in the meter-wavelength range
arrive sporadically, and the pulsar is similar in its properties to a rotating
radio transient (RRAT). The pulsar has the minimal dispersion measure, the
minimal distance from the Sun, and the minimal pseudo-luminosity of all known
pulsars. Pulsar timing made it possible to improve the previously obtained
value of the period ($P$) and to estimate the period derivative ($\dot P$). In
the dependency of timing residuals (TRs) from the times of arrival (TOA) of
pulses discontinuities are visible, when no pulses were observed. The duration
of these breaks can be hundreds of days.

Abstract: The hadron production in the simulation of extensive air showers is a long
standing problem and the origin of large uncertainties in the reconstruction of
the mass of the high energy primary cosmic rays. Hadronic interaction models
re-tuned after early LHC data give more consistent results among each other
compared to the first generation of models, but still can't reproduce extended
air shower data (EAS) consistently resulting in the so-called "muon puzzle".
Using more recent LHC data like in the QGSJET-III model improve further the
description of EAS by such a model but is not enough to resolve the
discrepancy. On the other hand, the EPOS project is a theoretical global
approach aiming at describing data from very fundamental electron-positron
interactions to central heavy ions collisions. We will demonstrate that this
approach can provide new constraints, changing the correlation between the
measured data at mid-rapidity and the predicted particle production at large
rapidities, which drive the EAS development. Thus, using the same accelerator
data, different predictions are obtained in air shower simulations in much
better agreement with the current air shower data (for both the maximum shower
development depth Xmax and the energy spectrum of the muons at ground). Using
the EPOS LHC-R model, the detailed changes will be addressed and their
consequences on EAS observable at various energies.

Motivation: 解释为何300 TeV光子未被背景光吸收且延迟探测，需新物理或天体机制。

Method: 假设300 TeV光子是LHAASO探测的TeV余辉部分，研究LIV参数空间，分析LIV能量尺度。

Result: 一阶LIV与观测不符，二阶LIV（$E_{\rm LIV2} = 1.30_{-0.35}^{+0.56} \times 10^{-7} E_{\rm Pl}$）与数据一致。

Conclusion: LIV（特别是二阶）可解释观测现象，为量子引力理论提供约束。

Abstract: The air shower array Carpet-3 detected a 300 TeV photon from the direction of
GRB 221009A at 4536 s after the Fermi-GBM trigger for this event. If the
association with this gamma-ray burst is real, it poses two puzzles. First, why
was this photon not absorbed by the extragalactic background light? ``New
physics'' beyond the Standard Model is required to explain how it managed to
reach Earth from a cosmological distance. Second, why was this photon detected
when the VHE afterglow observed by LHAASO already faded? A novel astrophysical
mechanism is required to explain this delay. In this work we show that Lorentz
invariance violation (LIV), which arises as a low-energy limit of certain
quantum gravity theories, can solve both puzzles. It shifts thresholds of
particle interaction and changes the opacity of the extragalactic background,
and cause energy-dependent variations of the photon velocity, which changes the
photon time of flight. We investigate the LIV parameter space assuming that the
300 TeV photon is a part of the VHE afterglow detected by LHAASO in the TeV
range. We identify viable solutions and place stringent two-sided constraints
on the LIV energy scale required to resolve the observational puzzles.
First-order LIV appears to be incompatible with the constraints set by
analyzing the TeV afterglow of this GRB. Viable solutions emerge for higher
orders. In particular, the commonly studied second-order subluminal LIV with
$E_{\rm LIV2} = 1.30_{-0.35}^{+0.56} \times 10^{-7} E_{\rm Pl}$ (95.4%
credibility level; $E_{\rm Pl}$ is the Planck energy) is consistent with all
the observed data.

Abstract: We present the discovery of a correlation, in a sample of 16 gamma-ray burst
8.5 GHz radio afterglows, between the intrinsic luminosity measured at 10 days
in the rest frame, $L_{\mathrm{Radio,10d}}$, and the average rate of decay past
this time, $\alpha_{>10d}$. The correlation has a Spearman's rank coefficient
of $-0.70 \pm 0.13$ at a significance of $>3\sigma$ and a linear regression fit
of $\alpha_{>10d} = -0.29^{+0.19}_{-0.28} \log \left(L_{\mathrm{Radio,10d}}
\right) + 8.12^{+8.86}_{-5.88}$. This finding suggests that more luminous radio
afterglows have higher average rates of decay than less luminous ones. We use a
Monte Carlo simulation to show the correlation is not produced by chance or
selection effects at a confidence level of $>3\sigma$. Previous studies found
this relation in optical/UV, X-ray and GeV afterglow light curves, and we have
now extended it to radio light curves. The Spearman's rank coefficients and the
linear regression slopes for the correlation in each waveband are all
consistent within $1\sigma$. We discuss how these new results in the radio band
support the effects of observer viewing geometry, and time-varying
microphysical parameters, as possible causes of the correlation as suggested in
previous works.

Abstract: We analyzed X-ray data from Chandra, XMM-Newton, NICER, and NuSTAR to
characterize the properties of the pulsar PSR J1838$-$0655 and its pulsar wind
nebula (PWN) associated with HESS J1837$-$069. Based on 5.5 years of NICER
monitoring, we detected a glitch around MJD 59300, characterized by a
fractional frequency jump of approximately $2\times 10^{-6}$. We constructed
semi-phase-coherent timing solutions for pre- and post-glitch epochs, allowing
for phase alignment of multi-instrument data and a subsequent measurement of
the pulsed spectrum of the pulsar. This analysis confirmed previously-reported
spectral curvature and revealed a peak energy of $73^{+85}_{-26}$ keV in the
pulsar's spectral energy distribution (SED), based on a logpar model fit of the
pulsed spectrum. We discuss these findings within the framework of pulsar
magnetospheric emission scenarios. The PWN's X-ray spectrum is well-described
by a power law with a photon index of $2.1\pm0.3$, softer than
previously-reported measurements. We also characterized the X-ray emission from
another extended X-ray source AX J1837.3$-$0652 within the extent of HESS
J1837$-$069. Based on the spatial and spectral properties of these X-ray
sources, we propose a leptonic emission scenario for HESS J1837$-$069 and
demonstrate its feasibility through SED modeling. Finally, we discuss the
implications of our model results and alternative scenarios for the gamma-ray
emission.

Motivation: 通过研究FRB宿主星系的金属丰度，探索FRB起源的约束条件。

Method: 使用统一的发射线诊断方法测量40个宿主星系的氧丰度，并与恒星形成星系对照组进行比较。

Result: FRB宿主星系的金属丰度范围广，无明确下限，且与恒星形成星系的质量-金属丰度关系一致；发现金属丰度偏移可能与星系合并后的星暴后阶段有关。

Conclusion: FRB可在低金属丰度高红移星系中形成，支持其作为宇宙物质分布探针的潜力；FRB产生可能与双星演化通道相关。

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration extragalactic radio
transients of unknown origin, and studying their host galaxies could offer
clues to constrain progenitor models. Among various host properties, gas-phase
metallicity is a key factor influencing stellar evolution and the production of
transients. We analyze the largest uniformly selected sample of FRB host
galaxies to date, measuring oxygen abundances (12+log(O/H) = 8.04-8.84) for 40
hosts using consistent emission-line diagnostics. Using a volume-limited
subsample, we compare the distributions of stellar mass, star formation rate
(SFR), and metallicity to a control sample of star-forming galaxies matched in
the same selection criteria. We find that FRB host galaxies span a wide range
in metallicity and are broadly consistent with the SFR-weighted
mass-metallicity relation of the star-forming galaxy population. Contrary to
the earlier claim in the literature, we find no clear lower bound on
metallicity, suggesting that metallicity alone does not strictly regulate FRB
production. Encouragingly, this implies FRBs can form even in low-metallicity,
high-redshift galaxies, supporting their potential as probes of matter
distribution across cosmic time. Additionally, we find marginal
($\sim$2$\sigma$) evidence for a -0.09 $\pm$ 0.04 dex metallicity offset from
the fundamental metallicity relation, likely due to suppressed SFRs at fixed
mass and metallicity rather than metal deficiency. This offset resembles that
observed in local post-merger galaxies, and may reflect a post-starburst phase
following galaxy interactions, where FRB progenitors formed during the
starburst produce FRBs after a 100-500 Myr delay, consistent with observed
delay-time distributions and favoring binary evolution channels over
core-collapse supernovae.

### [29] [Revisiting Two Decades of GRB Observations: Assessing Missed Very High-Energy Detections and Future Prospects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07821)

Motivation: 探讨为何IACTs在2002年至2018年间未探测到GRBs的高能伽马射线，尽管理论预测其存在。

Method: 分析Swift观测站过去20年探测到的GRBs，结合X射线与伽马射线的现象学关系，考虑背景光吸收和仪器响应，筛选可能被H.E.S.S.、MAGIC和VERITAS探测的GRBs。

Result: 发现可探测的GRBs在高能伽马射线波段频率极低（<1次/年），未来CTA观测站可显著提升至4次/年。

Conclusion: IACTs未探测到GRBs的高能伽马射线是由于可探测率低，未来CTA观测站将大幅改善这一情况。

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are bright flashes of electromagnetic radiation
originating from the core collapse of massive stars or the merger of compact
objects. It has long been theorized that GRBs can emit very high-energy (VHE)
gamma rays that can reach the TeV level. Although current-generation Imaging
Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), such as H.E.S.S., have been observing
GRBs since 2002, the first detection of GRBs by IACTs occurred only 16 years
later, in 2018, raising the question of why no detections were made during
these years. We investigate all GRBs detected by the Swift Observatory with
redshift measurements over the past two decades. Using the phenomenological
relationship between X-ray and gamma rays and taking into consideration
extragalactic background light absorption effects and instrument response
functions, we search for any missed opportunities for GRBs that could have been
detected by the three IACTs: H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS, and present the best
candidates. We find that the missing detections can be explained by the low
rate of detectable GRBs at VHE, which we quantify as < 1 per year. We also find
that with the future Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), this rate
can increase to 4 per year.

Result: 发现光谱状态变化与截断盘运动相关，确认了QPO的存在，并观察到滞后现象的摆动。

Conclusion: 结果支持了关于吸积参数动态变化的理论，并与先前研究一致。

Abstract: We performed the spectral and temporal analysis of MAXI J1803-298 using
AstroSat/LAXPC and NICER observations taken in May 2021 during the initial
phase of the outburst. We found that the source traverses through the hard,
intermediate, and soft spectral states during the outburst. The spectrum in all
states can be described using soft emissions from the thermal disk and hard
emissions from the coronal regions. The variation in the inner disk temperature
and normalization of the disk indicates the motion of the truncated disk across
these different spectral states. We confirmed the presence of broad features,
Type-C, and Type-B QPOs in the power spectra of different spectral states. We
investigated the fractional rms and lags of all the variability features and
discovered that the lag swung between positive and negative during the outburst
evolution. While modeling the features with a simple model that considers
variations in accretion parameters such as the accretion rate, heating rate,
and inner disk radius, along with delays between them, we found a dynamic
reversal in the origin of variability between the corona and the disk.
Furthermore, our results are consistent with previous works and a radio study
conducted on this source during its outburst.

Abstract: This proceeding presents recent results from a joint analysis of
time-dependent neutrino and electromagnetic emissions from tidal disruption
events (TDEs), using both isotropic wind models and relativistic jets. We
discuss constraints from Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) $\gamma$-ray upper
limits on the size of the radiation zone and the maximum energies of
accelerated cosmic rays, as well as the resulting neutrino productions from
TDEs and candidates, including AT 2019dsg, AT 2019fdr, AT 2019aalc, and AT
2021lwx. The Fermi upper limits correspond to a generic neutrino detection rate
of $\lesssim0.01-0.1$ per TDE. Additionally, we explore multi-wavelength
modeling of jetted TDEs with luminous X-ray afterglows, another TDE subclass,
by incorporating the dynamics of structured jets with time-dependent energy
injection. We also examine the connection between neutrinos and their
multi-wavelength counterparts, highlighting implications for future
multi-messenger discoveries with IceCube, IceCube-Gen2, KM3NeT, and Fermi-LAT.

Result: QPE RX J1301.9+2747在轨道偏心率为0.25且质量超过35太阳质量时，可能被未来空间引力波探测器探测到。

Conclusion: QPEs的引力波信号信噪比足够高，可区分真空EMRIs，为QPEs起源和黑洞环境研究提供新途径。

Abstract: One prominent model for quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) is that they
originate from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) involving stellar-mass
objects orbiting around massive black holes and colliding with their accretion
disks. We compute the gravitational wave signals from such a model,
demonstrating that orbiter-disk interactions result in small frequency shifts
and high-frequency tails due to the excitation of non-discrete modes.
Interestingly, we show that QPE RX J1301.9+2747 could be detectable by future
space-based gravitational wave detectors, provided a moderate eccentricity
around $0.25$ and a mass exceeding $35\,M_\odot$ for the orbiter. Moreover,
based on this QPE model, we show that the signal-to-noise ratio of the
gravitational wave signals from QPEs, if detectable, will be sufficiently high
to distinguish such systems from vacuum EMRIs and shed light on the origin of
QPEs and environments around massive black holes.

Conclusion: 该框架灵活高效，适用于稳态和瞬态天体物理源的多信使信号建模，为粒子加速与辐射机制的结合提供了新见解。

Abstract: Turbulent coronae of supermassive black holes can accelerate non-thermal
particles to high energies and produce observable radiation, but capturing this
process is challenging due to comparable timescales of acceleration, cooling,
and the development of cascades. We present a time-dependent numerical
framework that self-consistently couples proton acceleration -- modeled by the
Fokker-Planck equation -- with leptonic-hadronic radiation. For the
neutrino-emitting Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, we reproduce the neutrino spectrum
observed by IceCube, while satisfying gamma-ray constraints. We also consider a
transient corona scenario, potentially emerging in non-jetted tidal disruption
events like AT 2019dsg, and show that early-stage cascade feedback can impact
proton acceleration and radiation processes in weaker coronae, producing
delayed optical/ultraviolet, X-ray, and neutrino emissions of $\mathcal
O(100~\rm d)$. This flexible code efficiently models multi-messenger signals
from both steady and transient astrophysical sources, providing insights in
combining particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms.

Motivation: 中子星通常具有强磁场，但磁场在双星系统中的演化及其对引力波的影响尚不明确。

Method: 采用微扰理论计算磁场相互作用和电磁辐射对引力波相位演化的影响。

Result: 强磁场（如$10^{14}$-$10^{15}$G）可在DECIGO和爱因斯坦望远镜中被探测到，极端磁场（$10^{16}$G）在第三代探测器中可能被探测到Gpc尺度。

Conclusion: 当前和未来的引力波探测器有望识别磁化双星系统。

Abstract: We study the imprint of magnetic fields on gravitational waves emitted during
the inspiral phase of eccentric binary neutron star systems. While observations
indicate that neutron stars typically exhibit strong magnetic fields in the
range of $10^{14}$-$10^{15}\,\mathrm{G}$, theoretical models allow for fields
as high as $ \sim 10^{17-18}\,\mathrm{G}$. In binaries, the fate of these
fields depends on the formation pathway: in systems formed through isolated
evolution, magnetic fields may decay over long inspiral timescales. In
contrast, binaries formed via dynamical capture can retain substantial
eccentricity and strong fields until merger, potentially altering the
gravitational waveform. We consider two magnetic effects: magnetic interaction
between the neutron stars and electromagnetic radiation from the system's
effective dipole, and identify regimes where each dominates. Using a
perturbative framework, we compute the associated energy loss and gravitational
wave phase evolution. We find that for binaries with strong and comparable
magnetic fields, $10^{14}\,\mathrm{G}$ fields may be detectable up to $\sim 10
\, \mathrm{Mpc}$ with DECIGO and the Einstein Telescope, while
$10^{15}\,\mathrm{G}$ fields extend the reach to several hundred Mpc. For
extreme fields of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{G}$, third-generation detectors could be
sensitive out to Gpc scales. In contrast, LIGO is limited to galactic
distances: $10^{15}\,\mathrm{G}$ fields are detectable only within $\sim
100\,\mathrm{kpc}$, and only ultrastrong fields ($\sim
10^{16}$-$10^{17}\,\mathrm{G}$) are potentially observable at Gpc distances. In
highly asymmetric systems, where dipole radiation dominates, the gravitational
wave dephasing is significantly suppressed, reducing the detection horizon.
These findings suggest that current and future gravitational wave observatories
may be capable of identifying magnetized binary systems.

Such objects are expected from\nstandard hierarchical galaxy evolution to form after two galaxies, each\ncontaining a supermassive black hole, have merged, in the centre of the merger\nremnant. A complex interaction is predicted to take place with stars and gas in\nthe host galaxy, leading to observable signatures in weakly as well as actively\naccreting phases. Direct observational evidence is available and shows examples\nof dual active galactic nuclei from kpc scales down to parsec scales.\nSignatures of possibly closer supermassive black hole binaries may be seen in\njetted black holes. The interaction with stars and gas in a galaxy\nsignificantly affects the hardening of the binary and hence contributes to\nuncertainties of the expected gravitational wave signal. The Laser\nInterferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should in the future detect actual mergers.\nBefore the launch of LISA, pulsar timing arrays may have the best chance to\ndetect a gravitational wave signal from supermassive black hole binaries.

Most studies employ absorption\nline spectroscopy that only gives us a single sightline through the wind\nstreamlines. Hercules X-1 is a peculiar X-ray binary which allows us to avoid\nthis issue, as its warped, precessing accretion disk naturally presents a range\nof sightlines through the vertical structure of its disk wind. Here we present\nthe first results from a large, coordinated campaign on Her X-1 led by the new\nXRISM observatory and supported by XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and Chandra. We perform a\ntime-resolved analysis and constrain the properties of the wind vertical\nstructure.

The wind\ncolumn density decreases with height, as expected, but its ionization parameter\nonly evolves weakly, and is consistent with freezing out as the wind expands\naway.

Using 18 X-ray/B-band simultaneous XMM-Newton observations (717\nks in total) of the redback system PSR J1023+0038 taken during the LMXB state,\nwe find a general trend that the amplitude of the B-band orbital modulation was\nlower when the observed X-ray flux was higher.

Of particular interest are the class of control variates which are\nanalytically calculable, such as the recently introduced 'Zeldovich control\nvariates' for the power spectrum of matter and biased tracers. In this work we\npresent the construction of perturbative control variates in Eulerian and\nLagrangian perturbation theory, and adopt the matter bispectrum as a case\nstudy. Eulerian control variates are analytically tractable for all $n$-point\nfunctions, but we show that their correlation with the $N$-body $n$-point\nfunction decays at a rate proportional to the sum-of-squared wavenumbers,\nhampering their utility. We show that the Zeldovich approximation, while\npossessing an analytically calculable bispectrum, is less correlated at low-$k$\nthan its Eulerian counterpart. We introduce an alternative -- the 'shifted\ncontrol variate' -- which can be constructed to have the correct tree-level\n$n$-point function, is Zeldovich-resummed, and in principle has an analytically\ntractable bispectrum. We find that applying this shifted control variate to the\n$z=0.5$ matter bispectrum is equivalent to averaging over $10^4$ simulations\nfor the lowest-$k$ triangles considered.

By\ncontrast, eccentric binaries (with in-band eccentricity\n$e_{10\\mathrm{Hz}}\\gtrsim 0.1$) typically inspiral too quickly for gas torques\nto act, preserving the post-encounter spin-orbit misalignments and yielding\nmore isotropic $\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ distributions when disk densities and\ntorque efficiencies are modest.

Using the Ultra BroadBand (UBB) receiver, spanning 1.3-6.0 GHz,\nwe detected over 700 unique bursts across four observing epochs. A\ncomprehensive analysis of their temporal and spectral properties reveals four\ndistinct spectro-temporal morphologies, including simple, complex and\nfrequency-drifting structures. No bursts were detected across the full UBB\nband, confirming the band-limited emission typical of repeating FRBs. We find\nmodest frequency evolution in burst widths but constant fractional bandwidths,\nand strong variability in burst rates that may be influenced by scintillation.\nThe waiting-time distributions indicate predominantly independent burst events,\nwith occasional clustering suggesting a characteristic emission timescale of\n$\\sim$10 ms. Additionally, this study presents a multi-frequency analysis of\nwaiting-time distributions, offering new insights into the complex frequency\ndrifts commonly observed in repeating FRBs. These broadband observations\nprovide a detailed view of the frequency-dependent burst behavior of FRB\n20240110A and offer insights into the variability and temporal structure of\nrepeating FRB emission."}

Despite a\nrich data set there is, still, no consensus about the physical nature and\norigin of this event. AT 2018cow remained UV bright 2-4 years after the\nexplosion, which points at an additional energy injection source, most likely\nfrom an accretion disk. We present additional late time UV data obtained with\nthe Hubble Space Telescope, to show there is no significant fading in the\noptical since the last epoch and only marginal fading in the UV. The new UV\ndata points match the predictions of previously published accretion disk\nmodels, where the disk is assumed to form from the tidal disruption of a low\nmass star by an intermediate mass black hole. This consistency provides\nevidence that AT 2018cow could indeed be a tidal disruption event. The marginal\ndecay is in contrast with the predictions of light curves produced by\ninteracting supernovae. The difference between expectations for disc emission\nand interacting supernovae will further increase with time, making data at even\nlater times a route to robustly rule out interaction between supernova ejecta\nand circumstellar material."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "Combinations of galaxy surveys and cosmic microwave background secondaries,\nsuch as the thermal Sunyaev Zeldovich (tSZ) effect, are increasingly being used\nto jointly constrain cosmology and astrophysical properties of the gas within\nand beyond halos. Standard cross-correlations measure a directionless\ncorrelation between the microwave maps and galaxy catalogs. However, more\ninformation about the cosmic web structure can be captured by summary\nstatistics which include environmental constraints and measure oriented\ncorrelations along axes of structure, such as filaments or superclusters. This\nwork studies the sensitivity of multipole moments of constrained oriented\nstacks, a directional and environmentally-dependent statistic, to variations in\ncosmological and astrophysical parameters. We run nine different 2.4\nGpc-per-side simulations with the Websky algorithm, varying the dark matter\nenergy density within flat $\\Lambda$CDM, and create mock tSZ maps with each. We\nalso apply six different gas prescriptions, imitating AGN feedback variations,\nto the fiducial cosmology. We analyze oriented stacks of the tSZ signal in\nsupercluster regions in each simulation, focusing on signal out to $\\sim20$\ntransverse Mpc from massive ($M>5\\times10^{13}~M_\\odot$) halos. The cosmology\nvariations affect anisotropic and isotropic measurements similarly, while the\nhalo-pasted gas variations mostly affect the isotropic signal.

However, it is subject to a\nparticular choice for its parametrization, which acts as a prior assumption.\nMost studies have been restricted to what has become a standard CLF\nparametrization with little to no variation. The goal of this paper is to\ninvestigate whether this model is sufficient to fully characterize the\nsmall-scale data extracted from spectroscopic surveys and to gauge how adding\nor removing degrees of freedom impact the inference regarding the galaxy-halo\nconnection. After extensive validation with realistic mock data, we use\nBasilisk, a highly constraining Bayesian hierarchical tool to model the\nkinematics and abundance of satellite galaxies, to test the standard CLF model\nagainst a slew of more flexible variants. In particular, we test whether the\nSDSS data favour any of these variants in terms of a goodness-of-fit\nimprovement, and identify the models that are sufficiently flexible, beyond\nwhich additional model freedom is not demanded by the data. We show that some\nof these additional degrees of freedom, which have hitherto not been\nconsidered, result in a drastic improvement of the fit and cause significant\nchanges in the inferred galaxy-halo connection. This highlights that an\nempirical model comes with an implicit prior about the parametrization form,\nwhich needs to be addressed to ensure that it is sufficiently flexible to\ncapture the complexity of the data and to safeguard against a biased inference."}

This conversion often proceeds through non-perturbative mechanisms\nsuch as parametric resonance, which is described by Hill's equation. In this\nwork, we investigate how stochastic fluctuations in the parameters of Hill's\nequation can influence particle production during reheating. We show that such\nfluctuations can arise from couplings to light scalar fields, and can\nsignificantly alter the stability bands in the resonance structure, thereby\nenhancing the growth of fluctuations and broadening the region of efficient\nenergy transfer. Using random matrix theory and stochastic differential\nequations, we decompose the particle growth rate into deterministic and\nnoise-induced components and demonstrate analytically and numerically that even\nmodest noise leads to substantial particle production in otherwise stable\nregimes.

This\npaper investigates a scenario in which a dark matter decays and the dark\ndaughter particle moves with respect to the comoving mother particle. The model\nis parameterised by the decay rate and the injection velocity of the dark\nmatter particles, which can be converted to the mass ratio. In previous work, a\nsimpler model was used to investigate the evolution of cosmic voids typified as\nregions with low content of galaxies and non-baryonic matter.

Accepted for publishing in Classical and\n  Quantum Gravity", "summary": "Differences in the values of the Hubble constant obtained from the local\nuniverse and the early universe have resulted in a significant tension. This\ntension signifies that our understanding of cosmology (physical processes\nand/or cosmological data) is incomplete. Some of the suggested solutions\ninclude physics of the early Universe. In this paper we aim to investigate\ncommon features of various early universe solutions to the Hubble constant\ntension. The physics of the early universe affects the size of the sound\nhorizon which is probed with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Within\nthe standard model, the size of the horizon (within limits of current\nmeasurements) is affected by processes that could occur between (approximately)\n1 day after the Big Bang and the last scattering instant. We focus on simple\nextensions incorporating Early Dark Energy (EDE) and show how such a model\naffects the inferred values of the Hubble constant. We compare this model to\nLambdaCDM models using MCMC analysis, likelihoods over the parameter space and\nBayesian evidence. The MCMC analysis shows that EDE leads to a decrease in the\nsize of the sound horizon that is consistent with H0 = 73.56 km/s/Mpc but we\nalso show that MCMC analysis favours increasing redshift and proportion of EDE.\nThe Bayesian evidence favours our EDE model for very narrow, finely-tuned\nparameter space. The LambdaCDM model used for comparison has good evidence\nacross a wide parameter space. We interpret this as an indication that more\nsophisticated models are required.

The observation that many black holes have reached\nsupermassive status while obeying the Eddington limit is puzzling as accretion\nmodels are not spherically symmetric. We address this issue by illustrating the\nphysics behind a picture of inner disk accretion involving a geometrically\nthick, hot quasi-spherical flow and argue that such an inner region provides\nthe radiation that instantiates the Eddington limit. Given the energetics of\nthe inner disk edge, we show how the characteristic electron cross-section\ndrops below its Thomson value, allowing black holes to grow rapidly despite\nbeing Eddington-limited. Indeed, after implementing a modified cross-section\ncalculated via the Klein-Nishina Formula, we find that SMBH formation time\ndrops by up to $47\\%$. In this context, we show how a $10^{9} M_{\\odot}$ black\nhole can form from a seed $10 M_{\\odot}$ black hole within $500$ Myr by way of\naccretion and mergers.

This model assumes sub-Alfv\\'enic interstellar\nturbulence in the surrounding medium of the pulsar and a rough alignment of the\nline-of-sight of observers towards the pulsars with the local mean magnetic\nfield direction in the halo. In this model, the expected morphology of a pulsar\nhalo is highly dependent on the properties of the interstellar magnetic field.\nWe investigate the anisotropic diffusion of electron-positron pairs across\nmultiple coherence of magnetic fields in pulsar halos in this work. We focus\nparticularly on their influences on the predicted gamma-ray surface brightness\nprofile and the asymmetry of the halo's morphology, as well as the\nobservational expectations by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory\n(LHAASO). Our results indicate that the requirement of a specific magnetic\nfield geometry can be alleviated when accounting for a limited (and realistic)\ncoherence length of the magnetic field in the model. Also, the halo's\nmorphology may appear less asymmetric, especially after being smoothed by the\npoint spread function of instruments. It largely relaxes the tension between\nthe asymmetric morphology of halos predicted by the model and lack of apparent\nasymmetric halos detected so far. Our findings demonstrate the important\ninfluence of the coherence length of interstellar magnetic field on the\ndistribution of particles around their accelerators, and the consequence on the\nmeasured source morphology."}

Submitted to A&A", "summary": "Identifying the progenitors of thermonuclear supernovae (Type Ia supernovae;\nSNe Ia) remains a key objective in contemporary astronomy. The rare subclass of\nSNe Ia that interacts with circumstellar material (Type Ia-CSM) allows for\nstudies of the progenitor's environment before explosion, and generally favours\nsingle-degenerate progenitor channels. The case of SN Ia-CSM PTF11kx clearly\nconnected thermonuclear explosions with hydrogen-rich CSM-interacting events,\nand the more recent SN 2020eyj connected SNe Ia with helum-rich companion\nprogenitors. Here we present a study of SN 2020aeuh, a Type Ia-CSM with delayed\ninteraction. We analyse photometric and spectroscopic data that monitor the\nevolution of SN 2020aeuh and compare its properties with those of peculiar SNe\nIa and core-collapse SNe. At early times, the evolution of SN 2020aeuh\nresembles a slightly overluminous SN Ia. Later, the interaction-dominated\nspectra develop the same pseudocontinuum seen in Type Ia-CSM PTF11kx and SN\n2020eyj. However, the later-time spectra of SN 2020aeuh lack hydrogen and\nhelium narrow lines. Instead, a few narrow lines could be attributed to carbon\nand oxygen. We fit the pseudobolometric light curve with a CSM-interaction\nmode, yielding a CSM mass of 1-2 M$_{\\odot}$. We propose that SN 2020aeuh was a\nType Ia supernova that eventually interacted with a dense medium which was\ndeficient in both hydrogen and helium. Whereas previous SNe Ia-CSM constitute\nour best evidence for nondegenerate companion progenitors, the CSM around SN\n2020aeuh is more difficult to understand. We include a hydrodynamical\nsimulation for a double-degenerate system to showcase how the dynamical\nevolution of such a progenitor scenario could produce the CSM observed around\nSN 2020aeuh. It is clear that SN 2020aeuh challenges current models for stellar\nevolution leading up to a SN Ia explosion."}

This results in relativistic beaming, making blazars among\nthe most luminous extragalactic sources across the electromagnetic spectrum,\nfrom radio waves to gamma-rays and, potentially, in high-energy neutrinos. We\npresent a comprehensive study of multi-messenger emission from blazar jets\npowered by magnetic reconnection occurring at varying distances from the\nsupermassive black hole (SMBH). By generalizing previous models, we explore how\nthe emission characteristics depend self-consistently on the spatial evolution\nof key jet properties, including magnetization, bulk Lorentz factor, and\nexternal photon fields (accretion disc, broad-line region, and dusty torus).\nUsing numerical simulations, we examined the impact of the initial jet\nmagnetization, particle acceleration efficiency, jet-to-accretion power ratio,\nand mass accretion rate on the broadband photon spectra and neutrino emission.\nOur findings reveal distinct emission regimes characterized by different\ndominant radiative processes: synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton dominate\ncloser to the SMBH where magnetization is high, while external Compton (EC)\nprocesses become significant near the broad-line region (BLR). Neutrino\nproduction efficiency is highest upstream of the BLR, driven by enhanced photon\ntarget densities from synchrotron and external photons available for photopion\ninteractions, whereas the proton particle distribution is hard. Our model\npredictions are compared with observations of gamma-ray luminosities and\nsynchrotron peak energies of Fermi-detected blazars, highlighting magnetic\nreconnection as a potential mechanism driving both electromagnetic and neutrino\nemissions in astrophysical jets."}

It could not only identify a new component of the\nastrophysical neutrino flux, but also characterize how its spectrum\nextrapolates from GeV to PeV energies.

Using the 16.8 yr\nFermi-LAT data, an extended emission, with a significance of 13.5 $\\sigma$ and\na radius 0.24{\\deg} in 0.2--500 GeV in the uniform-disk model, was found to the\nadjacent east of the SNR. With archival Mopra CO-line data, a large molecular\nclump at local-standard-of-rest velocity $\\sim-48$ to $-43$ km s$^{-1}$ was\nrevealed appearing coincident with the gamma-ray source. The SNR was found\nlocated in a cavity encircled by a 'C'-shaped ring-like molecular shell at\n$-45$ to $-43$ km s$^{-1}$. This morphological agreement, together with the\nposition-velociy diagrams made along lines cutting across the cavity, suggests\nthat the SNR was evolving in the expanding molecular bubble created by the\nstellar wind of the progenitor with a mass $\\gtrsim 15 M_{\\mathrm{sun}}$. The\ngiant molecular cloud, visible at around $-46$ km s$^{-1}$, and the associated\nSNR are thus estimated to lie at a kinematic distance of 3.1 kpc, with the HI\nabsorption taken into account. We suggest that the SNR has entered the\nradiative phase after the blastwave recently struck the cavity wall. With the\nevolutionary scenario of the SNR, we demonstrate that the gamma-ray emission\nreported here can be naturally interpreted by the hadronic interaction between\nthe accelerated protons that escaped from the SNR shock and the eastern large\nmolecular clump."}

Using 866 publicly available spectra from 393 SNe, 407 from\ntype IIb SNe (SNe IIb) and 459 from type II SNe (SNe II), we analysed H$\\alpha$\nand He~I 5876 A at early phases ($<40$ days from the explosion) to identify\npossible differences between these two SN types. By comparing the\npseudo-equivalent width (pEW) and full width at half maximum (FWHM), we find\nthat the strength of the absorption component of these lines serves as a\nquantitative discriminator, with SNe IIb exhibiting stronger lines at all\ntimes. The most significant differences emerge within the first 10-20 days. To\nassess the statistical significance of these differences, we apply statistical\nmethods and machine-learning techniques. Population density evolution reveals a\nclear distinction in both pEW and FWHM. Quadratic Discriminant Analysis\nconfirms distinct evolutionary patterns, particularly in pEW, while FWHM\nvariations are less pronounced. A combination of t-distributed Stochastic\nNeighbour Embedding and Linear Discriminant Analysis effectively separates the\ntwo SN types. Additionally, a Random Forest Classifier demonstrates the\nrobustness of pEW and FWHM as classification criteria, allowing for accurate\nclassification of newly observed SNe II and IIb based on computed\nclassification probabilities. Applying our method to low-resolution spectra\nobtained from the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient, a\nmagnitude-limited survey, we identified 34 misclassified SNe. This revision\nincreases the estimated fraction of SNe IIb from 4.0% to 7.26%. This finding\nsuggests that misclassification significantly impacts the estimated\ncore-collapse SN rate. Our approach enhances classification accuracy and\nprovides a valuable tool for future supernova studies."}

However, while\nother telescopes must point their limited field of view, IceCube can perform\nfull-sky realtime follow-up of astrophysical transient sources with high\nuptime. For this, IceCube uses its Fast Response Analysis (FRA), which can\nprovide results from an unbinned maximum likelihood analysis within tens of\nminutes of an astrophysical transient. Besides manually selected transient\ncandidates, it also routinely scans areas of the sky compatible with\ngravitational wave alerts from LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA and the IceCube event singlets\nmost likely to originate from an astrophysical source. Currently the analysis\nuses TeV muon neutrino candidate events whose signature permits especially\nprecise angular reconstruction, selected and reconstructed at the South Pole\nand transmitted with low-latency over satellite. Recently, different event\nselections are also being included in IceCube analyses. These efforts include\nthe follow-up of gravitational wave events with GeV neutrinos detected by\nIceCube-DeepCore and the observation of the Galactic plane with cascade events\nproduced by all neutrino flavors. If made available on a day-scale latency,\nthese event selections can also be used in FRAs.

Additionally, LHAASO, HAWC, and HESS\nhave reported over forty galactic gamma-ray sources with energies above 100\nTeV. Detecting neutrinos correlated with high-energy gamma-ray sources would\nprovide compelling evidence of cosmic-ray acceleration in these galactic\nsources. In this work, we compile a 12.3-year, full-sky, all-flavor dataset,\nthe IceCube Multi-Flavor Astrophysics Neutrino sample (ICEMAN). ICEMAN is the\ncombination of three largely independent neutrino samples of different event\nmorphologies and builds upon the previous work of the DNN-based cascade sample,\nEnhanced Starting Track Event Selection, and the Northern Track sample. Recent\nimprovements in ice modeling and detector calibration are also incorporated\ninto the cascade reconstruction. In addition to revisiting the galactic plane,\nwe adopt two different analysis methods to search for galactic PeVatrons.\nFirst, we use a template-based approach to probe the Cygnus Cocoon region.\nSecond, we use a point source hypothesis to find correlations between IceCube\nneutrinos and gamma-ray sources detected at energies greater than 100 TeV."}

Intriguing examples so far include blazar flares\nand tidal disruption events coincident with IceCube neutrinos. Here, we report\nthe first all-flavor, all-sky time-dependent search for neutrino sources by\ncombining IceCube throughgoing tracks, starting tracks and cascades.\nThroughgoing tracks provide the best sensitivity in the Northern Sky, while\ncascades have worse angular resolution but yield better sensitivity in the\nSouthern Sky than tracks. The relatively new starting tracks sample has reduced\ncontamination from atmospheric muons. This analysis takes advantage of the\nstrengths of each of the datasets, combining them for increased statistics and\nobtaining the best accessible all-sky sensitivity for transient searches. In\nthis search, we look for unbound $E^{-\\gamma}$ power-law sources, as well as\n$E^{-2}$ sources with low and high-energy exponential cutoffs, optimizing the\nsensitivity for the duration of the flares."}

Data release available at\n  https://github.com/sugwg/O4_preview_population", "summary": "We present a preliminary catalog of compact binary merger candidates from the\nongoing fourth observing run (O4) of Advanced LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, based on\nan analysis of public alerts distributed through GraceDB as of May 2025. We\ndeveloped and applied methods to estimate the source-frame chirp mass for each\ncandidate by utilizing information from public data products, including source\nclassification probabilities, sky localizations, and observatory status.\nCombining our O4 analysis with previous catalogs, we provide updated estimates\nfor the local merger rate density. For sources with chirp mass characteristic\nof binary neutron stars ($[1, 1.5]\\,M_\\odot$), we find a rate of\n$56^{+99}_{-40}$ $\\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\\,\\textrm{yr}^{-1}$. For systems in the\nexpected neutron star--black hole chirp mass range ($[1.5, 3.5]\\,M_\\odot$), the\nrate is $36^{+32}_{-20}$ $\\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\\,\\textrm{yr}^{-1}$, and for heavier\nbinary black holes ($[3.5, 100]\\,M_\\odot$), we estimate a rate of\n$19^{+4}_{-2}$ $\\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\\,\\textrm{yr}^{-1}$. This work provides an\nearly glimpse into the compact binary population being observed in O4; we\nidentify a number of high-value candidates up to signal-to-noise $\\sim 80$,\nwhich we expect to enable precision measurements in the future."}

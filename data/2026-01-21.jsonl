With the upcoming Roman Space Telescope, scheduled for launch in 2026, a new and powerful channel for their detection - astrometric microlensing - will become available. We set out to create a realistic sample of simulated gravitational microlensing events as observed by Roman with the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey. We focus in particular on the population of NS lenses, which has until now been largely understudied. We use state-of-the-art Galactic models tailored for application to microlensing by compact objects. We simulate four different NS populations with Maxwellian natal kick distributions: $\\bar{v} = (150, \\ 250, \\ 350, \\ 450)$ km/s. We apply projected Roman precision, cadence, and detectability criteria. We find the parameter space $\\log_{10} t_{\\rm E}$ - $\\log_{10} θ_{\\rm E}$, which will be accessible to Roman observations, to be maximally efficient for classification of stellar remnants. We find a feature in this space that is characteristic to NS; using this feature, optimal samples of NS candidates can be constructed from Roman-like datasets. We describe the dependence of observable parameter distributions on the assumed mean kick velocities. As the effects of natal kicks are very complex and mutually counteracting, we suggest more detailed studies focused on the dynamics of NS are needed in anticipation of Roman and future surveys. We estimate Roman will observe approximately $11\\,000$ microlensing events - including $\\sim100$ with NS lenses - whose both photometric and astrometric signal are detectable; the event yield decreases by $38\\%$ if gap-filling low-cadence observations are not included. We make all simulated microlensing event datasets publicly available in preparation for Roman data."}

As part of the POLAMI program, we have conducted 14 years of 1 mm and 3 mm polarization monitoring of a sample of gamma-ray-bright blazars with the IRAM 30-m telescope, complemented here with long-term optical polarimetric observations from multiple facilities. We aim to test whether current models of parsec-scale jet physics are consistent with observed multi-band polarization behavior. Using a Bayesian framework, we derive intrinsic mean flux densities and modulation indices for total flux and fractional polarization, and characterize EVPA variability using circular statistics. We then examine how these quantities reflecting variability properties across millimeter and optical bands relate to synchrotron peak frequency, jet orientation, and radio/gamma-ray luminosities. BL Lac objects exhibit, on average, higher fractional polarization and lower EVPA variability than FSRQs at all wavelengths. Fractional polarization increases with frequency, consistent with increasingly ordered magnetic fields at shorter wavelengths. BL Lacs also show more frequent alignment of EVPAs between optical and millimeter bands, whereas FSRQs display weaker coherence. EVPA variability correlates positively with radio and gamma-ray luminosities and negatively with synchrotron peak frequency, most strongly in the optical. We further find a positive correlation between EVPA spread and fractional polarization variability, suggesting a direct link between magnetic-field structure and polarization dynamics."}

The accuracy of the photometry is assessed by cross-matching to public catalogues. In addition, we injected a population of synthetic GRB afterglows into a subset of the DWF DECam imaging to compare the efficiency of our pipeline with a standard difference imaging approach. Both pipelines show performance and reliably recover injected transients with peak magnitudes $g<22$ AB mag with an efficiency of $97.24^{+0.7}_{-1.0}$ percent for \\texttt{dwf-postpipe} and $96.14^{+0.9}_{-1.1}$ percent for a difference imaging approach. However, we find that $\\texttt{dwf-postpipe}$ is less likely to recover transients appearing in galaxies that are brighter or comparable in brightness to the transient itself. To demonstrate the power of the data in this release, we conduct a search for uncatalogued variable stars in a single night of DWF DECam imaging and find ten pulsating variables, two eclipsing binaries and one ZZ ceti. We also conduct a search for variable phenomena in the Chandra Deep Field South, a Rubin deep drilling field, and identify two flares from likely UV ceti type stars."}

For a diffraction-limited PSF, as arises in space-based missions, this correction depends on each galaxy SED. In the Euclid mission, galaxy SED reconstruction, a tasks of the photometric-redshift processing function (PHZ PF), relies on broad- and medium-band ancillary photometry. The limited wavelength sampling of the Euclid VIS passband and signal-to-noise ratio may affect the reconstruction accuracy and translate into biases in the weak lensing measurements. In this study, we present the methodology, which is employed in the Euclid PHZ PF, for reconstructing galaxy SEDs at 55 wavelengths, sampling the VIS passband every 10 nm, and we assess whether it fulfils the accuracy requirements imposed on the Euclid PSF model. We employ both physics- and data-driven methods, focusing on a new approach of template-based flux correction and Gaussian processes, and we introduce an SED metric whose bias propagates into PSF quadrupole moment errors. Our findings demonstrate that Gaussian processes and template fitting meet the requirements only in specific, but complementary, redshift intervals. We therefore propose a hybrid approach, which leverages both methods. This solution proves to be effective in meeting the Euclid accuracy requirements for most of the redshift range of the survey. Finally, we investigate the impact on the SED reconstruction of a new set of 16 evenly-spaced medium-band filters for the Subaru telescope, providing quasi-spectroscopic coverage of the VIS passband. This study shows promising results, ensuring accurate SED reconstruction and meeting the mission PSF requirements. This work thus provides not only the methodological foundation of galaxy SED reconstruction in the Euclid PHZ PF, but also a roadmap for future improvements using a new medium-band survey."}

For the 2025 outburst, we reported the detection of pulsations with the Einstein Probe (EP). Based on the $\\sim$3-year baseline between these two outbursts, we measured a significant long-term spin-down rate of $\\dotν= (-5.73 \\pm 0.28) \\times 10^{-14}~{\\rm Hz~s^{-1}}$. Assuming that the quiescent spin-down is driven by magnetic dipole radiation, we inferred a spin-down luminosity of $L \\approx 1.1 \\times 10^{36}~{\\rm erg~s^{-1}}$ and a surface dipolar magnetic field of $B \\approx (7.3 - 10.4) \\times 10^8$ G. Furthermore, we conducted a deep radio pulsation search with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) during the X-ray quiescent state in 2024, resulting in a non-detection with a 7$σ$ flux density upper limit of 12.3 $μ$Jy. This corresponds to a radio efficiency upper limit of $ξ< 2.8 \\times 10^{-10}$, which is significantly lower than that of typical millisecond pulsars with a similar spin-down power. This profound radio pulsation faintness can be explained by two primary scenarios: either a geometric effect, wherein the pulsar's radio beam is directed away from our line of sight, or a physical suppression of the emission mechanism, potentially caused by a persistent low-level accretion flow during the X-ray quiescent state."}

This includes temperature anisotropies consistent with the first detection of a pair of core-sloshing cold fronts at z > 1. We identify a ghost cavity candidate and estimate its mechanical power as log10(Pcav/10^42 erg s^-1) = 2.66 +- 0.23, confirming that radiative cooling strongly exceeds active galactic nucleus feedback heating. We show that SPT-CL J2215-3537 is likely in a short transient phase preceding the onset of a self-regulated cooling-feedback cycle. We recalculate traditional X-ray morphological parameters and discuss how non-self-similar evolution of parameters sensitive to the surface brightness cuspiness can bias dynamical classifications at high redshift."}

We also find enhanced negative energy-at-infinity density in plasmoids near the ergosphere.

It is a positive quantity and bounded by causality. It is defined as the rate of change of pressure with respect to the system's density. In this article, we derive a covariant equation for the sound wave and demonstrate how the wave equation is modified in the general relativistic formalism. One can then define an effective speed of sound by attenuating the usual definition of sound speed with the gravitational metric potential. The general relativistic curvature effect is observed to reduce the speed of sound when computed inside a neutron star. This effectively makes the star relatively softer (according to the equation of state). The change in the effective sound speed can be easily visualised if one redefines the non-radial modes in terms of it. The modes do not change, but the space-time curvature reduces the amplitude of the oscillation modes. The formalism is suited for studying astrophysical compact objects."}

In this paper, we present our search methodologies, event flagging and classification algorithms and the resulting comprehensive event catalog. The catalog contains more than a million events in total, including known events such as gamma-ray bursts, soft-gamma repeater bursts, galactic X-ray source activities, terrestrial gamma flashes, and solar flares. For each candidate event, the catalog presents the event time, detection significance, event duration, hardness ratios, known-event flagging results, and classification probabilities. Our short-transient catalog significantly expands the currently-existing list of known events and complements the GBM trigger catalog. The event database with filtering capabilities is also publicly available at https://magnetars.sabanciuniv.edu/gbm, which allows users to retrieve event information based on their input queries along with the event lightcurves."}

However, its practical application is often hampered by the challenge of having to compute the Bayesian evidence - a multi-dimensional integral over the product of likelihood and prior probability. This usually necessitates a large number of function calls to the likelihood, which may become prohibitive in case of \"slow\", costly to evaluate likelihoods. A possible solution to this problem lies in approximating the slow full likelihood by a fast emulated likelihood. In this paper, we introduce BOBE (Bayesian Optimisation for Bayesian Evidence), a method to construct a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)-based emulator. BOBE utilises a Bayesian Optimisation algorithm designed specifically to (i) provide a realistic estimate of the emulator's uncertainty and its impact on the evidence calculation, and (ii) minimise the number of likelihood evaluations required in order to meet a given evidence accuracy goal. We apply it to a number of toy examples as well as actual cosmological likelihoods, and demonstrate that training the emulator to a sufficient accuracy takes a factor of $O(10^3)$ fewer direct likelihood evaluations than would be needed if one were to directly compute the evidence integral via nested sampling. BOBE's overhead is independent of the likelihood computation time $t_L$, making it particularly useful for \"expensive\" likelihoods with $t_L \\gtrsim 1$~s. BOBE is written in Python, supports MPI parallelisation, takes advantage of automatic differentiation and just-in-time-compilation provided by JAX, can straightforwardly be implemented with cosmological data analysis frameworks such as Cobaya, and is available for download from https://github.com/Ameek94/BOBE."}

From pulsar radio observation, it is seen that a couple of pulsars reveal new emission components at higher radio frequencies, although they show single-component emission at lower frequencies. We develop a brief outline, fostering inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of the low-frequency radio photons as a vulnerable source of scattering, susceptible to explaining the evolution of new components of some radio pulsars at higher bands. We couple the conventional curvature radiation (CR) mechanism and ICS, and suggest that the spectral convolution of the flux component individually from CR and the modulated template due to the ICS scattered component can be combined to reproduce such signatures associated with the diverse morphology of the integrated pulse profile. We reproduce the beam frequency diagram, the geometrical variation of different parameters of the emission geometry, as well as the multi-frequency evolution from theory. We have suitably tuned the input parameter space and given the combination of parameters that can tune to a particular scattered frequency in tabulated form. We conclude that ICS may be a responsible process for describing the emergence of new components in higher radio emission bands."}

We find that the extrapolated linear density contrast computed from the spherical collapse model is suppressed when the strength of momentum transfer is increased. Using the Sheth-Tormen mass function, the cluster number counts are computed. The minimum mass limit in the mass integration for each redshift bin is determined by matching the predicted number counts from the $Λ$CDM model with the result from eROSITA surveys. We find that the number of clusters is maximal at a higher redshift bin, and the number of clusters in a maximum redshift bin is enhanced when the strength of momentum and energy transfers increases due to the reduction of extrapolated linear density contrast. Setting the parameters of the dark energy model with momentum coupling according to the observational constraints in \\cite{bestfit}, the predicted number counts from the coupled dark energy is larger than the result from eROSITA surveys. The statistical analysis yields a $p$-value of 0.189 for the proposed model relative to $Λ$CDM.

The position is coincident with that of an early-type star (OGLE ID SMC732.10.7). We detect the spin period at 341.71 s in NuSTAR data and infer a period of 63.65 days from the 15 year monitoring with OGLE, that we interpret as the orbital period of the system. A tentative CRSF at ~12.3 keV is identified in NuSTAR spectra with ~1.8-sigma. The source appears to show a persistent X-ray luminosity and an optical magnitude transition on the long timescale.

In this paper we show how the rapid final decay of the oscillons leads to an enhanced production of induced gravitational waves, whose energy density can saturate the observational bound on the effective number of relativistic species. We leverage this bound to constrain the inflaton mass, cubic, and quartic self-coupling in generic models that admit oscillon formation, providing novel and complementary constraints in regions of parameter space that are inaccessible with cosmic microwave background observations alone."}

As part of the POLAMI program, we have conducted 14 years of 1 mm and 3 mm polarization monitoring of a sample of gamma-ray-bright blazars with the IRAM 30-m telescope, complemented here with long-term optical polarimetric observations from multiple facilities. We aim to test whether current models of parsec-scale jet physics are consistent with observed multi-band polarization behavior. Using a Bayesian framework, we derive intrinsic mean flux densities and modulation indices for total flux and fractional polarization, and characterize EVPA variability using circular statistics. We then examine how these quantities reflecting variability properties across millimeter and optical bands relate to synchrotron peak frequency, jet orientation, and radio/gamma-ray luminosities. BL Lac objects exhibit, on average, higher fractional polarization and lower EVPA variability than FSRQs at all wavelengths. Fractional polarization increases with frequency, consistent with increasingly ordered magnetic fields at shorter wavelengths. BL Lacs also show more frequent alignment of EVPAs between optical and millimeter bands, whereas FSRQs display weaker coherence. EVPA variability correlates positively with radio and gamma-ray luminosities and negatively with synchrotron peak frequency, most strongly in the optical.

Broad emission lines in the absence of X-ray and radio counterparts suggest that they host accreting supermassive black holes embedded in dense gaseous envelopes. This black-hole-envelope configuration facilitates efficient photohadronic interactions and neutrino production. Remarkably, their observed source number density and luminosity are compatible with the energetics of the diffuse neutrino background. We consider that relativistic jets and outflows are launched from the black hole and propagate through low-density polar funnels within envelopes, where particle acceleration and neutrino emission occur. This leads to LRDs being effectively hidden sources.

By deriving exact analytical solutions for two-flavor evolution in red turbulent matter-where correlations grow as $t^{|ν|}$-we uncover a novel acceleration of coherence loss. This dynamical decoherence mechanism raises an effective energy barrier against the collective growth of flavor instabilities. Translating our master-equation results into an effective damping rate for FFC linear analysis, we find that realistic red turbulence ($ν\\sim -1$, fluctuation strength $ξ_ν\\sim 0.1$) can elevate the FFC threshold by a factor of $\\sim 3-5$, potentially stabilizing regions that would otherwise undergo explosion-killing flavor equilibration (or vice versa).

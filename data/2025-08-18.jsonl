Still, the vast\nmajority of supernova (SN) models assume RSG progenitors in hydrostatic\nequilibrium. Here, we self-consistently follow the hydrodynamic evolution of\nRSGs with different masses and the development of radial envelope pulsations.\nPulsations significantly alter the observable pre- and post-SN properties, and\ntheir importance increases substantially as a function of initial mass. We\ndemonstrate that it is not advisable to infer core masses, let alone initial\nmasses, from a single pre-SN luminosity and effective temperature of high-mass\nRSGs, as these quantities can vary by an order of magnitude during the\npulsation. For all masses considered, we find that pulsations can naturally\nlead to \"early-excess\" emission in SN light-curves and to variations in the\nearly photospheric velocity evolution compared to hydrostatic models that can\nhelp break the degeneracies in type-II SNe. We compare to SN 2023ixf, for which\na pulsating RSG progenitor was discovered. We demonstrate that its pre- and\npost-SN characteristics agree very well with our exploding pulsating RSG model,\nwhile hydrostatic stellar models are not well-suited. The data coverage at\nearly times is insufficient to break all the degeneracies in the progenitor and\nSN parameters, but we find some constraints on the explosion phase. We show\nthat there is no evidence for the claimed pulsation period of the SN 2024ggi\nprogenitor, as it is consistent with the orbital period of Spitzer. This study\nemphasizes the importance of hydrodynamical pre-SN stellar models for studying\nSNe and implies an important shift in our understanding of the last stages of\nmassive star evolution, the interpretation of pre-SN properties, the connection\nbetween SNe and their progenitors, and the missing RSG problem."}

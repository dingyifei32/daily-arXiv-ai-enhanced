The implications of these early galaxies for reionization\nare less clear, however. The CMB is one of the few windows into the ionization\nstate of the IGM during reionization's first half, providing an important probe\nof the ionizing photon sources at those times. Meanwhile, measurements of the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest in the spectra of high-$z$ quasars have improved to the\nlevel of tightly constraining the timing of reionization's end. In this paper,\nwe use radiative transfer simulations to explore how measurements of the patchy\nkinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (pkSZ) effect, when combined with Lyman-$\\alpha$\nforest measurements, can be used to constrain the early stages of reionization\nand the nature of its sources. For a given source model, we find that the\namplitude of the pkSZ power spectra strongly correlates with the start time of\nreionization, and constrains the number of ionizing photons produced by the\nhigh-$z$ source population. Allowing for variations in the source model, this\ncorrelation is weakened by a degeneracy between the reionization history and\nthe effects of source clustering. However, we demonstrate two potential ways of\nbreaking this degeneracy using: (1) measurements of large-scale fluctuations in\nthe Ly$\\alpha$ forest opacity at $z=5-6$, and/or; (2) the shape of the pkSZ\npower spectrum measured in future CMB surveys. Models with highly clustered\nsources yield steeper slopes in the pkSZ power around $\\ell = 3,000$, so\nmeasurements at additional angular scales can be used to break the\nhistory-clustering degeneracy. Our results highlight how future pkSZ\nmeasurements will complement JWST observations to improve our understanding of\nthe ionizing sources near cosmic dawn."}

In this\ncontext, determining the optimal survey configuration for an analysis that\ncombines galaxy clustering, weak lensing, and galaxy-galaxy lensing, the\nso-called 3x2pt analysis, remains an open problem. In this paper, we present an\nefficient and flexible end-to-end pipeline to optimise the sample selection for\n3x2pt analyses in an automated way. Our pipeline is articulated in two main\nsteps: we first consider a self-organising map to determine the photometric\nredshifts of a simulated galaxy sample. As a proof of method for stage-IV\nsurveys, we use samples from the DESC Data Challenge 2 catalogue. This allows\nus to classify galaxies into tomographic bins based on their colour phenotype\nclustering. We then explore different redshift-bin edge configurations for weak\nlensing only as well as 3x2pt analyses in a novel way. Our method explores\nmultiple configurations of perturbed redshift-bin edges with respect to the\nfiducial case in an iterative manner.

In\nthis paper, we present technical improvements to the method and apply it to\nspin $a_*=0.9$ BHs, which power relativistic jets. We first test the new\nmultizone set-up with a smaller Bondi radius, $R_B\\approx400\\,r_g$, where $r_g$\nis the gravitational radius.

Detailed\nanalysis of the multi-wavelength afterglow light curves of recent GRBs indeed\nshows evidence for an extended angular structure beyond the jet's narrow core.\nThe afterglow emission is determined by the jet angular structure, our viewing\nangle, and the magnetic field structure behind the shock, often leading to\ndegeneracies when considering the light curves and broad-band spectrum alone.\nSuch degeneracies can be lifted with joint modeling of the afterglow light\ncurves and polarization.

PSR J0007+7303, a very bright\ngamma-ray pulsar, is the first pulsar discovered by the Fermi-LAT telescope. In\nthis paper, we present the 15 years of timing results of this pulsar using the\nFermi-LAT data. We identified nine glitches, five of which are newly\ndiscovered. Among these, two are small glitches, occurring between the three\npreviously reported ones, while the other four are large glitches. The glitches\nexhibit fractional frequency changes ranging from 15 x 10^-9 to 1238 x 10^-9,\nwith intervals of approximately 1-2 years between events. Uniquely, this pulsar\nshows no exponential recovery behavior following any glitch, setting it apart\nfrom most glitching pulsars. Furthermore, no significant changes were observed\nin the gamma-ray pulse profile, flux, or phase-averaged spectra before and\nafter glitches, indicating the stability of the pulsar's emission properties\ndespite internal changes. A parametric analysis of the glitches yielded a\nfractional moment of inertia of the crustal superfluid involved in glitches as\n1.06 percent, which matches extremely well with previous statistical work if\nthe non-dissipative entrainment effect is not considered and strongly supports\nthe internal origin of these glitches. These results highlight the distinct\nglitch behavior of PSR J0007+7303 and offer valuable insights into the\ncrust-superfluid interaction in neutron stars. The physical origin of no\nexponential recovery is also discussed."}

We present our analysis of 16.3 years of Fermi-LAT measurements,\nwhich - combined with newly-published VERITAS data - constitute the deepest,\nmost extensive currently available gamma-ray dataset on M82. We model the NT\nradio to gamma-ray emission of the CSB as due to relativistic particles (CR).\nKey features of our models are the identification of the >50 GeV emission as\npionic and the use of X-ray and radio emission to calibrate the CRe spectrum.\nThis enables determination of the zero-point and slope of the CRp (and\nsecondary CRe) spectrum, and meaningful estimates of the energy densities of CR\nand magnetic fields. We consider all relevant radiative processes involving CR,\nand use published detailed descriptions of the soft radiation fields in the CSB\nregion - the most important of which is the FIR field, modeled as a graybody.\nOur SED modeling indicates that 1) the >10 GeV emission is mostly pionic, 2)\nthe 0.1 < E/GeV < 10 emission is a combination of pionic and Compton/starlight\n(and subdominant NT bremss), 3) the <0.1 GeV gamma-ray emission is leptonic,\nand 4) the radio spectrum arises from primary and secondary CRe synchrotron at\ncomparable levels: the corresponding CRe populations are described by a PL and\na curved spectrum, respectively. Averaged over the FIR graybody models, the CRp\nspectral index and energy density are 2.3 and 385 eV/cm3 (for n(H) = 200\n1/cm3), the primary-CRe and CRp maximum energies are 30 GeV and 7 TeV, and the\nmagnetic field is B = 120 uG.

Similarly, GRB\n150101B displayed remarkable similarities to GRB 170817A, further supporting\nits association with compact binary mergers. The objective of this study is to\nuncover the intrinsic properties that differentiate merger-associated sGRBs\nfrom other GRBs by analyzing the Fermi GBM Burst Catalog and using GRB 170817A\nand GRB 150101B as reference events, enhancing our ability to select events\nfrom this class and promptly to search for their electromagnetic counterpart.\nWe employed a clustering technique to classify GRBs based on their observed\nproperties in gamma-rays (T90, Epeak and fluence). Prior to clustering, we\ntested three dimensionality reduction techniques, among which Uniform Manifold\nApproximation and Projection demonstrated the best performance making it the\npreferred technique for our analysis. This combination of dimensionality\nreduction and clustering analysis allowed us to group GRBs with similar\ncharacteristics, with a focus on identifying those most likely associated with\nBNS mergers.

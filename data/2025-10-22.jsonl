This work\ninvestigates how the lensing signature and detectability of dark matter\nsubhalos in mock HST-, Euclid-, and JWST-like strong lensing observations\ndepends on the subhalo's radial density profile, especially with regards to the\ninner power-law slope, $\\beta$. We demonstrate that the minimum-mass subhalo\ndetectable along the Einstein ring of a system is strongly dependent on\n$\\beta$. In particular, we show that subhalos with $\\beta \\sim 2.2$ can be\ndetected down to masses over an order-of-magnitude lower than their\nNavarro-Frenk-White (NFW) counterparts with $\\beta \\sim 1$. Importantly, we\nfind that the detectability of subhalos with steep inner profiles is minimally\naffected by increasing the complexity of the main lens galaxy's mass model.\nThis is a unique characteristic of these subhalos, as those with NFW or\nshallower profiles become essentially undetectable when multipole perturbations\nare added to the lens model. The results of this work highlight how the\nunderlying dark matter physics can significantly impact the expected number of\nsubhalo detections from strong gravitational lensing observations. This is\nimportant for testing Cold Dark Matter against alternatives, such as\nSelf-Interacting Dark Matter, which predict the existence of subhalos with\ndiverse inner density profiles."}

While several modern cosmological simulations use the gas\nfraction-halo mass relation to calibrate their feedback implementations, we\nnote that this relation exhibits substantial intrinsic scatter whose origin has\nnot been fully elucidated. Using the large-volume FLAMINGO hydrodynamical\nsimulations, we examine the role of both central and satellite supermassive\nblack holes (BHs) in shaping this scatter, probing higher halo masses than\npreviously possible. For haloes with M500 < 10^13 Msun, we find that central BH\nmass correlates strongly and negatively with gas fraction, such that higher BH\nmasses give rise to lower gas fractions at fixed halo mass, consistent with\nprevious studies. Interestingly, however, for 10^13 Msun < M500 < 10^14.5 Msun\nthe correlation reverses and becomes positive, with overmassive BHs residing in\nhaloes with above-average gas fractions. By tracing progenitor BHs and haloes\nthrough cosmic time, we show that this behaviour is driven by the expulsion and\nsubsequent re-accretion of halo gas, regulated by the timing of BH growth and\nfeedback. Specifically, haloes that collapse earlier form BHs earlier, leading\nto earlier gas expulsion and re-accretion and a high gas fraction compared to\nhaloes of the same present-day mass that formed later. Our results demonstrate\nthat present-day scatter in the gas fraction-halo mass relation is strongly\nshaped by the early growth history of BHs and their haloes, a prediction that\ncan be tested with future observational measurements."}

We\nanalysed ~500 ks of XMM-Newton observations and studied for the first time the\ndiffuse emission around the pulsar.

We then performed a fit of the SED,\nincluding the spectrum of 1LHAASO J1740+0948u and the X-ray data obtained from\neither the analysis of the tail or the diffuse emission, to understand whether\none of the two X-ray sources could be related to the TeV emission and attempt a\nsource classification. The diffuse X-ray emission analysis resulted in upper\nlimits in the 0.5-10 keV range. The tail is best fitted with a power law with\n$\\Gamma=1.76\\pm0.06$ in 0.5-8 keV, with no significant detection of spectral\nvariations with distance. We do not find a good SED fit that can explain both\nthe X-ray tail and the LHAASO spectrum with reasonable parameters, suggesting\nthat the TeV emission likely comes from an older X-ray-faint electron\npopulation.

The gradients associated with these inhomogeneous\nplasma regions serve as free energy sources that can drive plasma\ninstabilities, including the lower-hybrid drift instability (LHDI). Notably,\nlower-hybrid waves are frequently observed in magnetized space plasma\nenvironments, such as Earth's magnetotail and magnetopause. Previous studies\nhave primarily focused on modeling particle acceleration via LHDI in these\nregions using a quasilinear approach. This study expands the investigation of\nLHDI to a broader range of environments, spanning weakly to strongly magnetized\nmedia, including interplanetary, interstellar, intergalactic, and intracluster\nplasmas. To explore the applicability of LHDI in various astrophysical\nsettings, we employ two key parameters: (1) plasma magnetization, characterized\nby the plasma beta parameter, and (2) the spectral slope of suprathermal\nelectrons following a power-law distribution. Using a quasilinear model, we\ndetermine the critical values of plasma beta and spectral slope that enable\nefficient electron acceleration via LHDI by comparing the rate of growth of\ninstability and the damping rate of the resulting fluctuations. We further\nanalyze the time evolution of the electron distribution function to confirm\nthese critical conditions. Our results indicate that electron acceleration is\ngenerally most efficient in low-beta plasmas ($\\beta < 1$). However, the\npresence of suprathermal electrons significantly enhances electron acceleration\nvia LHDI, even in high-beta plasmas ($\\beta > 1$). Finally, we discuss the\nastrophysical implications of our findings, highlighting the role of LHDI in\nelectron acceleration across diverse plasma environments."}

In this study, we present a comprehensive\nstatistical analysis of X-ray flares from 315 GRBs observed by the Swift/X-ray\nTelescope over nearly two decades. We categorize flares into prompt flares\n(occurring during the prompt emission phase) and afterglow flares and compare\ntheir temporal and luminosity properties. Our analysis reveals that both types\nof flares exhibit similar morphological characteristics, with prompt flares\nbeing brighter and occurring earlier than afterglow flares. We find strong\ncorrelations between flare parameters, such as peak time, duration, and\nluminosity, which follow consistent patterns across both flare types. These\nfindings suggest that X-ray flares, regardless of their timing, share a common\norigin in the central engine's activity.

By analyzing the latest observations from the Atacama\nCosmology Telescope (ACT)~\\cite{ACT:2025fju, ACT:2025tim}, we demonstrate that\nthe observed preference for positive running ($\\alpha_s$) of the scalar\nspectral index $n_s$ imposes significant restrictions on the parameter space of\nultra slow roll scenarios (USR). This tension becomes progressively pronounced\nfor more massive PBHs, posing substantial challenges for USR models to yield a\ndetectable PBH abundance, especially in the mass range probed by ongoing and\nfuture gravitational-wave experiments such as LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) and the\nEinstein Telescope (ET). However, this discrepancy is minimal for asteroid-mass\nPBHs, which are still capable of feasibly constituting the entirety of dark\nmatter (DM). To numerically probe the six-dimensional parameter space of\npolynomial models, we adapted a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to\nefficiently scan over the space of viable models. Our results further indicate\nthat, in non-minimally coupled polynomial inflation, a viable cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) spectrum is best obtained at an inflection point for which\nsecond-order slow-roll approximation is necessary for precise CMB predictions."}

However, the presence of Galactic foregrounds poses\nsignificant challenges, possibly biasing the $r$ estimate. In this study we\nexplore the viability of using Minkowski functionals (MFs) as a robustness test\nto validate a potential $r$ detection by identifying non-Gaussian features\nassociated with foregrounds contamination. To do so, we simulate sky maps as\nobserved by a LiteBIRD-like CMB experiment, with realistic instrumental and\nforegrounds modelling. The CMB $B$-mode signal is recovered through blind\ncomponent separation algorithms, and the obtained (biased) value of $r$ is used\nto generate Gaussian realisation of CMB signal. Their MFs are then compared\nwith those computed on maps contaminated by foreground residual left by\ncomponent separation, looking for a detection of non-Gaussianity. Our results\ndemonstrate that, with the experimental configuration considered here, MFs can\nnot be reliably adopted as a robustness test of an eventual $r$ detection, as\nwe find that in the majority of the cases MFs are not able to raise significant\nwarnings about the non-Gaussianity induced by the presence of foreground\nresiduals.

Accepted for publication in Astronomy &\n  Astrophysics", "summary": "Numerous astrophysical shock waves evolve in an environment where the\nradiative cooling behind the shock affects the hydrodynamical structure\ndownstream, thereby influencing the potential for particle acceleration via\ndiffusive shock acceleration (DSA).\n  We study the possibility for DSA to energize particles from the thermal pool\nand from pre-existing cosmic rays at radiative shocks, focusing on the case of\nsupernova remnants (SNRs). We rely on a semi-analytical description of particle\nacceleration at collisionless shocks in the test-particle limit, estimating the\ntotal proton and electron content from SNRs throughout the radiative phase. Our\nresults indicate that DSA can lead to significant particle acceleration during\nthe first few tens of kyrs of the radiative phase. Although the associated\nmulti-wavelength emission from SNRs in the radiative phase may not be\ndetectable with current observatories in most cases, the radiative phase is\nfound to lead to substantial deviations from the canonical p$^{-4}$ of the\ntest-particle limit. The hardening/steepening is due to an interplay between a\ngrowing contribution of the reaccelerated term as the SNR volume expands and\nthe effects of adiabatic and radiative losses on trapped particles as particles\nare confined for a longer time. The slope of the cumulative proton and electron\nspectra over the SNR lifetime thus depends on the environment in which the SNR\nshock propagates, and on the duration of the radiative phase during which DSA\ncan take place. Overall, DSA in the radiative phase can lead to a total\nelectron spectrum steeper than the proton spectrum, both at SNRs from\nthermonuclear and core-collapse SNe. Finally, we comment on the case of young\nradiative SNRs (in the first month to a few years after the explosion) for\nwhich the denser environments (with mass-loss rates of $\\dot{M} \\sim 10^{-1} -\n1$ M$_{\\odot}$/yr) tend to inhibit DSA."}

Both WR\nand BH mass probability distributions can be well approximated by unbiased\nlog-normal functions. Assuming that all WR stars with $M_\\mathrm{WR}\\gtrsim 6\nM_\\odot$ after core collapse are progenitors of the BHs, the similar shape of\ntheir mass distributions before and after collapse suggests a power-law\nrelation between them $M_{\\mathrm{BH}} \\simeq (0.39\\pm0.09)\n{M_{\\mathrm{WR}}}^{1.13\\pm0.09}$. Using the relation between masses of a WR\nstar and its CO-core, we obtain the empirical relation between the BH mass and\nCO-core of the collapsing WR star $M_\\mathrm{BH}\\sim 0.9 M_\\mathrm{CO}$, which\ncan be used in the population synthesis calculations."}

The remnants of four of these have all been very\ndeeply studied, and ultimately detected, by TeV instruments after exposures of\ntypically hundreds of hours. The measured TeV fluxes range from 1 Crab (by\ndefinition) down to 0.3% Crab. The location of the fifth supernova remnant tied\nto a historical record of its supernova (SN 1181) has never been studied at TeV\nenergies. The reason for this is simple - the associated remnant was only\nidentified as such in 2021. The remnant, Pa 30, is an unusual object whose\nproperties are best explained as resulting from a Type Iax supernova explosion.\nThese are a rare sub-type of Type Ia supernovae in which the merging white\ndwarfs are not fully destroyed by the supernova explosion, leading to a\ndouble-degenerate merger product colorfully described as a 'zombie star'. We\nwill present the results of a search for TeV gamma-ray emission from Pa 30 with\nVERITAS."}

Ionized outflows in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are thought to\ninfluence the evolution of their host galaxies and super-massive black holes\n(SMBHs). Distance is important to understand the kinetic power of the outflows\nas a cosmic feedback channel. However, the distance of the outflows with\nrespect to the central engine is poorly constrained. The density of the\noutflows is an essential parameter for estimating the distance of the outflows.\nNGC 5548 exhibits a variety of spectroscopic features in its archival spectra,\nwhich can be used for density analysis. Aims. We aim to use the variability of\nthe absorption lines from the archival spectra to obtain a density constraint\nand then estimate the distance of the outflows. Methods. We used the archival\nobservations of NGC 5548 taken with Chandra in January 2002 to search for\nvariations of the absorption lines. Results. We found that the Mg XII\nLy${\\alpha}$ and the O VIII Ly${\\beta}$ absorption lines have significant\nvariation on the 144 ks time scale and the 162 ks time scale during the\ndifferent observation periods. Based on the variability timescales and the\nphysical properties of the variable components that dominated these two\nabsorption lines, we derive a lower limit on the density of the variable warm\nabsorber components in the range of $7.2-9.0{\\times}10^{11} m^{-3}$, and an\nupper limit on their distance from the central source in the range of 0.2-0.5\npc."}

Accepted and to be published on\n  Journal of High Energy Astrophysics", "summary": "The term PeVatron designates astrophysical objects capable of accelerating\nparticles to PeV energies. Their nature and particle acceleration mechanisms\nare uncertain, but ultra-high-energy gamma rays are produced when particles\naccelerated by either leptonic or hadronic PeVatrons interact with the\nsurrounding medium or radiation fields. The atmospheric air shower observatory\nLHAASO detected photons with energies above 100 TeV from 43 sources in the\nGalactic Plane, proving the existence of PeVatrons within the Milky Way. In\nparticular, one of the detections was a 1.4 PeV photon in spatial\ncorrespondence with Cygnus OB2, providing a strong hint that young massive\nstellar clusters (YMSCs) can act as PeVatrons. The next-generation Cherenkov\ntelescopes will have unprecedented energy and angular resolution. Therefore,\nthey will be able to resolve spatially YMSCs better than LHAASO. We focused on\na sample of 5 YMSCs and their environments visible from either hemisphere with\nthe CTAO or ASTRI Mini-Array. We modeled the gamma-ray emission above 1 TeV. We\ndevised methods for classifying YMSCs that could be detected as unidentified\nextended TeV sources and estimated the observational time needed to distinguish\nthe morphology of different classes of sources. We study the morphology of the\nsources in our sample in order to identify the main features. We simulated\nobservations of all sources with the instrument response function (IRF) of CTAO\nor ASTRI Mini-Array. We compare their emission distribution to the one of the\nTeV halos observed by HAWC. We parametrize their radial profiles in order to\ndevelop methodologies to classify them and to distinguish YMSCs from TeV halos\nbased on their morphology. We expect some feature, such as the emission peak,\nto be key in differentiating between the two classes of objects. We then test\nthem on a sample of sources of the first LHAASO catalog."}

Observations from LHAASO (Large High Altitude Air Shower\nObservatory) have identified several PeVatron candidates, including some SNRs,\npulsar wind nebulae, TeV halos and young massive star clusters (YMSCs).

We simulate and model\nthe emission of TeV halos and YMSCs, adopting radial emission profiles derived\nfrom observational data. Given the current angular resolution of gamma-ray\ninstruments, these profiles often appear similar, making it challenging to\ndistinguish between source classes. We explore how next-generation Imaging\nAtmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), namely the CTAO (Cherenkov Telescope\nArray Observatory) and the ASTRI Mini-Array (Astrofisica con Specchi a\nTecnologia Replicante Italiana), can classify these sources based on their\nmorphology.

This has meant omitting much of the data during\ncosmological inference, or forward-modeling the spatial distribution of gas\naround dark matter halos using analytical or hydrodynamical models for baryonic\nfeedback, which introduces nuisance parameters and model dependence. We propose\na novel method of ``baryon nulling'' using cross-correlations between shear\nmaps and fast radio burst (FRB) dispersion measures. By directly subtracting\nthe dark matter--dispersion measure cross-correlation, the sensitivity of our\nnulled power spectra to feedback effects can be significantly reduced without\nany explicit feedback modeling. Using the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamic\nsimulations, whose power spectra span a wide yet realistic range of feedback\nvariations, we demonstrate that our method reduces sensitivity to feedback\nmodeling at $k \\approx 1$ Mpc$^{-1}$ by about an order of magnitude. This\npoints toward a strong synergy between the next generation of sensitive FRB\nsurveys such as CHORD and the DSA-2000, and cosmic shear surveys such as Rubin,\nEuclid, and Roman."}

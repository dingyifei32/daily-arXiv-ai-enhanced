During the\nobservations GX 349+2 was found mainly in the normal branch.

No variability of\npolarisation in time and flux has been observed, while an energy-resolved\nanalysis shows a complex dependence of polarisation on energy, as confirmed by\na spectropolarimetric analysis. Spectral modeling reveals a dominant disc\nblackbody component and a Comptonising emitting region, with evidence of a\nbroad iron line associated with a reflection component. Spectropolarimetric\nfits suggest differing polarisation properties for the disc and Comptonised\ncomponents, slightly favouring a spreading layer geometry. The polarisation of\nthe Comptonised component exceeds the theoretical expectations, but is in line\nwith the results for other Z-sources with similar inclination. A study of the\nreflection's polarisation is also reported, with polarisation degree ranging\naround 10% depending on the assumptions. Despite GX 349+2's classification as a\nSco-like source, these polarimetric results align more closely with the\nCyg-like system GX 340+0 of similar inclination.

We combine $N$-body dynamic models of realistic\ndense star clusters with cluster formation histories to estimate the merger\nrate distribution as a function of primary mass for merging BBHs formed in\nthese environments. It has been argued that dense star clusters -- most notably\nold globular clusters -- predominantly produce BBH mergers with primary masses\n$M_p\\approx30\\,M_{\\odot}$. We show that dense star clusters forming at lower\nredshifts -- and thus having higher metallicities -- naturally produce\nlower-mass BBH mergers. We find that cluster BBH mergers span a wide range of\nprimary mass, from about $6\\,M_{\\odot}$ to above $100\\,M_{\\odot}$, with a peak\nnear $8\\,M_{\\odot}$, reproducing the overall merger rate distribution inferred\nfrom gravitational wave detections. Our results show that most low-mass BBH\nmergers (about $95\\%$ with $M_p\\lesssim 20\\,M_{\\odot}$) originate in metal-rich\n($Z \\sim Z_{\\odot}$) dense star clusters, while more massive BBH mergers form\npredominately in metal-poor globular clusters. We also discuss the role of\nhierarchical mergers in shaping the BBH mass distribution.

The radio antennas\ndetect emissions from cosmic-ray-induced air showers, and their precise\norientation is essential for an accurate reconstruction of the air-shower\nproperties. This work presents a novel method to determine the orientation by\nanalyzing periodic variations of the Galactic background noise recorded by the\nantennas. In particular, we examine noise level variations correlated with the\nEarth's rotation and the apparent position of the Galactic Center. The method\ncan provide a potential alternative or augment GPS-based measurements of the\nalignment of radio antennas at the South Pole.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u94f6\u6cb3\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\u5468\u671f\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u5357\u6781IceTop\u539f\u578b\u7ad9\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5929\u7ebf\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347IceTop\u8868\u9762\u9635\u5217\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u786e\u5b9a\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5929\u7ebf\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfGPS\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5730\u7403\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u94f6\u6cb3\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u94f6\u6cb3\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\u5468\u671f\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u5929\u7ebf\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3aGPS\u6d4b\u91cf\u5929\u7ebf\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6216\u8865\u5145\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5357\u6781\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5929\u7ebf\u65b9\u5411\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this paper, we report for the first time on the\nthird IXPE observation, performed between 2022 July 9 and 12, during which IXPE\ndetected a linear polarization degree of $\\Pi_X=6\\pm2$ per cent at a\npolarization angle, measured east of north, of $\\Psi_X=143^\\circ\\pm11^\\circ$\nwithin the 2-8 keV X-ray band. The X-ray polarization angle and degree during\nthis observation are consistent with those obtained during the first two\nobservations. The chromaticity of the polarization across radio, optical, and\nX-ray bands is likewise consistent with the result from the simultaneous\ncampaigns during the first two observations. Furthermore, we present two types\nof models to explain the observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and\nenergy-resolved polarization: a synchrotron self-Compton model with an\nanisotropic magnetic field probability distribution in the emitting volume, as\nwell as an energy-stratified shock model. Our results support both the shock\nscenario as well as support that small levels of magnetic field anisotropy can\nexplain the observed polarization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u6b21\u62a5\u544a\u4e86Markarian 501 (Mrk 501)\u57282022\u5e747\u67089\u65e5\u81f312\u65e5\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u6b21IXPE\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u504f\u632f\u5ea6\u4e3a6\u00b12%\uff0c\u504f\u632f\u89d2\u4e3a143\u00b111\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u524d\u4e24\u6b21\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76Mrk 501\u7684X\u5c04\u7ebf\u504f\u632f\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u8f90\u5c04\u673a\u5236\u548c\u78c1\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528IXPE\u89c2\u6d4bMrk 501\uff0c\u5206\u6790X\u5c04\u7ebf\u504f\u632f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u540c\u6b65\u81ea\u5eb7\u666e\u987f\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u5c42\u6fc0\u6ce2\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684X\u5c04\u7ebf\u504f\u632f\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u4e4b\u524d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6fc0\u6ce2\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u78c1\u573a\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u6fc0\u6ce2\u573a\u666f\u548c\u5c0f\u5e45\u5ea6\u78c1\u573a\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u504f\u632f\u73b0\u8c61\u3002"}}

We present an event-level simultaneous maximum\nlikelihood analysis of tracks and cascades using IceCube data collected from\nApril 6, 2008 to May 23, 2022 to search the whole sky for neutrino sources and,\nusing a source catalog, for coincidence of neutrino emission with gamma-ray\nemission. This is the first time a simultaneous fit of different detection\nchannels is used to conduct a time-integrated all-sky scan with IceCube.\nCombining all-sky tracks, with superior pointing-power and sensitivity in the\nnorthern sky, with all-sky cascades, with good energy-resolution and\nsensitivity in the southern sky, we have developed the most sensitive\npoint-source search to date by IceCube which targets the entire sky. The most\nsignificant point in the northern sky aligns with NGC 1068, a Seyfert II\ngalaxy, which shows a 3.5$\\sigma$ excess over background after accounting for\ntrials. The most significant point in the southern sky does not align with any\nsource in the catalog and is not significant after accounting for trials. A\nsearch for the single most significant Gaussian flare at the locations of NGC\n1068, PKS 1424+240, and the southern highest significance point shows results\nconsistent with expectations for steady emission. Notably, this is the first\ntime that a flare shorter than four years has been excluded as being\nresponsible for NGC 1068's emergence as a neutrino source.

In recent years,\ntheorists have paid much attention to the final interior processes within\nmassive stars, as they can be essential for revealing neutrino-driven supernova\nmechanisms and other potential transients of massive star collapse. However, it\nis challenging to observe directly the last hours of a massive star before\nexplosion, since it is the supernova event that triggers the start of intense\nobservational study. Here we report evidence for a final phase of stellar\nactivity known as a ``shell merger'', an intense shell burning in which the\nO-burning shell swallows its outer C-/Ne-burning shell, deep within the\nprogenitor's interior moments before the supernova explosion. In the violent\nconvective layer created by the shell merger, Ne, which is abundant in the\nstellar O-rich layer, is burned as it is pulled inward, and Si, which is\nsynthesized inside, is transported outward. The remnant still preserves some\ntraces of such Ne-rich downflows and Si-rich upflows in the O-rich layer,\nsuggesting that inhomogeneous shell-merger mixing began just hours ($\\lesssim\n10^4$ s) before its gravitational collapse. Our results provide the first\nobservational evidence that the final stellar burning process rapidly alters\nthe internal structure, leaving a pre-supernova asymmetry.

Currently under peer review at A&A Letters", "summary": "In massive binary-star systems, supernova explosions can significantly alter\nthe orbit during the formation of compact objects. Some compact objects are\npredicted to form via direct collapse, a scenario with negligible mass loss and\nno baryonic ejecta emitted. In this scenario, most of the energy is released\nvia neutrinos, and any resulting natal kick arises from asymmetries in their\nemission. Here I investigate stellar collapse leading to binary black hole (BH)\nformation, with a focus on how the natal kick influences the\ngravitational-wave-driven merger time. Broadly, I find three regimes. For low\nnatal kicks, the effect on the time-to-coalescence is negligible. For moderate\nnatal kicks, if the binary remains bound, up to 50% of binary BHs experience a\ndecrease in their time-to-coalescence by more than an order of magnitude. For\nlarge natal kicks, although most binaries become unbound, those that remain\nbound may acquire retrograde orbits and/or lead to shorter time-to-coalescence.\nFor binary BH mergers, large natal kicks ($\\gtrsim100$ km/s) are hard to\nreconcile with both neutrino natal kicks and the complete collapse scenario.\nThis suggests that retrograde orbits and shortened merger times could only\narise in volatile BH formation scenarios or if spin-axis tossing is at work.\nConsequently, electromagnetic observations of BHs in massive star binaries\nwithin the Local Group offer a more effective means to probe the physics behind\ncomplete collapse. Another promising population for deciphering the complete\ncollapse scenario is that of massive, wide binaries. Although Gaia may help\nshed light on these systems, longer observational baselines will likely be\nneeded to fully understand the roles of neutrino natal kicks and stellar\ncollapse in BH formation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7206\u70b8\u5bf9\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f68\u9053\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8natal kick\u5bf9\u5408\u5e76\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540ckick\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u574d\u7f29\u573a\u666f\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7206\u70b8\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5f62\u6210\u53ca\u8f68\u9053\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fnatal kick\u5bf9\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5b8c\u5168\u574d\u7f29\u573a\u666f\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540cnatal kick\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f68\u9053\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5206\u4e3a\u4f4e\u3001\u4e2d\u3001\u9ad8\u4e09\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9\u5408\u5e76\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u4f4ekick\u5bf9\u5408\u5e76\u65f6\u95f4\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\uff1b\u4e2d\u7b49kick\u53ef\u80fd\u4f7f50%\u7684\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff1b\u9ad8kick\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f68\u9053\u9006\u884c\u6216\u66f4\u77ed\u5408\u5e76\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u4e0e\u5b8c\u5168\u574d\u7f29\u573a\u666f\u517c\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7535\u78c1\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u5bbd\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u5b8c\u5168\u574d\u7f29\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u57fa\u7ebf\u6765\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3natal kick\u548c\u6052\u661f\u574d\u7f29\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Models have been\nproposed to explain the periodicity using dynamical phenomena such as rotation,\nprecession or orbital motion. Polarization Position Angle (PA) of the bursts\ncan be used to distinguish and constraint the origin of the long term\nperiodicity of the FRB. We aim to study the PA variability on short (within an\nobservation) and long timescales (from observation to observation). We aim to\ncompare the observed PA variability with the predictions of various dynamical\nprogenitor models for the FRB. We use the calibrated burst dataset detected by\nuGMRT in Band 4 (650 MHz) which have been published in arXiv:2409.12584 . We\ntransform the PA measured at 650 MHz to infinite frequency such that PAs\nmeasured in different observations are consistent, and finally measure the\nchanges within and across active windows. We find that PA of the bursts vary\naccording to the periodicity of the source. We constrain the PA variability to\nbe within seven degrees on timescales less than four hours for all MJDs. In\naddition, we also tentatively note the PA measured at the same phase in the\nactive window varies from one cycle to another. Using the findings, we\nconstrain rotational, precession and binary progenitor models. Rotational model\npartially agrees with observed PA variability but requires further study to\nfully constrain. We robustly rule out all flavors of precessional models where\neither precession explains the periodicity of the FRB or the variability from\none cycle to another.

We find that strong transitions ($\\log(gf)>-1$) are in\ngood agreement with both experiments and semi-empirical calculations. For ions\nwith substantial experimental data, the computed opacities exhibit good\nagreement with prior calculations. By calibrating low-lying energy levels with\nexperimental data, we have identified 66,591 transitions with experimentally\ncalibrated wavelength information, rendering future lanthanide line\nidentifications through radiative transfer modeling feasible. In total, our\ncalculations encompass 28 ions, yielding 146,856 energy levels below the\nionization threshold and 28,690,443 transitions among these levels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5408\u5e76\u540e\u5343\u65b0\u661fAT2017gfo\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u5149\u8c31\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u9567\u7cfb\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u539f\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u8f6c\u79fb\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "GW170817\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u5343\u65b0\u661f\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u63ed\u793a\u4e86r-\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6838\u5408\u6210\u4ea7\u7269\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7b2c\u4e09\u5cf0\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u660e\u786e\u9274\u5b9a\uff0c\u539f\u5b50\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528FAC\u4ee3\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u539f\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5c40\u90e8\u4e2d\u5fc3\u52bf\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u6821\u51c6\u80fd\u7ea7\u3002", "result": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u534a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e8666,591\u6761\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u8dc3\u8fc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5343\u65b0\u661f\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u672a\u6765r-\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u9274\u5b9a\u3002"}}

When a\ngravitational-wave signal is magnified, it appears to have originated from a\ncloser, more massive system. Thus, high-mass outliers to the gravitational-wave\nsource population are often proposed as natural candidates for strongly lensed\nevents. However, when using a data-driven method for identifying population\noutliers, we find that high-mass outliers are not necessarily strongly lensed,\nnor will the majority of strongly-lensed signals appear as high-mass outliers.\nThis is both because statistical fluctuations produce a larger effect on\nobserved binary parameters than does lensing magnification, and because\nlensing-induced outliers must originate from intrinsically high-mass sources,\nwhich are rare. Thus, the appearance of a single lensing-induced outlier\nimplies the existence of many other lensed events within the catalog. We\nadditionally show that it is possible to constrain the strong lensing optical\ndepth, which is a fundamental quantity of our Universe, with the detection or\nabsence of high-mass outliers. However, constraints using the latest\ngravitational-wave catalog are weak$\\unicode{x2014}$we obtain an upper limit on\nthe optical depth of sources at redshift $1$ magnified by a factor of $5$ or\nmore of $\\tau(\\mu\\geq5,z=1)\\leq 0.035 \\unicode{x2014}$and future observing runs\nwill not make an outlier-based method competitive with other probes of the\noptical depth. Future work will investigate the ability of the full inferred\npopulation of compact binaries to inform the distribution of lenses in the\nUniverse, opening a unique opportunity to access the high-redshift Universe and\nconstrain cosmic structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u4f20\u64ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u88ab\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u653e\u5927\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5f02\u5e38\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u662f\u5f3a\u900f\u955c\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e14\u5f3a\u900f\u955c\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e5f\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u88ab\u900f\u955c\u653e\u5927\u540e\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6e90\u7fa4\u4f53\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a2\u7d22\u5b87\u5b99\u900f\u955c\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u7fa4\u4f53\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7edf\u8ba1\u6ce2\u52a8\u548c\u900f\u955c\u653e\u5927\u5bf9\u89c2\u6d4b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5f02\u5e38\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u5f3a\u900f\u955c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5173\u8054\u6027\u4e0d\u5f3a\uff0c\u4e14\u900f\u955c\u6548\u5e94\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u4fe1\u53f7\u8f83\u5c11\u3002\u521d\u6b65\u7ea6\u675f\u4e86\u5149\u5b66\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u679c\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u53cc\u661f\u7fa4\u4f53\u63a8\u65ad\u900f\u955c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a2\u7d22\u9ad8\u7ea2\u79fb\u5b87\u5b99\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u5b87\u5b99\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

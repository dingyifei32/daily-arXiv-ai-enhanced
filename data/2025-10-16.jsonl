Pal & R. Saha 2024) of\nusing ANNs to infer cosmological density parameters by determining optimal\narchitecture for varying synthetic Hubble data SNRs in estimating the density\nparameters $\\Omega_{m, 0}$ and $\\Omega_{\\Lambda, 0}$ across redshift values $z\n\\in [0, 1]$. To generate the synthetic data, this study randomly sampled\ninitial free parameter values at $z=0$ from theoretically motivated priors and\nevolved them backwards using the first Friedmann Equation to generate clean\n$H(z)$ curves. Then, this paper adds realistic noise of high, normal, and low\nSNR by sampling relative uncertainties from a Gaussian KDE on 47 real data\nobservations compiled by A. Bouali et al. (2023). In the end, this study found\nthat a RNN that uses BiLSTM is the most effective for high and normal SNR data\nacross four quantitative metrics. On the other hand, a combination of\nconvolution and recurrent layers that uses GRU performed the best for low SNR\ndata across the same four metrics. A comparison between the results of this\npaper's ANN predictions and those of ParamANN shows that all architectures\ntested in this paper regardless of training SNR are statistically consistent\nwithin 1 standard deviation of ParamANN. However, most ANN results are not\nstatistically consistent within 3 standard deviations of Planck Collaboration\net al. (2020), showing a significant difference between ANN and the more\ntraditional MCMC methods used by Planck collaboration."}

This systematic bias is largely uncorrected by the\ncommonly used mass-step correction, as progenitor age and host galaxy mass\nevolve very differently with redshift. After correcting for this age-bias as a\nfunction of redshift, the SN dataset aligns more closely with the w0waCDM model\nrecently suggested by the DESI BAO project from a combined analysis using only\nBAO and CMB data. This result is further supported by an evolution-free test\nthat uses only SNe from young, coeval host galaxies across the full redshift\nrange.

This feature\ngives rise to the MTI when the temperature gradient is aligned with the\ngravity, which occurs in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. Most previous linear\nanalyses of the MTI adopted a local, Boussinesq approach. However, the\nconduction length, which sets the characteristic length scale of the MTI, might\nbe a non-negligible fraction of the scale height in the ICM. We want to assess\nthe impact of locality assumptions on the linear physics of the MTI. Another\ngoal is to unveil the deeper connections between these global MTI modes and\ntheir MRI counterparts in accretion discs. Our third objective is to provide a\nnew benchmark against which any numerical code implementing the Braginskii heat\nflux in spherical geometry can be tested. We perform a global linear analysis\nof the MTI in a spherical stratified model of the ICM. We use a combination of\nanalytical results, corroborated by numerical results obtained with both a\npseudo-spectral solver and IDEFIX, to better explain the physics of the global\nMTI modes. We obtain scaling laws and approximate expressions for the growth\nrates of the global modes. We show that the associated functions are confined\nwithin an inner region, limited by a turning point, where the mode is allowed\nto grow. The most unstable local MTI modes correspond to the portion of the\nglobal mode localised near the turning point. This phenomenology is similar to\nthat of the global MRI modes. Finally, direct simulations successfully\nreproduce the global MTI modes and their growth rates, with errors smaller than\n1%. Overall, this study provides us with new insights on the linear theory of\nthe global MTI in the ICM, and a useful numerical test bench for any\nastrophysical fluid dynamics code embedding anisotropic heat flux."}

If the EP\nis violated, different tracers will undergo different accelerations in response\nto a uniform gravitational field, and this loss of universality manifests as a\ndipole with a characteristic $1/K$ scale dependence in the squeezed limit of\nthe bispectrum. In this work we show that such a violation can be identified\nwith a particular anti-symmetric {modulation} in the local cross-power spectrum\nof distinct tracers. Based on this observation, we propose to test the EP using\nquadratic estimators as a more practical alternative to the conventional\napproach of directly estimating the bispectrum. We apply our quadratic\nestimator to a DESI-like survey and forecast constraints on the overall\namplitude of EP violation. Including mildly nonlinear scales in our\nreconstruction ($k_\\mathrm{max}\\simeq0.15\\, h\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), we find\nthat our estimator is competitive with the more exhaustive direct bispectrum\napproach. This means surveys like DESI can already benefit from the quadratic\nestimator approach."}

We use simulations to develop a\nstrategy for identifying kilonova candidates observed by Rubin and processed by\nthe Fink broker. These candidates can be used as astrophysical triggers for a\ntargeted gravitational-wave search. We simulate kilonovae light-curves for the\nfirst year of Rubin with the latest observing strategy for the Wide-Fast-Deep\nand the Deep Drilling Fields.

Using archival\ndata from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and our proposed selection\ncriteria, we estimate a minimum contamination of at least 30 events per month\nfrom other transients and variables, even under our strictest selection\ncriteria.

Although the\nlamp-post model successfully explains the disk reflection component, it fails\nto address the origin of seed photons and the geometry of the hot corona,\nbecause this model simplistically treats the corona as a point-like source\ngenerating a cutoff powerlaw spectrum. In this paper, we make simulations on a\npossible physical realization of the lamp-post scenario: the shape of the\nscattering zone is set to be a cylinder, corresponding to the jet base near a\nBH. The source of seed photons in this system is assumed to be the multicolor\nblackbody radiation of the accretion disk. In our simulations, the Compton\nscattering process is simulated with a custom Monte Carlo program based on the\nGeant4 package and the disk reflection process is simulated with the xilconv\nmodel in XSPEC. Our simulation results have confirmed that the relativistic\nmotion of the jet can weaken or even completely suppress the reflection of the\naccretion disk, and simultaneously, the Comptonization of disk photons in the\njet can still make a major contribution to the observed X-ray spectrum in high\nenergy range.

Based on the latest catalog of\nEP-detected FXTs, we present, a model-independent, non-parametric approach to\nderive the luminosity function and formation rate of FXTs. Our analysis reveals\nsignificant cosmological luminosity evolution, characterized by a scaling\nrelationship of $(1+z)^{3.58}$. After accounting for this evolution, we\nestablish that the local luminosity function is best represented by a broken\npower law, with a break luminosity of $(4.17 \\pm 0.34) \\times 10^{46}$ erg/s.\nThe formation rate exhibits a gentle decline with redshift, following the\nrelation $(1+z)^{-0.21}$, yielding a local rate of approximately\n$28.0_{-16.4}^{+27.3}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. This rate is comparable to that of\nlow-luminosity long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs).

The burst properties and corresponding flux values suggest that\nmixed H/He burning may have fueled the bursts. We also detect evidence of a\nsoft excess during one burst, likely arising from the interaction of the burst\nphotons with the surroundings. We uncover evidence for a hard X-ray deficit\nduring the peak of all bursts and a hard lag of $\\sim4$ s, which can be\nattributed to the Compton cooling of the corona by the burst photons.

This\nreport covers solar cycles (SCs) 24 and 25 during which Fermi has been\noperating. Since SGRE events are closely related to solar energetic particle\n(SEP) events and interplanetary type II radio bursts caused by fast and wide\ncoronal mass ejections (CMEs), we consider these phenomena as well. Many\nstudies have shown that SC 25 is similar or slightly stronger than SC 24. The\nnumber of SEP events, GLE events, IP type II bursts, and fast and wide CMEs\nconfirm this conclusion. However, the number of SGRE events observed by Fermi\nLAT has diminished significantly in SC 25 relative to SC 24. One of the issues\nhas been the reduced coverage of the Sun since 2018 due to a mechanical problem\nwith a solar array of the Fermi mission.

We\npost-process the results with a time-dependent Monte Carlo radiation transport\ncode to extract observational signatures. The engine excavates a bubble at the\ncentre of the ejecta, which becomes Rayleigh-Taylor unstable. Sufficiently\npowerful engines are able to break through the edge of the bubble and\naccelerate, shred, and compositionally mix the entire ejecta. The breakout of\nthe engine-driven wind occurs at distinct rupture points, and the outflowing\nhigh-velocity gas may eventually give rise to radio emission. The dynamical\nimpact of the engine leads to faster rising optical light curves, with photon\nescape facilitated by the faster expansion of the ejecta and the opening of\nlow-density channels. For models with strong engines, the spectra are initially\nhot and featureless, but later evolve to resemble those of broad-line Ic\nsupernovae. Under certain conditions, line emission from ionized, low-velocity\nmaterial near the centre of the ejecta may be able to escape and produce narrow\nemission similar to that seen in interacting supernovae.

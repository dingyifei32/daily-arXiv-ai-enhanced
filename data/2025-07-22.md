TL;DR: 提出了一种新型混合粒子模拟方法，通过“假冲击”边界条件降低计算成本，同时保持与传统模拟相同的物理特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统冲击模拟计算成本高，难以长时间研究冲击前驱体物理。

Method: 使用“假冲击”边界条件模拟粒子与下游的散射，降低计算成本。

Result: 新方法能重现传统模拟的流体量和相空间特性，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来研究宇宙射线驱动的冲击前驱体不稳定性提供了高效可靠工具。

Abstract: We demonstrate a novel setup for hybrid particle-in-cell simulations designed
to isolate the physics of the shock precursor over long time periods for
significantly lower computational cost than previous methods. This is achieved
using a "faux-shock" or shock-like boundary condition on one edge of our
simulation domain such that particles that interact with the boundary either
pass through it or are reflected off of it with a change in momentum that
mimics scattering in the downstream. We show that our faux-shock setup
reproduces the same fluid quantities and phase spaces as traditional shock
simulations, including those which could otherwise only be done in 3D, with
higher particle resolution and for reduced computational cost. While the method
involves an assumed boundary condition, it nonetheless captures the essential
physics of interest, establishing it as a reliable and efficient tool for
future self-consistent studies of instabilities driven by cosmic rays in a
shock upstream medium.

Motivation: 探讨超新星爆炸后中子星与伴星相互作用的天体物理现象，解释观测到的奇特超新星SN2022jli的多重特征。

Method: 分析束缚轨道下中子星吸积气体的条件，研究内部激波将动能转化为辐射的过程，并模拟高能粒子和光子的产生。

Result: 发现中子星吸积在特定条件下必然发生，激波加热导致周期性光学发射，并产生高能伽马射线和中微子。模型成功解释了SN2022jli的观测特征。

Conclusion: 该模型为理解SN2022jli等奇特超新星提供了新视角，揭示了中子星与伴星相互作用的复杂物理过程。

Abstract: We study the observational signatures from the interactions between a newly
born neutron star and a companion star that is impacted by the supernova
ejecta. We focus on the cases with bound post-explosion orbits, where the
neutron star may periodically gravitationally capture gas from the companion.
We find that neutron star accretion must occur if the pre-supernova binary
separation is less than about 20 Rsun. This is because the stellar radius
expands beyond this radius before the shock-inflated envelope undergoes
Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction back to the main sequence. We then consider the
internal shocks formed between adjacent episodes of disk wind. The shocks
efficiently convert the wind kinetic energy into radiation (due to
inverse-Compton cooling), which heats up the supernova ejecta located at much
larger radii. The extra heating powers bright optical emission that is
periodically modulated on the orbital timescale. The shocks also accelerate
non-thermal particles which produce gamma-ray and neutrino emission from 100
MeV to 10 PeV via hardronic pp collisions. The high-energy photons leak out of
the supernova ejecta after a delay of several months to one year.
Photo-ionization of the slowest parts of the disk wind produces hydrogen
recombination lines. We then use the model to explain the puzzling Type Ic
supernova SN2022jli which shows a double-peaked optical lightcurve along with
many peculiar properties, including delayed onset and rapid shutoff of the
second peak, periodic modulations, delayed GeV emission, and narrow Balmer
lines. Under this model, SN2022jli had a close-by companion at a pre-supernova
binary separation of 10 to 20 Rsun, likely due to an earlier phase of
common-envelope evolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GRB 250702BDE的异常特性，以探索其可能的起源机制。

Method: 利用费米伽马射线暴监测器、爱因斯坦探针、VLT、MeerKAT和哈勃太空望远镜进行多波段观测。

Result: 发现GRB 250702BDE具有极红的红外对应体，爆发特征不符合已知模型，可能暗示周期性前身系统。

Conclusion: GRB 250702BDE可能源于非常规坍缩星或白矮星被中等质量黑洞潮汐撕裂的事件。

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are singular outbursts of high-energy radiation with
durations typically lasting from milliseconds to minutes and, in extreme cases,
a few hours. They are attributed to the catastrophic outcomes of stellar-scale
events and, as such, are not expected to recur. Here, we present observations
of an exceptional GRB\,250702BDE which triggered the {\em Fermi} gamma-ray
burst monitor on three occasions over several hours, and which was detected in
soft X-rays by the \textit{Einstein Probe} a day before the $\gamma$-ray
triggers (EP250702a). We present the discovery of an extremely red infrared
counterpart of the event with the VLT, as well as radio observations from
MeerKAT. Hubble Space Telescope observations pinpoint the source to a
non-nuclear location in a host galaxy with complex morphology, implying GRB
250702BDE is an extragalactic event. The multi-wavelength counterpart is well
described with standard afterglow models at a relatively low redshift $z \sim
0.2$, but the prompt emission does not readily fit within the expectations for
either collapsar or merger-driven GRBs. Indeed, a striking feature of the
multiple prompt outbursts is that the third occurs at an integer multiple of
the interval between the first two. Although not conclusive, this could be
indicative of periodicity in the progenitor system. We discuss several possible
scenarios to explain the exceptional properties of the burst, which suggest
that either a very unusual collapsar or the tidal disruption of a white dwarf
by an intermediate-mass black hole are plausible explanations for this
unprecedented GRB.

Motivation: 探索双爆轰模型（CO白矮星与薄氦层爆轰）产生的独特早期电磁信号，以更好地理解Ia型超新星的爆发机制。

Method: 通过分析双爆轰模型中CO爆轰与氦爆轰碰撞产生的三种电磁特征（冲击波突破闪光、平面冲击波冷却和冲击冷却辐射），并探讨重组效应对冲击冷却辐射的影响。

Result: 预测初始闪光（软X射线）持续约5秒，光度为6×10^43 erg/s；随后是12-24小时的冲击冷却（光学/紫外波段），光度为3-10×10^40 erg/s。

Conclusion: 双爆轰模型的早期电磁特征具有探测潜力，可为当前和未来的观测提供重要线索。

Abstract: A popular model for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is the detonation of a CO
white dwarf (WD) that is triggered by the prior detonation of a thin surface
layer of helium, known as a double detonation (DD). We explore the unique early
electromagnetic signatures that are expected from collision of the CO
detonation with the He detonation. The three features are (1) a shock breakout
flash, (2) a stage of planar shock breakout cooling, and finally (3) shock
cooling emission from the thermal energy released by the collision. The planar
phase is unique to the unusual density profile of the He-detonated layer in
comparison to the steep profile at a stellar edge as is usually considered for
shock breakout. The shock cooling emission can be modified by recombination,
and we explore these effects. All together, we expect an initial flash
dominated by the planar phase of $\sim6\times10^{43}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$, which
lasts ~5 s in the soft X-rays. This is followed by ~12-24 hrs of shock cooling
at a luminosity of $3-10\times10^{40}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$ in the optical/UV. We
discuss prospects for detection of this early DD emission with current and
upcoming surveys.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过X射线与光学数据的交叉匹配，识别光学对应体，并探索其变异性与X射线源的关系。

Method: 结合X射线源目录与DP1数据，计算匹配概率，分析X射线-光学通量比，并使用Stetson J变异性指数评估光学变异性。

Result: 匹配了2314个X射线源，可靠性因区域而异；未发现银河系吸积致密天体的强候选体；变异性分析结果不显著。

Conclusion: DP1数据在E-CDF-S区域可靠性高，但其他区域较低；X射线源的光学变异性证据不足。

Abstract: We present a crossmatch between a combined catalog of X-ray sources and the
Vera C. Rubin Observatory Data Preview 1 (DP1) to identify optical
counterparts. The six fields targeted as part of DP1 include the Extended
Chandra Deep Field South (E-CDF-S), the Euclid Deep Field South (EDF-S), the
Fornax Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy (Fornax dSph), 47 Tucanae (47 Tuc) and science
validation fields with low galactic and ecliptic latitude (SV\_95\_-25 and
SV\_38\_7, respectively). We find matches to 2314 of 3830 X-ray sources. We
also compare our crossmatch to DP1 in the E-CDF-S field to previous efforts to
identify optical counterparts. The probability of a chance coincidence match
varies across each DP1 field, with overall high reliability in the E-CDF-S
field, and lower proportion of high-reliability matches in the other fields.
The majority of previously known sources that we detect are, unsurprisingly,
active galaxies. We plot the X-ray-to-optical flux ratio against optical
magnitude and color in an effort to identify Galactic accreting compact objects
using a {\em Gaia} color threshold transformed to LSST $g$--$i$, but do not
find any strong candidates in these primarily extragalactic counterparts. The
DP1 dataset contains high-cadence photometry collected over a number of nights.
We calculate the Stetson \( J \) variability index for each object under the
hypothesis that X-ray counterparts tend to exhibit higher optical variability;
however, the evidence is inconclusive whether our sample is more variable over
DP1 timescales when compared to field objects.

### [6] [A new long period radio transient: Discovery of pulses repeating every 1.16 hours from ASKAP J175534.9-252749.1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14448)

TL;DR: 发现来自ASKAP J1755-2527的新脉冲，确认其为长周期瞬变源（LPT），周期约1.16小时。脉冲散射显著，与银河电子密度模型一致。部分脉冲的偏振行为异常，可能与旋转矢量模型不符。推测其可能为白矮星双星系统，但周期略短于典型激变变星的最小轨道周期。

Motivation: 研究ASKAP J1755-2527的脉冲特性，以确认其是否为长周期瞬变源，并探讨其可能的物理机制。

Method: 通过分析新发现的脉冲及其散射特性、偏振行为，结合历史未探测数据，推断其周期性及可能的物理模型。

Result: 确认J1755-2527为长周期瞬变源，周期约1.16小时；部分脉冲偏振行为异常；推测其可能为白矮星双星系统。

Conclusion: J1755-2527的发现强调了进一步观测对理解异常射电源的重要性，其特性可能挑战现有模型。

Abstract: We report the discovery of several new pulses from the source ASKAP
J175534.9-252749.1 (J1755-2527), originally identified from a single 2-min long
pulse, confirming it as a long period transient (LPT) with a period of ~1.16
hours. The pulses are significantly scattered, consistent with Galactic
electron density models. Two of the new pulses also had measurable
polarisation, but unlike the originally detected pulse, the polarisation angle
does not behave as expected from the rotating vector model. We interpret
historical non-detections of J1755-2527 as an intrinsic intermittency that
occurs on month-long timescales, and discuss possible causes. We conjecture
that, like some other LPTs with periods >~ 1 hour, J1755-2527 may host a white
dwarf in a binary orbit, but note that its period is marginally shorter than
the canonical orbital period minimum of cataclysmic variables. Our work
highlights the importance of additional observations in establishing the nature
of unusual radio-emitting objects.

Motivation: 精确测量大气μ子通量有助于理解宇宙射线相互作用和测试强子相互作用模型。

Conclusion: 研究为理解宇宙射线相互作用和强子模型提供了重要数据，并展示了机器学习在事件分析中的潜力。

Abstract: Atmospheric muons produced in cosmic-ray air showers are classified as
conventional muons from pion and kaon decays and prompt muons from heavy hadron
decays. Conventional muons dominate at lower energies, and the prompt component
becomes dominant at PeV energies and above. Precisely measuring the atmospheric
muon flux from a few GeV to several PeV is valuable for advancing our
understanding of cosmic-ray interactions and testing hadronic interaction
models. Low-energy muons that stop within the IceCube in-ice array provide
valuable information about the energy spectrum of muons from a few hundred GeV
up to 10 TeV. Machine learning techniques are employed to enhance event
reconstruction and selection to provide insights into the conventional and
prompt components. This contribution presents the unfolding of the energy
spectrum of stopping muons in IceCube as well as the unfolding of high-energy
muons to probe the prompt component.

Result: 发现氢包层质量在相同RSG光度下变化范围大，且几乎所有SNe II的氢包层质量低于标准恒星风模型的预测。

Conclusion: SNe II可能起源于多种质量损失历史和演化路径，其复杂性远超标准恒星演化模型的假设。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of 32 type II supernovae (SNe II) with
plateau phase photometry and late phase ($nebular$) spectroscopy available,
aiming to bridge the gap between the surface and core of their red supergiant
(RSG) progenitors. Using \texttt{MESA}\,+\texttt{STELLA}, we compute an
extensive grid of SN II light curve models originating from RSG with effective
temperatures $T_{\rm eff}$ around 3650\,K and hydrogen-rich envelopes
artificially stripped to varying degrees. These models are then used to derive
the hydrogen-rich envelope masses $M_{\rm Henv}$ for SNe II from their plateau
phase light curves. Nebular spectroscopy further constrains the progenitor
RSG's luminosity log\,$L_{\rm prog}$, and is employed to remove the
degeneracies in light curve modeling. The comparison between log\,$L_{\rm
prog}$-$M_{\rm Henv}$ reveals that $M_{\rm Henv}$ spans a broad range at the
same log\,$L_{\rm prog}$, and almost all SNe II have lower $M_{\rm Henv}$ than
the prediction of the default stellar wind models. We explore alternative wind
prescriptions, binary evolution models, and the possibility of more compact RSG
progenitors. Although binary interaction offers a compelling explanation for
the non-monotonicity and large scatter in the log\,$L_{\rm prog}$-$M_{\rm
Henv}$ relation, the high occurrence rate of partially-stripped RSGs cannot be
accounted for by stable binary mass transfer alone without fine-tuned orbital
parameters. This highlights that, despite being the most commonly observed
class of core-collapse SNe, SNe II likely originate from a variety of mass-loss
histories and evolutionary pathways that are more diverse and complex than
typically assumed in standard stellar evolution models.

Result: 检测到11,553次爆发，总能量超过典型磁星磁能的86%，并提供了磁矩的严格下限。

Conclusion: 磁星可能是FRB的高效引擎，但其模型可能需要调整以解释观测到的能量释放。

Abstract: Magnetars are widely considered to be the central engine of fast radio bursts
(FRBs), capable of driving coherent radio emission through magnetic energy
release. The accumulation of burst energy can be employed as a probe to reveal
the nature of FRB energy engine. Current observations of repeaters have not yet
provided sufficient constraints on the magnetic energy budget for magnetar
models. Here we report 11,553 bursts detected from the hyper-active repeating
source FRB 20240114A over 214 days during a recent active episode, with a peak
burst rate as high as 729 hr$^{-1}$, above the detection threshold of the
monitoring observations using Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio
Telescope (FAST). This represents the largest recorded burst sample from a
single FRB source, comprising more than four times as many bursts as any
previously known repeater and exceeding the cumulative total of all published
bursts to date. Assuming a typical value of radio efficiency of $10^{-4}$ and a
beaming factor of 0.1, the estimated total isotropic burst energy of this
source exceeds 86\% of the dipolar magnetic energy of a typical magnetar with a
polar surface magnetic field of $10^{15}$ G and a radius of $10^6$ cm. The
total energy release of this source is about one and a half orders of magnitude
higher than that of other known repeaters. We further provide the most
stringent lower limit of $\bf{4.7\times10^{32}}$ G cm$^3$ on the magnetic
moment of the underlying magnetar. The findings suggest that either the central
engine emits with exceptionally high radio efficiency, possesses a small
beaming factor, or it should be a more powerful compact object than typically
considered in current magnetar models.

Abstract: Despite growing efforts to find the sources of high energy neutrinos measured
by IceCube, the bulk of the neutrinos remain with unknown origins. We aim to
constrain the emissivity of cosmic high-energy neutrinos from extragalactic
sources through their correlation with the large-scale structure. We use
cross-correlations between the IceCube 10-year dataset and tomographic maps of
the galaxy overdensity to place constraints on the bias-weighted high-energy
neutrino emissivity out to redshift $z\sim3$. We test two different models to
describe the evolution of neutrino emissivity with redshift, a power law model
$\propto (1+z)^a$, and a model tracking the star formation history, assuming a
simple power law model for the energy injection spectrum. We also consider a
non-parametric reconstruction of the astrophysical neutrino emissivity as a
function of redshift. We do not find any significant correlation, with our
strongest results corresponding to a $1.9 \sigma$ deviation with respect to a
model with zero signal. We use our measurements to place upper bounds on the
bias-weighted astrophysical high-energy neutrino emission rate as a function of
redshift for different source models. This analysis provides a new probe to
test extragalactic neutrino source models. With future neutrino and galaxy
datasets we expect the constraining and detection power of this type of
analysis analysis to increase.

Abstract: Possible periodic features in fast radio bursts (FRBs) may provide insights
into their astrophysical origins. Using extensive observations from the
Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we conduct a
search for periodicity across multiple timescales in the exceptionally active
repeater source FRB 20240114A. A detailed analysis of 11,553 bursts reveals
three candidate periodic signals (3.4-6$\sigma$), with frequencies of
approximately 1.486 Hz, 1.576 Hz, and 1.865 Hz. This finding offers tentative
evidence for a potential association with magnetar spin, although further
studies are necessary for definitive confirmation. On longer timescales, a
67.5-69.2 day activity cycle is identified using two independent methods, with
a significance exceeding $3.5\sigma$. In the burst time series, quasi-periodic
oscillations (QPOs) in the range of a few hundred Hz are identified, with a
significance exceeding 5$\sigma$, and a strong correlation is found between
their central frequencies and widths (Pearson $R=0.97$). The decomposed
temporal profiles of these QPOs suggest an amplitude-modulated quasi-periodic
signal. The burst clusters manifest periodic burst trains ranging from a few
milliseconds to several tens of milliseconds, revealing transient periodic
characteristics. Despite the unprecedentedly large sample size from a single
repeating FRB source during a time-continuous active period, no stable periodic
signals are detected. Instead, there are multiple QPOs that dynamically evolve
over time. These results clarify the bias of previous studies that occasionally
detected QPOs believed to be potentially related to the spin of compact
objects.

Method: 开发了一个半解析模型，结合恒星演化和广义相对论模拟，计算SMS爆炸的冲击特性、光度、光谱和测光数据。

Result: SMS爆炸的光变曲线亮度可达10^45-47 erg/s，持续10-200年（考虑宇宙时间膨胀可达250-3000年），可被JWST、EUCLID和RST等望远镜观测到。

Conclusion: SMS爆炸可能是高红移SMBH形成的关键通道，未来望远镜观测有望验证这一理论并约束SMS形成率。

Abstract: Recently discovered supermassive black holes with masses of
$\sim10^8\,M_\odot$ at redshifts $z\sim9$-$11$ in active galactic nuclei (AGN)
pose severe challenges to our understanding of supermassive black hole
formation. One proposed channel are rapidly accreting supermassive PopIII stars
(SMSs) that form in large primordial gas halos and grow up to $<10^6\,M_\odot$.
They eventually collapse due to the general relativistic instability and could
lead to supernova-like explosions. This releases massive and energetic ejecta
that then interact with the halo medium via an optically thick shock. We
develop a semi-analytic model to compute the shock properties, bolometric
luminosity, emission spectrum and photometry over time. The initial data is
informed by stellar evolution and general relativistic SMS collapse
simulations. We find that SMS explosion light curves reach a brightness
$\sim10^{45\mathrm{-}47}\,\mathrm{erg/s}$ and last $10$-$200$ years in the
source frame - up to $250$-$3000$ years with cosmic time dilation. This makes
them quasi-persistent sources which vary indistinguishably to little red dots
and AGN within $0.5$-$9\,(1+z)$ yrs. Bright SMS explosions are observable in
long-wavelength JWST filters up to $z\leq20$ ($24$-$26$ mag) and pulsating SMSs
up to $z\leq15$. EUCLID and the Roman space telescope (RST) can detect SMS
explosions at $z<11$-$12$. Their deep fields could constrain the SMS rate down
to $10^{-11}$Mpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, which is much deeper than JWST bounds. Based
on cosmological simulations and observed star formation rates, we expect to
image up to several hundred SMS explosions with EUCLID and dozens with RST deep
fields.

Abstract: This study investigates the morphological classification and drifting rate
measurement of the repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source FRB20240114A using
the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). Detected on January
14, 2024, FRB20240114A showed an exceptionally high burst rate. During a
continuous 15,780-second monitoring session on March 12, 2024, 3,203 bursts
(2,109 burst-clusters) were detected. We refine the definitions of sub-bursts,
bursts, and burst-clusters. Using an average dispersion measure (DM) of 529.2
pc cm$^{-3}$, burst-clusters were classified into Downward Drifting, Upward
Drifting, No Drifting, No Evidence for Drifting, Not-Clear, and Complex
categories. Notably, 233 (23.82%) of the 978 drifting burst-clusters showed
upward drifting. Excluding 142 upward drifting single-component clusters, the
remaining 91 upward drifting double- or multiple-components clusters account
for 10.89% of the drifting sample. Further restricting to those with
consecutive time intervals, only 9 upward drifting bursts remain. An inverse
correlation is found between drifting rate and sub-burst effective width.
Upward drifting single-component clusters tend to have smaller effective
widths, bandwidths, and fluxes than downward drifting ones. For these upward
drifting clusters, drifting rate increases with peak frequency. A
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test reveals longer consecutive intervals in upward drifting
clusters compared to downward ones, suggesting differing underlying mechanisms.

Abstract: The landmark detection of both gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic
(EM) radiation from the binary neutron star merger GW170817 has spurred efforts
to streamline the follow-up of GW alerts in current and future observing runs
of ground-based GW detectors. Within this context, the radio band of the EM
spectrum presents unique challenges. Sensitive radio facilities capable of
detecting the faint radio afterglow seen in GW170817, and with sufficient
angular resolution, have small fields of view compared to typical GW
localization areas. Additionally, theoretical models predict that the radio
emission from binary neutron star mergers can evolve over weeks to years,
necessitating long-term monitoring to probe the physics of the various
post-merger ejecta components. These constraints, combined with limited radio
observing resources, make the development of more coordinated follow-up
strategies essential -- especially as the next generation of GW detectors
promise a dramatic increase in detection rates. Here, we present RADAR, a
framework designed to address these challenges by promoting community-driven
information sharing, federated data analysis, and system resilience, while
integrating AI methods for both GW signal identification and radio data
aggregation. We show that it is possible to preserve data rights while sharing
models that can help design and/or update follow-up strategies. We demonstrate
our approach through a case study of GW170817, and discuss future directions
for refinement and broader application.

<details>

Motivation: HLXs可能是中等质量黑洞的候选体，但现有样本中可能存在污染源，需进一步纯化和分析。

Method: 从115个XMM-Newton检测的HLXs中去除污染源（如AGNs、X射线扩散发射等），对剩余的40个源进行光谱拟合和硬度-光度图分析。

Result: 纯化后的HLX样本光度范围广（1×10^41至10^43 erg s^-1），硬度均匀分布，部分源硬度高于典型AGN，发现4个软谱异常源。

Conclusion: HLXs比ULXs更具多样性，但现有数据难以明确区分其类型，需进一步观测以揭示其本质。

Abstract: Ultraluminous and hyperluminous X-ray sources (ULXs and HLXs) are among the
brightest astrophysical objects in the X-ray sky. While ULXs most likely host
stellar-mass compact objects accreting at super-Eddington rates, HLXs are
compelling candidates for accreting intermediate-mass black holes. Our goal is
to produce a clean sample of HLXs by removing possible contaminants and
characterise the spectral properties of the remaining population. Starting with
a set of 115 HLXs detected by XMM-Newton, we identified and removed
contaminants (AGNs, X-ray diffuse emission detected as point-like, and tidal
disruption event candidates) and retrieved 40 sources for which XMM-Newton
spectra are available. We fitted them with an absorbed power law model and
determined their unabsorbed luminosities and hardness ratios. We constructed
the hardness-luminosity diagram, compared the results with the spectral
properties of the HLX prototype, ESO 243-49 HLX-1, and conducted a deeper
analysis on a few promising candidates. The resulting HLX population spans a
luminosity range from $1\times10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to nearly $10^{43}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ and is homogeneously spread in hardness between 0.5 and 5. Half of the
population has hardness ratios higher than a typical AGN, and could be
considered the extension of the ULX population at higher energies. We found
four very soft outliers, which are characterised by steep power law spectra and
no X-ray emission above 1$-$2 keV, similarly to ESO 243-49 HLX-1. Those with
multi-epoch archival data show changes in luminosity up to almost two orders of
magnitudes. We show that sources currently identified as HLXs can be more
diverse than ULXs and disentangling between different types of objects is not
trivial with currently available data. New observations would be beneficial to
expand the current sample and uncover the true nature of many objects of this
class.

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts observed in high-energies allow the investigation of the

model the energetics, jet structure, variability, and opening angle of the
burst to understand its underlying physical conditions. We tested the 2D and 3D
models and estimated the time scale of variability. The predicted energetics
and the jet opening angle reconcile with the observed ones with 1$\sigma$ when
considering that the jet opening angles also evolve with redshift. Furthermore,
we extend our analysis by incorporating dynamical ejecta into selected models
to study its impact on jet collimation at smaller distances. In addition, we
investigated a suite of models exhibiting a broad range of observable GRB
properties, thereby extending our understanding beyond this specific event.

Result: IceCube升级将显著提升对3 GeV至500 GeV质量范围内DM-质子散射截面的探测灵敏度。

Conclusion: IceCube升级将成为3 GeV至10 TeV质量范围内最灵敏的间接探测实验。

Abstract: While astrophysical observations imply that 85% of the matter content is
unaccounted for, the nature of this dark matter (DM) component remains unknown.
Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) - DM particles that interact at or
below the weak interaction scale - could naturally explain this missing matter.
These interactions with the Standard Model (SM) allow them to be
gravitationally captured in celestial bodies like the Sun. Trapped DM in the
solar core could subsequently annihilate, producing stable SM particles, of
which only neutrinos can escape the Sun's dense interior. Therefore, an excess
of neutrinos originating from the direction of the Sun would serve as evidence
of DM. The IceCube Upgrade, a dense infill of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory,
will lower the energy threshold and improve sensitivity in the range from 1 to
500 GeV, thereby enhancing IceCube's ability to detect GeV-scale DM. In this
contribution, I present projections of the IceCube Upgrade's sensitivity to the
DM-proton scattering cross section for DM masses between 3 GeV and 500 GeV.
These sensitivities position IceCube as the most sensitive indirect detection
experiment for DM in the mass range from 3 GeV to 10 TeV.

Conclusion: 研究为未来CTA观测提供了关键目标，并解决了部分耀变体红移缺失的问题。

Abstract: Blazars, including BL Lacs and FSRQs, are the most luminous extragalactic
{\gamma}-ray sources. They account for about 56% of the sources listed in the
recent Fermi-LAT catalog (4FGL-DR4). The optical and UV spectra of BL Lacs are
nearly featureless, making it difficult to precisely determine their redshifts.
Consequently, nearly half of the {\gamma}-ray BL Lacs lack reliable redshift
measurements. This poses a major challenge, since redshift is crucial for
studying the cosmic evolution of the blazar population and {\gamma}-ray
propagation studies such as indirect evidence of EBL, placing constraints on
IGMF and searches for LIV and ALPs. This paper is the fourth in a series
dedicated to determining the redshift of a sample of blazars identified as key
targets for future observations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory
(CTAO). We performed Monte Carlo simulations to select {\gamma}-ray blazars
detected by Fermi-LAT with hard spectra, that lack redshift measurements. These
blazars are expected to be detectable by CTAO within 30 hours or less of
exposure assuming an average flux state. In this fourth paper, we report the
results of detailed spectroscopic observations of 29 blazars using the ESO/VLT,
Keck II, and SALT telescopes. Our analysis involved a thorough search for
spectral lines in the spectra of each blazar, and when features of the host
galaxy were identified, we modeled its properties. We also compared the
magnitudes of the targets during the observations to their long-term light
curves. In the sample studied, 9 of 29 sources were observed with a high
signal-to-noise ratio (S/N > 100), while the remaining 20 were observed with a
moderate or low S/N. We successfully determined firm redshifts for 12 blazars,
ranging from 0.1636 to 1.1427, and identified two lower limit redshifts at z >
1.0196 and z > 1.4454. The remaining 15 BL Lac objects exhibited featureless
spectra.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于连续引力波（CW）信号微弱且计算需求高，传统方法效率低。随机引力波背景（SGWB）搜索成本较低但灵敏度不足，因此提出混合方法以提高效率。

Method: 使用PyStoch工具进行SGWB分析作为初步筛选，随后用5-向量重采样和频带采样数据频率-Hough技术跟进显著候选信号。

Result: 在LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA的O3观测数据中未发现显著CW候选信号，但为四个超新星遗迹设定了95%置信水平的CW应变振幅上限。

Conclusion: 混合方法展示了SGWB分析在CW搜索中的潜力，尽管未发现信号，但为未来研究提供了上限参考。

Abstract: Detecting continuous gravitational waves (CWs) is challenging due to their
weak amplitude and high computational demands, especially with poorly
constrained source parameters. Stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB)
searches using cross-correlation techniques can identify unresolved
astrophysical sources, including CWs, at lower computational cost, albeit with
reduced sensitivity. This motivates a hybrid approach where SGWB algorithms act
as a first-pass filter to identify CW candidates for follow-up with dedicated
CW pipelines.
  We evaluated the discovery potential of the SGWB analysis tool PyStoch for
detecting CWs, using simulated signals from spinning down NSs. We then applied
the method to data from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O3), covering
the (20-1726) Hz frequency band, and targeting four supernova remnants: Vela
Jr., G347.3-0.5, Cassiopeia A, and the NS associated with the 1987A supernova
remnant. If necessary, significant candidates are followed up using the
5-vector Resampling and Band-Sampled Data Frequency-Hough techniques. However,
since no interesting candidates were identified in the real O3 analysis, we set
95\% confidence-level upper limits on the CW strain amplitude $h_0$. The most
stringent limit was obtained for Cassiopeia A, and is $h_0 = 1.13 \times
10^{-25}$ at $201.57$ Hz with a frequency resolution of $1/32$ Hz. As for the
other targets, the best upper limits have been set with the same frequency
resolution, and correspond to $h_0 = 1.20 \times 10^{-25} $ at $202.16$ Hz for
G347.3-0.5, $1.20 \times 10^{-25}$ at $217.81$ Hz for Vela Jr., and $1.47
\times 10^{-25}$ at $186.41$ Hz for the NS in the 1987A supernova remnant.

Conclusion: 研究展示了AI方法的预测能力，但需更高统计量的观测数据验证候选PULXs的脉冲信号。

Abstract: The discovery of fast and variable coherent signals in a handful of
ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) testifies to the presence of super-Eddington
accreting neutron stars, and drastically changed the understanding of the ULX
class. Our capability of discovering pulsations in ULXs is limited, among
others, by poor statistics. However, catalogues and archives of high-energy
missions contain information which can be used to identify new candidate
pulsating ULXs (PULXs). The goal of this research is to single out candidate
PULXs among those ULXs which have not shown pulsations due to an unfavourable
combination of factors. We applied an AI approach to an updated database of
ULXs detected by XMM-Newton. We first used an unsupervised clustering algorithm
to sort out sources with similar characteristics into two clusters. Then, the
sample of known PULX observations has been used to set the separation threshold
between the two clusters and to identify the one containing the new candidate
PULXs. We found that only a few criteria are needed to assign the membership of
an observation to one of the two clusters. The cluster of new candidate PULXs
counts 85 unique sources for 355 observations, with $\sim$85% of these new
candidates having multiple observations. A preliminary timing analysis found no
new pulsations for these candidates. This work presents a sample of new
candidate PULXs observed by XMM-Newton, the properties of which are similar (in
a multi-dimensional phase space) to those of the known PULXs, despite the
absence of pulsations in their light curves. While this result is a clear
example of the predictive power of AI-based methods, it also highlights the
need for high-statistics observational data to reveal coherent signals from the
sources in this sample and thus validate the robustness of the approach.

Conclusion: 湍流是GRB喷流光球层辐射谱形成Band-like谱的关键机制之一。

Abstract: The prompt $\gamma$-rays of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) may originate from the
photosphere of a relativistic jet. However, only a few GRBs have been observed
with evident blackbody-like emission, for example, GRB~090902B. It has been
demonstrated that internal dissipation processes, such as magnetic
reconnection, can occur within the relativistic jet and thereby drive violent
turbulence in the dissipation region. In this paper, we study the photospheric
emission of a jet with turbulence below its photosphere. Here, the turbulence
is modeled phenomenological under the assumption that the four-velocity of its
eddies follows a Gaussian distribution in the jet's co-moving frame. It is
found that the turbulence scatters photons to high energies and thus
intensifies the emission in the high-energy regime. The corresponding
distortion of the radiation field can be preserved if and only if the
turbulence occurs in a region with incomplete photon-electron coupling.
Consequently, the observed radiation spectrum can be reshaped into a Band-like
spectrum.

but currently we know less than 100 objects. We also know $\sim 100$
stellar-mass black holes in other galaxies, most of them discovered by

holes is indeed extremely challenging and possible only in very special cases.

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts are expected to be generated by structured jets, whose
profiles significantly impact their afterglow emission. Previously, we
developed a numerical code jetsimpy, to model the afterglow of jets with
arbitrary angular profiles. In this study, we extend the code to incorporate a
stratified radial profile, enabling it to model jets with arbitrary
axisymmetric two-dimensional structures. The radial profile leads to the
formation of a reverse shock. We modeled the shock system using an energy
conservation prescription, which differs from the pressure balance approach.
This leads to remarkably different predictions for reverse shock emission. In
particular, we find that the reverse shock emission in the thin shell case is
significantly overestimated in analytic models. We also explore the off-axis
reverse shock emission from structured jets, where the cores belong to thick
shell cases and the wings belong to thin shell cases. We have confirmed the
prediction that off-axis observers may see a thin-to-thick transition, but we
find that the light curve morphology is hard to distinguish from pure thin or
thick shell cases. A radial profile also introduces hydrodynamic energy
injection. As such, our code can naturally apply to refreshed shock cases,
where the modeling of kilonova afterglows is demonstrated as an example. To
validate our method, we fit the optical flash of GRB 990123, showing good
agreement with the data. The upgraded jetsimpy provides unprecedented
flexibility in modeling the afterglow emission of jets with various profiles,
including those derived from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
simulations.

Conclusion: LPTs和白矮星双星脉冲星可能是同一类磁化白矮星双星的不同演化阶段，支持统一的射电发射机制。

Abstract: Long-period radio transients (LPTs) represent a recently uncovered class of
Galactic radio sources exhibiting minute-to-hour periodicities and highly
polarised pulses of second-to-minute duration. Their phenomenology does not fit
exactly in any other class, although it might resemble that of radio magnetars
or of white dwarf (WD) radio emitting binary systems. Notably, two LPTs with
confirmed multi-wavelength counterparts have been identified as synchronised
white dwarf-M dwarf binaries (polars). Meanwhile, systems such as AR Scorpii
and J1912-44 exhibit short-period pulsations in a hr-tight orbit, with
polarized radio emission proposed to be generated by the interaction of the WD
magnetosphere with the low-mass companion wind.
  Here we demonstrate that both LPTs and WD binary pulsars can be explained
within a single geometric model in which radio emission is triggered when the
magnetic pole of a rotating white dwarf intersects its companion's wind in the
binary orbital plane. We use a 36-year timing baseline to infer the orbital
period and binary geometry solely from radio data of GPM J1839-10, the
longest-active LPT known. The model naturally predicts its intermittent
emission and double-pulse structure. Crucially, we show that the beat period
between the spin and the orbit matches the observed pulse substructure and
polarisation signatures, providing strong support for the model. Applying this
model to the WD binary pulsar J1912-44, it can also reproduce the system
emission and geometry. Our results place GPM J1839-10, and other LPTs in
general and radio emitting WD binaries, at different stages of a continuum
between intermediate and synchronised polars, suggesting a unified population
of magnetic WD binaries driving coherent radio emission.

Abstract: The launch of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), the first
space-based polarimeter since 1978, offers a two order of magnitude improvement
to the measurement of X-ray polarisation than its predecessor OSO-8, offering
unprecedented precision for the measurement of polarisation degree and
polarisation angle of X-ray sources. This advancement lends itself to the birth
of a number of contemporary techniques to study Galactic compact objects,
including X-ray polarimetry-timing, the study of how polarisation properties
evolve over short timescales. However, the statistical nature of polarisation
measurements poses a challenge for studies on arbitrarily short timescales, as
a large number of photons are required to achieve statistically significant
measurements of polarisation degree and angle for time-resolved analyses.
Furthermore, if the polarisation variability is stochastic, then phase-folding
techniques introduce systematic errors in the phase assignment of photons.
Ingram and Maccarone presented a model independent Fourier-based technique that
circumvents these issues. It can be used on arbitrarily short timescales for
any kind of variability, whether aperiodic, quasi-periodic or purely periodic.
Here we implement this method on real IXPE data. We address several
instrumental effects and test the technique on X-ray pulsars, RX-J0440.9+4431
and Hercules X-1 . We verify that our technique recovers the polarisation
variability signal that we already know to be there from typical phase-folding
techniques. It will now be possible to study fast stochastic polarisation
variability of X-ray sources, with applications including quasi-periodic
oscillations, mass accretion rate fluctuations, and reverberation mapping.

Result: 模拟结果显示，扭曲磁场能解释观测到的伽马射线谱，且在30-100 GeV范围内出现亮度增强，表明光球层/色球层的强扭曲增强了粒子约束。

Conclusion: 开放磁场线的扭曲结构对伽马射线辐射的产生有重要影响，尤其在光球层/色球层区域，强扭曲导致粒子约束增强，从而影响伽马射线谱。

Abstract: Gamma-ray emission in the GeV-TeV range from the solar disk is likely to
arise from collisions of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) with solar atmospheric
plasma. In a previous study, we demonstrated that closed turbulent magnetic
arcades trap efficiently GCRs leading to a gamma-ray flux consistent with the
Fermi-HAWC observations (from $\sim 0.1$ GeV to $\sim 1$ TeV). Here, we model a
synthetic magnetic field with a static, laminar structure of open field lines
in the chromosphere increasingly braiding near the solar surface, with a scale
height of $\sim 10^{-2} R_\odot$. The height-dependent increase in magnetic
field line braiding is modulated by an exponential scalar function, mimicking
the bending of the photo- and chromo-spheric magnetic field revealed by
polarimetric observations and reproduced by MHD simulations. Employing 3D
test-particle numerical simulations, we investigate how distorted magnetic
field lines affect the gamma-rays production by injecting GeV-TeV protons into
both magnetically laminar and braided regions. We find that with the chosen
spatial resolution this synthetic magnetic field can account for the $> 10$ GeV
gamma-ray spectrum observed by Fermi-LAT/HAWC. A rebrightening between
approximately $30$ and $100$ GeV (following a $\sim 30$ GeV spectral dip),
suggests an enhanced confinement within the photo-/chromospheric layer by a
stronger braiding.

Result: 在事件中间阶段（发现后172至212天）检测到显著的蓝移吸收特征，UFOs速度从0.19c降至0.0097c，速度与电离参数呈反相关。

Conclusion: UFOs的延迟出现可能与风开口角增大或金属（如铁和氧）富集有关，挑战了传统辐射压力驱动风的模型。

Abstract: We report the detection and characterization of ultrafast outflows (UFOs) in
the X-ray spectra of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2020afhd, based on
observations from NICER, Swift, and XMM. Prominent blueshifted absorption
features were detected exclusively during the intermediate phase of the event,
occurring between days 172 and 212 within the first 300 days post-discovery.
During this period, the UFO appeared no earlier than day 74, strengthened
between days 172 and 194, and disappeared after day 215. This marks the first
time that the full evolutionary sequence of X-ray outflows has been observed in
a TDE. Moreover, the outflows exhibited a dramatic deceleration from ~0.19c to
~0.0097c over a span of approximately 10 days. Photoionization spectral
analysis reveals an inverse correlation between outflow velocity and ionization
parameter, in contradiction to the predictions from radiation pressure-driven
wind. Eventually, we propose that the delayed onset of the outflows may result
from an increase in the wind opening angle and/or metal enrichment,
particularly iron and oxygen, during the disk formation phase.

Motivation: 近年来，越来越多的Ia型超新星在爆炸后不久被发现，其中一部分表现出早期超额辐射（EExSNe Ia），需要系统研究其早期光变行为。

Method: 通过分析67颗早期正常SNe Ia的观测数据，比较EExSNe Ia和非EExSNe Ia的光度和颜色演化。

Result: EExSNe Ia具有更长的上升时间、更亮的峰值光度，并在早期B-V颜色中表现出“红凸起”特征。

Conclusion: 薄氦双爆轰模型可以统一解释正常SNe Ia的多样性，未来需通过新一代广域时域巡天设施进一步验证。

Abstract: In recent years, with an increasing number of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia)
discovered soon after their explosions, a non-negligible fraction of SNe Ia
with early-excess emissions (EExSNe Ia) have been confirmed. In this letter, we
present a total of \textbf{67} early-phase normal SNe Ia from published papers
and ongoing transient survey projects to systematically investigate their
photometric behaviors from very early time. We found that EExSNe Ia in our
sample have longer rise and brighter peak luminosities compared to those of
non-EExSNe Ia. Moreover, EExSNe Ia commonly have ``red-bump" features in the
early $B-V$ color while non-EExSNe Ia show blueward evolution from the very
beginning. Here, we propose that the thin-helium double-detonation scenario can
phenomenologically explain the photometric diversities of normal SNe Ia
considering different white dwarf-He-shell mass combinations and the
viewing-angle effect, implying a unified explosion mechanism of normal-type SNe
Ia. To further testify the possible common origin of normal SNe Ia,
systematical studies of multiband photometric and spectral properties of
early-phase SNe Ia through the new generation wide-field time-domain survey
facilities and global real-time follow-up networks are highly demanded.

Result: 首次观测到具有不对称方位结构的TGFs，表明源结构比最初假设的向下束流更为复杂。

Conclusion: 结合新仪器和全球闪电网络数据，未来研究将进一步揭示TGFs的产生机制和雷电发展过程。

Abstract: Downward Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs) are sub-millisecond bursts of
MeV gamma rays produced in thunderclouds. According to the Relativistic Runaway
Electron Avalanche model, gamma rays are produced, via bremsstrahlung, from
electron cascades activated by a relativistic "seed" electron. It is not clear
what mechanism is responsible for the acceleration of electrons to relativistic
energies in electric discharges. To better understand the acceleration sites
and the TGF production mechanisms, it is critically important to identify the
TGF source position and geometry in the atmosphere and to study the gamma
emission characteristics. The Surface Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory,
with its 1600 water-Cherenkov detectors very sensitive to high-energy photons
and with a very fine time-sampling, is a valuable instrument to study downward
TGFs. The possibility to analyze the radiation emission in detail led to the
observation of the first TGFs with an asymmetric azimuthal structure,
suggesting a complex source different from the initially hypothesized downward
beam. We report on these observations and the new perspectives which may open
with the incorporation of new instruments at the Auger site to study lightning
development alongside gamma emission, and the increasingly detailed data
provided by satellites and global lightning networks.

Result: 抑制模型显著优于无抑制模型（置信度>99.5%），且存在特征（置信度95%）。

Conclusion: 双黑洞质量分布存在特征性峰值与缺失，可能与主次质量相关性有关。

Abstract: The mass distribution of binary black holes inferred from gravitational wave
measurements is expected to shed light on their formation scenarios. An
emerging structure in the mass distribution indicates the presence of multiple
peaks around chirp masses of $8M_\odot$, $14M_\odot$, and $27M_\odot$. In
particular, there is a lack of observations between chirp masses of 10 and 12
$M_\odot$. In this letter, we report that observations significantly favour the
model supporting suppression of the rate in a narrow chirp mass range compared
to the model that doesn't include suppression at a confidence greater than
99.5\%. Using another test, which measures the deviation between the inferred
chirp mass distributions from the two models, we conservatively estimate a 95\%
confidence in the presence of a feature. A lack of confidence has been reported
in the presence of a gap around a comparable location in the component mass
distribution. The differing conclusions are due to a unique correlation between
the primary~(heavier of the two masses) and the secondary~(lighter of the two
masses) masses of binary black holes. This correlation results in increased
clustering of measured chirp masses around specific values.

Conclusion: ULX脉冲星的吸积机制和伴星性质可能与本地X射线脉冲星不同。

Abstract: A fraction of the Ultra Luminous X-ray (ULX) sources are known to be
accreting neutron stars as they show coherent X-ray pulsations with pulse
periods ranging from ~1-30 seconds. While initially thought to host
intermediate-mass black holes, ULXs have since been recognized as a diverse
class of objects, including ULX pulsars. These pulsars require models
specifically tailored to account for their unique accretion physics, distinct
from those used for Galactic black hole binaries. The X-ray spectra of all
Galactic accreting X-ray pulsars (including sources in the Magellanic Clouds)
are dominated by a high energy cut-off power-law and some of the sources show a
soft excess, some emission lines, cyclotron absorption features, etc. In this
work, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of the broadband X-ray spectra of
five ULX pulsars using simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations and show
that their X-ray spectra can be effectively described by spectral models,
similar to those used for the local accretion-powered X-ray pulsars. A soft
excess is detected in all the sources which is also consistent with the local
X-ray pulsars that have low absorption column density. We have marginal
detection or low upper limit on the presence of the iron K-alpha emission line
from these sources, which is a key difference of the ULX pulsars with the local
accreting X-ray pulsars. We discuss the implication of this on the nature of
the binary companion and the accretion mechanism in the ULX pulsars.

Abstract: The origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs), the brightest cosmic radio
explosions, is still unknown. Bearing critical clues to FRBs' origin, the
long-term evolution of FRBs has yet to be confirmed, since the field is still
young and most FRBs were seen only once. Here we report clear evidence of
decadal evolution of FRB~20121102A, the first precisely localized repeater. In
conjunction with archival data, our FAST and GBT monitoring campaign since 2020
reveals a significant 7% decline of local dispersion measure (DM). The rotation
measure (RM) of 30,755$\pm$16 $\mathrm{rad\,m^{-2}}$ detected in the last epoch
represents a 70% decrease compared to that from December 2016. The
$\sigma_{RM}$ parameter, which describes the complexity of the magneto-ionic
environment surrounding the source, was shown to have decreased by 13%. These
general trends reveal an evolving FRB environment, which could originate from
an early-phase supernova associated with an enhanced pair wind from the FRB
central engine.

Conclusion: 新方法在保持高保真度的同时，解决了高多重性条件下的计算问题，结果与PIC研究一致，并为脉冲星射电辐射机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Recent developments in the study of pulsar radio emission revealed that the
microphysics of quantum electrodynamic (QED) pair cascades at pulsar polar caps
may be responsible for generating the observed coherent radio waves. However,
modeling the pair cascades in the polar cap region poses significant
challenges, particularly under conditions of high plasma multiplicity.
Traditional Particle-in-Cell (PIC) methods often face rapidly increasing
computational costs as the multiplicity grows exponentially. To address this
issue, we present a new simulation code using the Vlasov method, which
efficiently simulates the evolution of charged particle distribution functions
in phase space without a proportional increase in computational expense at high
multiplicities. We apply this code to study $e^\pm$ pair cascades in 1D,
incorporating key physical processes such as curvature radiation, radiative
cooling, and magnetic pair production. We study both the Ruderman-Sutherland
(RS) and the Space-charge-limited Flow (SCLF) regimes, and find quasiperiodic
gap formation and pair production bursts in both cases. These features produce
strong electric field oscillations, potentially enabling coherent low-frequency
radio emission. We construct a unified analytic model that describes the key
features of the polar cap cascade, which can be used to estimate the return
current heating rate that can be used to inform X-ray hotspot models. Spectral
analysis shows that a significant amount of energy is carried in superluminal
modes -- collective excitations that could connect to observed radio features.
Our results align with previous PIC studies while offering enhanced fidelity in
both dense and rarefied regions.

Abstract: We present the joint modelling of weak-lensing and count measurements of the
galaxy clusters detected with the AMICO code, in the fourth data release of the
Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS-1000). The analysed sample comprises about 8000
clusters, covering an effective area of 839 deg$^{2}$ and extending up to a
redshift of $z = 0.8$. Stacked cluster weak-lensing and count measurements have
been derived in bins of redshift and intrinsic richness, $\lambda^*$. Based on
self-organising maps, we reconstructed the true redshift distributions of the
background galaxy samples. We accounted for the systematic uncertainties
arising from impurities in the background and cluster samples, biases in the
cluster $z$ and $\lambda^*$, projection effects, halo orientation and
miscentring, truncation of cluster halo mass distributions, matter correlated
with cluster haloes, multiplicative shear bias, baryonic matter, geometric
distortions in the lensing profiles, uncertainties in the theoretical halo mass
function, and super-sample covariance. We also employed a blinding strategy
based on perturbing the cluster sample completeness. The improved statistics
and photometry compared to the previous KiDS data release, KiDS-DR3, have led
to a halving of the uncertainties on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$, as we
obtained $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.22\pm0.02$ and $\sigma_8=0.86\pm0.03$. The
constraint on $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5}$,
$S_8=0.74\pm0.03$, is in excellent agreement with recent cluster count and
KiDS-1000 cosmic shear analyses, while it shows a $2.8\sigma$ tension with
Planck cosmic microwave background results. The constraints on the
$\log\lambda^*-\log M_{200}$ relation imply a mass precision of 8%, on average.
In addition, the result on the intrinsic scatter of the $\log\lambda^*-\log
M_{200}$ relation, $\sigma_{\rm intr}=0.05\pm0.02$, confirms that $\lambda^*$
is an excellent mass proxy.

Abstract: Context. Galaxy clusters provide key insights into cosmic structure
formation, galaxy formation and are essential for cosmological studies. Aims.
We present a catalog of galaxy clusters detected in the Kilo-Degree Survey
(KiDS-DR4) optimized for cosmological analyses and investigations of cluster
properties. Each detection includes probabilistic membership assignments for
the KiDS-DR4 galaxies within the magnitude range 15<r'<24. Methods. Using the
Adaptive Matched Identifier of Clustered Objects (AMICO) algorithm, we
identified 23965 clusters over an effective area of about 839 deg2 in the
redshift range $0.1\le z \le0.9$, with a signal-to-noise ratio $S/N>3.5$. The
sample is highly homogeneous across the entire survey thanks to the restrictive
galaxy selection criteria we adopted. Spectroscopic data from the GAMA survey
were used to calibrate the clusters photometric redshift and assess their
uncertainties. We introduced algorithmic enhancements to AMICO to mitigate
border effects among neighbor tiles. Quality flags are also provided for each
cluster detection. The sample purity and completeness assessments have been
estimated using the SinFoniA data driven approach, thus avoiding strong
assumptions embedded in numerical simulations. We introduced a blinding scheme
of the selection function meant to support the cosmological analyses. Results.
Our cluster sample includes 321 cross-matches with the X-ray eRASS1 "primary"
sample and 235 matches with the ACT-DR5 cluster sample. We derived a mass-proxy
scaling relation based on intrinsic richness, $\lambda_*$, using masses from
the eRASS1 catalog. Conclusions. The KiDS-DR4 cluster catalog provides a
valuable data set for investigating galaxy cluster properties and contributes
to cosmological studies by offering a large, well-characterized cluster sample.

Motivation: 研究ACT DR6最新观测数据对暴胀模型的约束，特别是hilltop和hilltop-squared模型。

Method: 系统分析ACT DR6观测数据，比较与Planck观测结果的差异。

Result: 谱指数的变化显著缩小了模型参数范围，hilltop-squared模型受影响更明显。

Conclusion: ACT DR6数据对暴胀模型的约束更强，尤其是hilltop-squared模型。

Abstract: We analyze in a systematic way the implications for the classes of hilltop
and hilltop-squared inflation of the recent DR6 observations by the Atacama
Cosmology Telescope collaboration. We find that the reported shift in the
spectral index leads to parameter ranges for these models that are
significantly reduced when compared to the results obtained from the {\sc
Planck} observations. We mainly focus on the more dramatic implications for the
hilltop-squared class, but along the way we also highlight the milder impact on
the class of hilltop models.

*Wenjie Ju,Longlong Feng,Zhiqi Huang,Xin Sun,Weishan Zhu*

TL;DR: 提出了一种优化的多极算法，用于计算三点相关函数（3PCF），适用于大规模宇宙学数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为应对当前和未来宇宙学调查（如Euclid、DESI、LSST和CSST）中大规模数据集的高阶聚类分析需求。

Method: 基于多极展开框架，结合密度场重构和多分辨率分析，采用GPU加速的网格或粒子方案。

Result: 算法计算复杂度为$\mathcal{O}(L^2_{\text{trun}} N_g \log N_g)$和$\mathcal{O}(D^6_{\text{sup}} N_g)$（网格）或$\mathcal{O}(D^3_{\text{sup}} N_p)$（粒子）。

Conclusion: 该算法在开源工具$Hermes$中实现，为大规模宇宙学数据集提供了快速、可扩展的高阶聚类分析解决方案。

Abstract: We present an optimised multipole algorithm for computing the three-point
correlation function (3PCF), tailored for application to large-scale
cosmological datasets. The algorithm builds on a $in\, situ$ interpretation of
correlation functions, wherein spatial displacements are implemented via
translation window functions. In Fourier space, these translations correspond
to plane waves, whose decomposition into spherical harmonics naturally leads to
a multipole expansion framework for the 3PCF. To accelerate computation, we
incorporate density field reconstruction within the framework of
multiresolution analysis, enabling efficient summation using either grid-based
or particle-based schemes. In addition to the shared computational cost of
reconstructing the multipole-decomposed density fields - scaling as
$\mathcal{O}(L^2_{\text{trun}} N_g \log N_g)$ (where $N_g$ is the number of
grids and $L_{\text{trun}}$ is the truncation order of the multipole expansion)
- the final summation step achieves a complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(D^6_{\text{sup}} N_g)$ for the grid-based approach and
$\mathcal{O}(D^3_{\text{sup}} N_p)$ for the particle-based scheme (where
$D_{\text{sup}}$ is the support of the basis function and $N_p$ is the number
of particles). The proposed $in\, situ$ multipole algorithm is fully
GPU-accelerated and implemented in the open-source $Hermes$ toolkit for cosmic
statistics. This development enables fast, scalable higher-order clustering
analyses for large-volume datasets from current and upcoming cosmological
surveys such as Euclid, DESI, LSST, and CSST.

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 论文通过半经验方法研究了超大质量黑洞（BH）的演化，结合气体吸积和双星合并两种增长模式，利用贝叶斯框架约束参数，发现黑洞吸积参数与本地BH质量函数密切相关，并指出当前对BH人口统计的约束与引力波背景的解释可能存在矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究超大质量黑洞（BH）在宇宙时间尺度上的演化是现代天体物理学中的一个核心未解决问题，涉及许多不确定性。

Method: 采用半经验方法，结合连续性方程和Smoluchowski方程框架，描述BH的气体吸积和双星合并两种增长模式，并通过贝叶斯方法约束参数。

Result: 发现BH吸积参数与本地BH质量函数密切相关；双星BH合并率低于JWST观测的星系合并率；引力波背景的主要来源可能并非双星BH合并。

Conclusion: 当前对BH人口统计的约束与引力波背景的解释可能存在矛盾，需考虑其他天体物理或宇宙学来源来解释剩余信号。

Abstract: The evolution of the supermassive Black Hole (BH) population across cosmic
times remains a central unresolved issue in modern astrophysics, due to the
many noticeable uncertainties in the involved physical processes. Here we
tackle the problem via a semi-empirical approach with minimal assumptions and
data-driven inputs. This is firmly grounded on a continuity plus Smoluchowski
equation framework that allows to unitarily describe the two primary modes of
BH growth: gas accretion and binary mergers. Key quantities related to the
latter processes are incorporated through educated parameterizations, and then
constrained in a Bayesian setup from joint observational estimates of the local
BH mass function, of the large-scale BH clustering, and of the nano-Hz
stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background measured from Pulsar Timimg Array
(PTA) experiments. We find that the BH accretion-related parameters are
strongly dependent on the local BH mass function determination: higher
normalizations and flatter high-mass slopes in the latter imply lower radiative
efficiencies and mean Eddington ratios with a stronger redshift evolution.
Additionally, the binary BH merger rate is estimated to be a fraction $\lesssim
10^{-1}$ of the galaxy merger rate derived from galaxy pairs counts by JWST,
and constrained not to exceed the latter at $\gtrsim 2\sigma$. Relatedly, we
highlight hints of a possible tension between current constraints on BH
demographics and the interpretation of the nano-Hz GW background as
predominantly caused by binary BH mergers. Specifically, we bound the latter's
contribution to $\lesssim 30-50\%$ at $\sim 3\sigma$, suggesting that either
systematics in the datasets considered here have been underestimated so far, or
that additional astrophysical/cosmological sources are needed to explain the
residual part of the signal measured by PTA experiments.

TL;DR: 论文研究了拐点势能模型在永恒膨胀中的条件，发现当指数尾的指标λ₁≤3时，永恒膨胀必然发生，并指出这种模型难以避免永恒膨胀。永恒膨胀区域会形成婴儿宇宙，影响大尺度结构观测。

Motivation: 探讨拐点势能模型在产生原初黑洞时是否会导致永恒膨胀，并分析其对宇宙学观测的影响。

Method: 通过分析Fokker-Planck方程的最低特征值λ₁，推导永恒膨胀的充分条件，并结合模型参数验证文献中的例子。

Result: 发现当λ₁≤3时永恒膨胀必然发生，且拐点模型难以避免永恒膨胀。永恒膨胀区域形成婴儿宇宙，影响大尺度结构观测。

Conclusion: 拐点势能模型在永恒膨胀条件下与观测数据不兼容，需重新评估其适用性。

Abstract: Inflation with an inflection point potential is a popular model for producing
primordial black holes. The potential near the inflection point is
approximately flat, with a local maximum next to a local minimum, prone to
eternal inflation. We show that a sufficient condition for eternal inflation is
$\lambda_1 \leq 3$, where $\lambda_1$ is the index of the `exponential tail,'
the lowest eigenvalue of the Fokker--Planck equation over a bounded region. We
write $\lambda_1$ in terms of the model parameters for linear and quadratic
regions. Wide quadratic regions inflate eternally if the second slow-roll
parameter $\eta_V \geq -6$. We test example models from the literature and show
this condition is satisfied; we argue eternal inflation is difficult to avoid
in inflection point PBH models. Eternally inflating regions correspond to type
II perturbations and form baby universes, hidden behind black hole horizons.
These baby universes are inhomogeneous on large scales and dominate the
multiverse's total volume. We argue that, if volume weighting is used, eternal
inflation makes inflection point primordial black hole models incompatible with
large-scale structure observations.

Motivation: 探索物质创造作为暗能量和修正引力理论的替代方案，验证其是否能解释宇宙加速膨胀及热历史。

Method: 采用动态系统分析，考虑辐射、重子和暗物质三部分，暗物质通过绝热创造过程演化，引入创造压力。

Result: 两种模型均显示物质创造的显著证据，Model I与ΛCDM等价，Model II在DESI数据中表现更优。

Conclusion: 物质创造模型是ΛCDM的可行替代，尤其在DESI数据支持下，Model II更具潜力。

Abstract: We investigate the cosmological matter creation scenario, an alternative
approach to both dark energy and modified gravity theories, after the recent
DESI DR2-BAO release. We consider that the total matter sector consists of
three independently evolving components, namely, radiation, baryons, and dark
matter, with the latter being governed by an adiabatic matter creation process
that leads to a modified continuity equation. Due to the violation of the
standard conservation law, a creation pressure appears, and under a proper
choice of dark-matter particle creation rate one can obtain the present
accelerating phase as well as the past thermal history of the Universe. We
study two specific matter creation rates. By applying the dynamical-system
analysis we show that both Model I and Model II can mimic a $\Lambda$CDM-like
behavior. Furthermore, we perform a detailed observational confrontation using
a series of latest observational datasets including Cosmic Chronometers (CC),
Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa) (Pantheon+, DESY5 and Union3 samples) and DESI Baryon
Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) (DR1 and DR2 samples). In both Model I and Model II
we find evidence of matter creation at many standard deviations. Finally,
applying the AIC and BIC information criteria we find that Model I is
statistically equivalent with $\Lambda$CDM scenario, while Model II shows a
mixed picture, namely for most datasets $\Lambda$CDM scenario is favoured,
however when DESI data are included matter creation Model II is favoured over
$\Lambda$CDM paradigm.

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了GW231123事件可能源于早期物质主导时期形成的原初黑洞（PBHs），并通过计算PBH的质量函数、丰度、自旋分布和合并率密度，找到了与GW231123关键特性相符的参数组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GW231123事件的起源，验证其是否可能由原初黑洞（PBHs）形成，并探讨其与当前观测数据的一致性。

Method: 计算PBH的质量函数、丰度、自旋分布和合并率密度，寻找与GW231123事件特性匹配的参数组合。

Result: 发现PBH的丰度接近排除区域边界但仍自洽，且伴随的标量诱导引力波（SIGWs）在纳赫兹波段可忽略，与当前脉冲星计时阵列数据无冲突。

Conclusion: GW231123事件可能源于原初黑洞，其特性与当前观测数据一致，为PBH形成机制提供了支持。

Abstract: We investigate the possibility that the recently reported GW231123 event,
with component masses $M_1=137^{+22}_{-17}\,M_\odot$,
$M_2=103^{+20}_{-52}\,M_\odot$ and a local merger rate
$R_{\mathrm{local}}=0.08^{+0.19}_{-0.07}\,\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$,
originates from primordial black holes (PBHs) formed during an early
matter-dominated era. We compute the PBH mass function, abundance, spin
distribution and the merger rate density and find a set of choices for the
parameters to reproduce the key properties of GW231123. We also show that the
resulting PBH abundance, $f_{\mathrm{pbh}}= 1.64^{+5.00}_{-1.59}\times10^{-1}$,
is at the border of the exclusion regions, but still remains self-consistent.
Finally, we estimate the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) that are
inevitably generated during PBH formation. PBHs that interpret GW231123 are
accompanied by negligible SIGWs in the nano-hertz band, indicating no conflict
with current pulsar timing arrays data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前和未来实验（如CMB S4）覆盖的天区既不适合平面近似，也不适合全天空模拟，需要一种折中方法。

Method: 在3D盒中使用FFT模拟CMB图，然后采样到观测天区。

Result: 该方法比全天空模拟更高效，适用于中等大小天区。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展到高自旋（如偏振）模拟，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Simulated maps of the microwave background (CMB) radiation are generally
created using one of two methods: all-sky simulations use the spherical
harmonic transform, while maps covering small areas approximate the sky as
flat, allowing the use of fast Fourier transforms (FFTs). Current and
near-future experiments, particularly ones like CMB S4, will cover areas too
large for the flat-sky approximation but significantly less than the full sky.
In this regime, it can be more efficient to simulate maps in a 3-D box using
FFTs, and then sample onto the observed part of the celestial sphere. We
present a method for performing such simulations and show that it can be more
efficient than full-sky simulations. We develop the method for scalar maps, but
we expect it to be applicable to higher-spin (e.g., polarization) simulations
as well.

Conclusion: 统一的频域和傅里叶域形式为未来PTA分析提供了坚实基础，并强调了时间相关性在引力波信号解释中的重要性。

Abstract: We revisit the theoretical modeling and simulation of a Gaussian stochastic
gravitational wave background (SGWB) signal in a pulsar timing array (PTA). We
show that the correlation between Fourier components of pulsar timing residuals
can be expressed using transfer functions; that are indicative of
characteristic temporal correlations in a SGWB signal observed in a finite time
window. These transfer functions, when convolved with the SGWB power spectrum
and spatial correlation (Hellings \& Downs curve), describe the variances and
correlations of the pulsar timing residuals' Fourier coefficients. The
convolutions are the exact frequency- and Fourier-domain representations of the
time-domain covariance function. We derive explicit forms for the transfer
functions for unpolarized and circularly polarized SGWB signals. We validate
our results by comparing Gaussian theoretical expectation values with standard
simulations based on point sources and our own covariance-matrix-based
approach. The unified frequency- and Fourier-domain formalism provides a robust
foundation for future PTA precision analyses and highlights the importance of
temporal correlations in interpreting GW signals.

Abstract: The Euclid mission of the European Space Agency will deliver galaxy and
cosmic shear surveys, which will be used to constrain initial conditions and
statistics of primordial fluctuations. We present highlights for the Euclid
scientific capability to test initial conditions beyond LCDM with the main
probes, i.e. 3D galaxy clustering from the spectroscopic survey, the
tomographic approach to 3x2pt statistics from photometric galaxy survey, and
their combination. We provide Fisher forecasts from the combination of Euclid
spectroscopic and photometric surveys for spatial curvature, running of the
spectral index of the power spectrum of curvature perturbations, isocurvature
perturbations, and primordial features. For the parameters of these models we
also provide the combination of Euclid forecasts (pessimistic and optimistic)
with current and future measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
anisotropies., i.e. Planck, the Simons Observatory (SO), and CMB-S4. We provide
Fisher forecasts for how the power spectrum and bispectrum from the Euclid
spectroscopic survey will constrain the local, equilateral, and orthogonal
shapes of primordial non-Gaussianity. We also review how Bayesian field-level
inference of primordial non-Gaussianity can constrain local primordial
non-Gaussianity. We show how Euclid, with its unique combination of the main
probes, will provide the tightest constraints on low redshift to date. By
targeting a markedly different range in redshift and scale, Euclid's expected
uncertainties are complementary to those obtained by CMB primary anisotropy,
returning the tightest combined constraints on the physics of the early
Universe.

Abstract: The intracluster medium (ICM), composed of hot plasma, dominates the baryonic
content of galaxy clusters and is primarily observable in X-rays. Its
thermodynamic properties, pressure, temperature, entropy, and electron density,
offer crucial insight into the physical processes shaping clusters, from
accretion and mergers to radiative cooling and feedback. We investigate the
thermodynamic properties of galaxy clusters in the Simulating the LOcal Web
(SLOW) constrained simulations, which reproduce the observed large-scale
structure of the local Universe. We assess how well these simulations reproduce
observed ICM profiles and explore the connection between cluster formation
history and core classification. Three-dimensional thermodynamic profiles are
extracted and compared to deprojected X-ray and Sunyaev - Zel'dovich (SZ) data
for local clusters classified as solid cool-core (SCC), weakly cool-core (WCC),
and non-cool-core (NCC) systems. We also examine the mass assembly history of
the simulated counterparts to link their formation to present-day ICM
properties. The simulations reproduce global thermodynamic profiles for
clusters such as Perseus, Coma, A85, A119, A1644, A2029, A3158, and A3266.
Moreover, they show that CC clusters typically assemble their mass earlier,
while NCC systems grow through more extended, late-time merger-driven
histories. WCC clusters show intermediate behavior, suggesting an evolutionary
transition. Our results demonstrate that constrained simulations provide a
powerful tool for linking cluster formation history to present-day ICM
properties and point to possible refinements in subgrid physics as well as in
resolution that could improve the agreement in cluster core regions.

The model's prediction of peak luminosity is based directly on recent global simulations that follow the disruption self-consistently and contains no tunable parameters related to the emission physics. We construct the predicted joint distribution of peak luminosity and black hole mass, including both full and partial disruptions, and compare it to a sample of observed TDEs using Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. We find that the model reproduces the distribution in the ($M_{BH},L_{peak}$) plane for the bulk of the observed TDE population with good statistical consistency. The data strongly favor an old stellar population, with a sharp suppression of stars above $M_* \\simeq 1.5 - 2 M_\\odot$. They also indicate that, at fixed stellar mass, the volumetric TDE rate is nearly independent of black hole mass. Partial disruptions contribute a substantial fraction ($\\sim 30\\%$) of detected events in flux-limited samples and are essential for reproducing the observed distribution. The inferred population properties are robust to different approximations to the stellar mass-radius relation, although the event rate at high luminosity is sensitive to the form of this relation for massive stars. We predict a large population of difficult to detect low luminosity TDEs, implying that the true volumetric TDE rate may exceed that inferred from present samples by up to an order of magnitude."}

Very close encounters cause extreme tidal compression in the WD, raising temperatures enough to induce runaway fusion and produce a thermonuclear supernova (SN). Using the hydrodynamics code AREPO augmented with a 55-isotope nuclear reaction network, we performed high-resolution simulations of the TDE of a $0.6$ Msun C/O WD by a $500$ Msun IMBH for different values of the scaled impact parameter $b$ (i.e., the ratio of periapsis distance to tidal radius). Closer encounters produce combined TDE+SN events, with a partial burning of $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O into heavier isotopes -- the $^{56}$Ni fractions of the disrupted WD material vary from 1% at $b = 0.19$ to 82% at $b = 0.10$, while wider ones ($b \\gtrsim 0.20$) lead to standard TDEs. In all cases, the material away from the denser regions remains unburnt, spanning a wide range of radial velocities. Such WD TDEs also exhibit a central cavity, wherein little material is found below a radial velocity of several $1000 \\,\\mathrm{km s}^{-1}$. We also performed 1D and 2D radiative-transfer calculations for these WD-TDEs using the codes CMFGEN and LONGPOL, respectively, covering epochs from a few days to one hundred days. We recover the typical rise times and peak luminosities of SNe Ia, but with an extremely strong viewing-angle dependence of both light curves and spectra. At nebular times, isolated strong emission lines like [Ca ii] λλ 7291, 7323 may appear both displaced and skewed by many $1000 \\,\\mathrm{km s}^{-1}$ -- such extreme offsets are harder to identify at earlier times due to optical depth effects and line overlap.

To date, GREENBURST has detected a total of 50 pulsars and three FRBs. One of the pulsars, PSR J0039+5407, has a period of 2.2 s and was previously unknown. Using follow-up observations with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment, we found a timing solution for this pulsar which shows it to have a characteristic age of 2 Myr. Additional GBT observations show the pulsar has a very high nulling fraction ($\\sim70-80\\%$). All three of the FRBs are repeating sources that were previously known and were being monitored by the GBT as part of other projects. A major challenge for GREENBURST in the discovery of new FRBs is its single beam. This makes it hard to distinguish some of the pulses from sources of radio frequency interference. We highlight this problem with a case study of an FRB-like pulse that initially passed our interference filters. Upon closer inspection, the event appears to be part of a longer-duration narrow-band source of unknown origin.

Comments welcome!", "summary": "Observations of binary black hole (BBH) mergers provide a unique window into the lives of massive stars across cosmic time. Connecting redshift-dependent merger properties to massive star progenitors requires accurate models of cosmic star formation and chemical enrichment histories. Analytical fits for the metallicity-specific cosmic star formation rate density S(Z, z) are commonly used as proxies for the complex underlying star formation history, yet they remain unconstrained. Using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations, we evaluate the accuracy of these analytical S(Z, z) prescriptions and assess how simulation resolution and volume affect the inferred S(Z, z). By coupling the simulated and analytical S(Z, z) to the population synthesis code COMPAS, we investigate the resulting BBH merger rates and mass distributions. We find that analytical S(Z, z) prescriptions can overestimate BBH merger rates at high redshift ($z \\gtrsim 6$) by up to a factor of $10$-$10^4$, depending on cosmological simulation resolution, and can introduce spurious features in the BBH mass distribution. For example, they can produce an artificial feature near $8\\,M_\\odot$ in the primary mass distribution at $z \\lesssim 2$, which is absent when using the full simulation-based S(Z, z), while simultaneously suppressing high-mass features. These discrepancies arise because simple analytical models fail to capture a high-metallicity bump and a more flattened low-metallicity tail in the simulated S(Z, z) metallicity distribution. Our results highlight the importance of accurate star formation histories for modeling BBH populations, demonstrate the limitation of widely used analytical S(Z, z) fits, and underscore the need for careful integration of cosmological simulations, analytical fits, and population synthesis when interpreting gravitational-wave observations."}

Studying their progenitors, proto-clusters, sheds light on the earliest stages of cluster formation. Yet, detecting proto-clusters is demanding: their member galaxies are loosely bound and the emerging hot intracluster medium (ICM) may only be in the initial stages of virialization. Recent JWST observations located several proto-cluster candidates by identifying overdensities of $z\\gtrsim5$ galaxies. However, none of these candidates was detected by X-ray observations, which offer a powerful way to unveil the hot ICM. Here, we report the combined Chandra and JWST detection of a proto-cluster, JADES-ID1, at $z\\approx5.68$, merely one billion years after the Big Bang. We measure a bolometric X-ray luminosity of $L_{\\rm bol} = (1.5^{+0.5}_{-0.6}) \\times10^{44} \\ \\rm{erg \\ s^{-1}}$ and infer a total gravitating mass of $M_{500}= (1.8^{+0.6}_{-0.7}) \\times 10^{13} \\ \\rm{M_{\\odot}}$, making this system a progenitor of today's most massive galaxy clusters. The detection of extended, shock-heated gas indicates that substantial ICM heating can occur in massive halos as early as $z\\approx5.7$. In addition, given the limited survey volume, the discovery of such a massive cluster is statistically unlikely, implying that the formation of the large-scale structure must have occurred more rapidly in some regions of the early universe than standard cosmological models predict."}

This new component exhibits a strong spatial correlation with dense molecular clouds (MCs) identified in CO emission at Local Standard of Rest velocities of $0$-$5\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$. Spectrally, the cloud-associated emission implies an underlying cosmic-ray (CR) proton population described by a hard power law with an index of $Γ\\approx 2.1$, compatible with the standard diffusive shock acceleration prediction. We interpret the $γ$-ray emission in this region with a hadronic scenario involving two distinct CR populations: trapped CRs reaccelerated within the radiative SNR shell as proposed in previous work, and escaping CRs illuminating the nearby MCs. The derived CR proton intensity in the MC region significantly exceeds the local Galactic background measured by AMS-02, strongly suggesting that the cloud is illuminated by particles accelerated by S147.

Working in the Einstein frame, we consider a spatially flat FLRW universe filled with pressureless matter and a universally coupled dilaton. Expanding the conformal coupling function and the scalar potential around the least-coupling point, we obtain a closed and self-consistent autonomous system governing the late-time evolution of the scalar-matter sector. The resulting phase space contains a stable fixed point associated with least coupling, approached only asymptotically along cosmological trajectories. Therefore, at any finite epoch the solution typically retains a small displacement from the fixed point. In the DP regime this finite-epoch displacement sets the ambient coupling, and thus determines the magnitude of fifth-force effects and deviations from the equivalence principle in the nonrelativistic limit. By linearising the system around a finite-epoch reference state, we show that the damping of the displacement is controlled by the Jacobian eigenvalues of the DP fixed point. This yields a direct dynamical estimate of how rapidly deviations from the equivalence principle are reduced during cosmological evolution. The mechanism is global and cosmological in origin, and is conceptually distinct from local environmental screening as in chameleon or symmetron scenarios. Overall, our results illustrate how phase-space techniques provide a clear bridge between cosmological dynamics and weak-field departures from General Relativity."}

The expansion is performed around the high-density matter basis where $\\cos 2θ_m \\approx 1$, rather than the vacuum basis, reflecting the physical conditions in supernova cores. We obtain explicit expressions for the first few perturbation terms and derive the general structure of higher-order terms, which involve Mittag-Leffler functions that emerge from the fractional dynamics.

Recent theoretical and observational studies indicate a diversity of progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms. In the supernova remnant (SNR) phase, the diversity in Fe-K$α$ centroid energies and line luminosities suggests variations in the underlying explosion mechanisms. X-ray spectra of SNRs, which trace shocked ejecta and the surrounding medium, are crucial diagnostics of progenitor systems and explosion physics. Thanks to recent advances in spectroscopy with XRISM, high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy enables 3-D diagnostics, including line-of-sight velocities. In this study, we perform 3-D hydrodynamic simulations of SNRs from six Type Ia explosion models: two each of pure deflagration, delayed detonation, and double detonation. Each model is evolved for 1000 years in a uniform medium, consistently accounting for non-equilibrium ionization. Our efficient numerical scheme enables systematic parameter surveys in full 3-D. From these models, we synthesize X-ray spectra with $\\sim$1 eV resolution, exceeding XRISM/Resolve's spectral resolution. This work presents the first calculation of X-ray spectra for Type Ia SNRs derived from 3-D hydrodynamic simulations that follow the evolution self-consistently from the SN phase into the SNR phase. Our results show inter-model diversity in the X-ray spectra. Asymmetric, red- and blueshifted line profiles arise from the 3-D ejecta distributions. These findings demonstrate that 3-D SNR modeling can reproduce the observed diversity of Type Ia SNRs and provide qualitative constraints on progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms."}

We show that could be the case by modelling the inhomogeneities and their effects in three different ways: as clumped matter surrounded by voids, as back-reaction of small-scale structure on the overall expansion of the Universe, and, finally, as a large-scale curvature inhomogeneity. In all of these cases, the propagation of light is affected, and differs from that in a homogeneous and isotropic universe. The net result is that cosmological observables, such as angular diameter and luminosity distances, become distorted. We find, in all three models, that the inclusion of these effects pushes the distance-redshift relation towards closer agreement with recent data from both supernovae Ia from the Dark Energy Survey, and from baryon acoustic oscillations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. The amount of inhomogeneity in these models might not be enough to explain the entirety of the deviation from a cosmological constant, but is found to be of a similar order of magnitude, hinting that these data may be consistent with a universe dominated by a cosmological constant."}

While near-horizon magnetic field is usually assumed to originate from the accretion flow, additional large-scale magnetic fields - such as those supplied by a companion neutron star in stellar-mass binaries or by galactic fields around supermassive black holes - may also affect the horizon-threading flux. In this work, we study the superposition of a weak arbitrarily inclined external uniform magnetic field with the internal Blandford-Znajek split-monopole field around a Schwarzschild black hole. This setup generically gives rise to magnetic null points, where the total field vanishes. We compute the magnetic flux through an arbitrarily tilted hemisphere of the event horizon and show that the flux can be substantially suppressed by the external field. In the axisymmetric case, the flux can even vanish completely. However, with nonzero inclination, complete cancellation becomes impossible, despite significant reduction. We further explore the ionization and subsequent particle acceleration from a Keplerian accretion disk, finding that efficient collimated outflows persist even under significant field inclination. We show that the acceleration is critically dependent on the external field orientation, with the escape fraction maximized at non-zero inclinations due to the destabilization of trapping zones and minimized in the anti-aligned configuration, where closed magnetic loops effectively suppress the outflow.

Our analysis focuses on how accurately NF models recover the mean, standard deviation, and covariance of key statistics derived from convergence ($κ$) maps: The angular power spectrum $C_{\\ell}$, probability density function, and Minkowski functionals of weak lensing convergence $κ$-maps. We test two scenarios for training: (1) on the data vectors and (2) on the full $κ$-maps. In both cases, the NF models reproduce the mean and variance of the target statistics within percent-level accuracy. However, the accuracy of the off-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix is underestimated by up to $\\sim25\\%$. We study several mitigation strategies and find that data augmentation and training with noisy fields help improve covariance recovery to $\\mathcal{O}(10\\%)$. Our study demonstrates that while the means and variances of weak lensing statistics can be well modeled by NF, covariances can be significantly underestimated if mitigation strategies are not applied."}

(2020, 2024), appropriate for early times (t~1hour after merger). We explore jets with different powers and opening angles. We find that the presence of the jet shifts the spectral peak to longer wavelengths, with the strongest effect near the polar viewing angle. This occurs because the jet creates a thin, low-density outer layer ahead of the bulk ejecta. The opacity of this layer can be as high as kappa ~200 cm2/g, causing photons to escape from cooler, faster-moving outer layer rather than from the hot inner ejecta. The bolometric light curves likewise exhibit a clear imprint of the jet-ejecta interaction, showing suppressed early-time luminosity near polar viewing angles compared to the equatorial one, as the photosphere resides in this thin layer where radioactive heating is lower than in the bulk ejecta. These signatures are also evident in multi-color light curves, particularly in the ultraviolet and u-bands. In the Swift-UVW2 band at t~= 0.15 days for a source at 100 Mpc, the ultraviolet luminosities can reach ~ 19.5 mag if no jet is present, while the presence of the jet can make it fainter by ~ 2.5 mag. The strongest observational signature occurs in the UVEX-NUV, Swift-UVW2, and UVM2 bands, which remains detectable out to viewing angles of ~ 60 deg for t <=1 days. Rapid follow-up with future ultraviolet facilities, such as ULTRASAT and UVEX, will provide powerful probes of jet-ejecta interaction through early-time kilonova observations."}

CosmicFlows vs. Biteau's Galaxy Catalog with Cloning", "comment": "12 pages, 7 figures", "summary": "Knowledge of the actual density distribution of matter in the local universe is needed for a variety of purposes -- for instance, as a baseline model for ultrahigh energy cosmic ray sources in the continuum limit and for predicting the diffuse Dark Matter annihilation signal. Determining the local mass density and velocity distribution is the aim of the CosmicFlows project. An alternate approach is based on catalogs of galaxies, supplemented with some scheme for filling in for unseen galaxies. Here, we compare the density field proposed by Biteau (2021) with the quasi-linear density field of CosmicFlows2 (Hoffman et al. 2018) and the mean posterior field of CosmicFlows4 (Valade 2026). We find factor-two level differences in some regions and even greater in regions toward the Galactic center zone of avoidance (ZoA) (|l| < 30°, |b| < 20°) as filled by Biteau using \"cloning\". Within 11 Mpc the density field is well-determined by the Local Volume catalog (Karachentsev et al. 2018) which Biteau directly incorporates; at larger distances, Biteau (2021) should not be used in the ZoA where \"galaxies\" are entirely fictitious but otherwise is to be preferred over CosmicFlows emphasizing the direction and integrated mass of structures; the radial distribution of mass in Biteau (2021) is less robust due to line-of-sight peculiar velocities. The angular positions of structures in CosmicFlows are sometimes not congruent with evidence in the galaxy catalog."}

Astronomy across much of the electromagnetic spectrum has been fundamentally transformed with a rapid increase in ground-based and space-based capabilities to examine celestial objects on small scales that relate directly to their relevant physical processes. X-ray imaging capabilities, however, have fallen far behind observations at longer wavelengths. As such, without decisive advances in X-ray imaging, we will be unable to uncover key phenomena on the smallest astrophysical scales, leaving entire classes of high-energy discoveries beyond our reach. Here we describe several science goals for which high quality X-ray imaging is crucial and the status of some current technologies or mission concepts that would be required for these advances. In particular, we discuss the Accretion Explorer, a mission architecture under current study for a dispersed aperture X-ray interferometer."}

Galaxy power spectrum modelling in redshift space", "comment": "14 pages,9 figures", "summary": "Accurate modelling of redshift-space distortions (RSD) is essential for maximizing the cosmological information extracted from large galaxy redshift surveys. In preparation for the forthcoming analysis of the Euclid spectroscopic data, we investigate three approaches to modelling RSD effects on the power spectrum multipoles of mock H$α$ emission line galaxies. We focus on two one-loop perturbation theory models -- the effective field theory (EFT) and velocity difference generator (${\\rm VDG_ \\infty}$) -- which differ in their treatment of the real-to-redshift space mapping on small scales, and a third approach, the BACCO emulator, which adopts a hybrid strategy combining perturbation theory with high-resolution N-body simulations. We assess the ability of these models to recover key cosmological parameters, including the expansion rate $h$, the cold dark matter density parameter $ω_{\\rm c}$, and the scalar amplitude $A_{\\rm s}$, across four redshift bins spanning $0.9 \\leq z \\leq 1.8$. In each bin, we find that ${\\rm VDG_ \\infty}$ and BACCO outperform the EFT model across all scales up to $k_{max} \\lesssim 0.35 h\\,Mpc^{-1} $. While BACCO saturates in constraining power at intermediate scales and higher redshift, the ${\\rm VDG_ \\infty}$ model continues to improve parameter constraints beyond $k_{max} \\gtrsim 0.30 h\\,Mpc^{-1}$. The EFT model, although robust on large scales, exhibits significant parameter biases for $k_{max} \\gtrsim 0.25 h\\,Mpc^{-1}$, limiting its applicability to Euclid-like H$α$ samples. Among the full perturbation theory-based models, the enhanced treatment of small-scale RSD effects in ${\\rm VDG_ \\infty}$ improves cosmological parameter constraints by up to a factor of two."}

Conselice"], "title": "An X-ray-Emitting Proto-Cluster at $z\\approx5.7$ Reveals Rapid Structure Growth", "comment": "Accepted for publication in Nature", "summary": "Galaxy clusters are the most massive gravitationally bound structures in the universe and serve as tracers of the assembly of large-scale structure. Studying their progenitors, proto-clusters, sheds light on the earliest stages of cluster formation. Yet, detecting proto-clusters is demanding: their member galaxies are loosely bound and the emerging hot intracluster medium (ICM) may only be in the initial stages of virialization. Recent JWST observations located several proto-cluster candidates by identifying overdensities of $z\\gtrsim5$ galaxies. However, none of these candidates was detected by X-ray observations, which offer a powerful way to unveil the hot ICM. Here, we report the combined Chandra and JWST detection of a proto-cluster, JADES-ID1, at $z\\approx5.68$, merely one billion years after the Big Bang. We measure a bolometric X-ray luminosity of $L_{\\rm bol} = (1.5^{+0.5}_{-0.6}) \\times10^{44} \\ \\rm{erg \\ s^{-1}}$ and infer a total gravitating mass of $M_{500}= (1.8^{+0.6}_{-0.7}) \\times 10^{13} \\ \\rm{M_{\\odot}}$, making this system a progenitor of today's most massive galaxy clusters. The detection of extended, shock-heated gas indicates that substantial ICM heating can occur in massive halos as early as $z\\approx5.7$. In addition, given the limited survey volume, the discovery of such a massive cluster is statistically unlikely, implying that the formation of the large-scale structure must have occurred more rapidly in some regions of the early universe than standard cosmological models predict."}

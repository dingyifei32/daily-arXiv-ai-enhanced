Comments welcome!", "summary": "The transport of cosmic rays through turbulent astrophysical plasmas still\nconstitutes an open problem. Building on recent progress, we study the combined\neffect of magnetic mirroring and resonant curvature scattering on parallel and\nperpendicular transport. We conduct test particle simulations in snapshots of\nan anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics simulation, and record magnetic moment\nvariation and field line curvature around pitch angle reversals. We find for\nstrongly magnetized particles that (i) pitch angle reversals may occur either\nin coherent regions of the field with small variation of the magnetic moment\nvia magnetic mirroring, or in chaotic regions of the field with strong\nvariation of the magnetic moment via resonant curvature scattering; (ii)\nparallel transport can be modeled as a L\\'evy walk with a truncated power-law\ndistribution based on pitch angle reversal times; and (iii) perpendicular\ntransport is enhanced by resonant curvature scattering in synergy with chaotic\nfield line separation, and diminished by magnetic mirroring due to confinement\nin locally ordered field line bundles. While magnetic mirroring constitutes the\nbulk of reversal events, resonant curvature scattering additionally acts on\ntrajectories which fall in the loss cones of typical mirroring structures and\nthus provides the cut-off for the reversal time distribution. Our results,\nwhich highlight the role of the magnetic field line geometry in cosmic ray\ntransport processes, are consistent with energy-independent diffusion\ncoefficients. We conclude by considering how energy-dependent observations\ncould arise from an intermittently inhomogeneous interstellar medium."}

We investigated the spectral and temporal\nproperties of IGR J17511-3057, aiming to characterise its current status and\nhighlight possible long-term evolution of its properties. We analysed the\navailable NICER and NuSTAR observations performed during the latest outburst of\nthe source. We updated the ephemerides of the neutron star and compared them to\nprevious outbursts to investigate its long-term evolution. We also performed\nspectral analysis of the broadband energy spectrum in different outburst\nphases, and investigated the time-resolved spectrum of the type-I X-ray burst\nevent observed with NuSTAR. We detected X-ray pulsations at a frequency of\naround 245 Hz. The long-term evolution of the neutron star ephemerides suggests\na spin-down derivative of about -2.3e-15 Hz/s, compatible with a\nrotation-powered phase while in quiescence. Moreover, the evolution of the\norbital period and the time of the ascending node suggests a fast orbital\nshrinkage, which challenges the standard evolution scenario for this class of\npulsars involving angular momentum loss via gravitational wave emission. The\nspectral analysis revealed a dominant power-law-like Comptonisation component,\nalong with a thermal blackbody component, consistent with a hard state. Weak\nbroad emission residuals around 6.6 keV suggest the presence of a K-alpha\ntransition of neutral or He-like Fe originating from the inner region of the\naccretion disc. Self-consistent reflection models confirmed a moderate\nionisation of the disc truncated at around (82-370) km from the neutron star.\nFinally, the study of the type-I X-ray burst revealed no signature of\nphotospheric radius expansion.

In addition to our MeerKAT L-band data, we used GMRT observations\nfor four, and MeerKAT UHF observations for two of these pulsars to investigate\nthe frequency dependence of sub-pulse drift. We find subtle changes in the\ndrift as a function of frequency, but no clear overall pattern. Looking at the\ndistribution of bi-drifting pulsars over $P$, $\\dot{P}$ and $P_3$ suggests they\nare consistent with the underlying population of all drifting pulsars."}

In detached massive binaries, spherically symmetric\naccretion takes place. This accretion could result in effective energy release\nin the hard band only if the equipartition of the gravitational and magnetic\nenergy of plasma is established (Shvartsmans theorem). However, we show that\ndue to the magnetic exhaust effect this equilibrium is virtually never\nestablished for the actual magnetic fields observed on massive stars:\nShvartsmans theorem does not work. As a result, it is virtually impossible to\ndetect black holes in detached massive binaries by currently available means\n(mainly, through X-ray observations)."}

Noninteracting quarks", "comment": "9 pages", "summary": "It was shown that pair luminosity of the newborn strange star with\ntemperature of $10^{11}$ K may be as high as $L_\\pm\\simeq 10^{52}$ erg/s. The\nquestion remains: can a strange star maintain such a high surface temperature\nfor a long time? To answer this question we studied thermal evolution of\nnewborn strange star taking into account thermal conductivity of free quarks\nand neutrino emission by the URCA process. Our results show that extremely high\nluminosity due to the Schwinger process and insufficient thermal conductivity\nof quarks leads to development of steep temperature gradient at the surface of\nstrange star. As a result, the temperature at the surface and hence its\nluminosity decreases as a power law, reaching $10^{40}$ erg/s already at 10 ms.\nThis result holds even in the presence of neutrinosphere."}

Constraints on its strength $B$ can be derived from its influence on\ntime-delayed very-high-energy photons from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) in the\nelectromagnetic cascades along their path to the Earth. The present lower limit\nachieved on its intensity is $10^{-18}\\;\\mathrm{G}$. In this work, we simulate\ndata from the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), accounting for\nrealistic observational constraints, and we apply a joint spectral and temporal\nfit to characterize the IGMF. GRBs 190114C and 221009A are used as test cases\nto assess the sensitivity of CTAO. They demonstrate that a broad range of IGMF\nstrengths can be probed with a lower bound as high as $10^{-15}\\;\\mathrm{G}$.\nNotably, we show that observations by the CTAO first large telescope, LST-1,\nalready allow us to exclude field strengths up to $3\\times\n10^{-17}\\;\\mathrm{G}$."}

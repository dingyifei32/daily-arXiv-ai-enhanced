A cosmological interpretation of this signal\ncorresponds to absorption of 21 cm photons by neutral hydrogen at $z \\sim 17$.\nThe large depth of the signal has been shown to require an excess radio\nbackground above the CMB and/or non-standard cooling processes in the IGM.\nHere, we explore the plausibility of a scenario in which the EDGES signal is\nback-lit by an excess radio background sourced from a population of radio-loud\nAGN at high redshift. These AGN could also explain the unexpected abundance of\nUV-bright objects observed at $z > 10$ by JWST. We find that producing enough\nradio photons to explain the EDGES depth requires that nearly all high-$z$\nUV-bright objects down to $M_{\\mathrm{UV}} \\gtrsim -15$ are radio-loud AGN and\nthat the UV density of such objects declines by at most 1.5 orders of magnitude\nbetween $z = $10 and 20. In addition, the fraction of X-ray photons escaping\nthese objects must be $\\lesssim 1\\%$ of their expected intrinsic production\nrate to prevent the absorption signal being washed out by early IGM\npre-heating. Reproducing the sharp boundaries of the absorption trough and its\nflat bottom requires that the UV luminosity function, the fraction of UV light\nproduced by AGN, and the X-ray escape fraction have fine-tuned redshift\ndependence. We conclude that radio-loud AGN are an unlikely (although\nphysically possible) candidate to explain EDGES because of the extreme physical\nproperties required for them to do so."}

In this paper we examine in detail\nthe following three effects which can instead provide alternative explanations\nfor these observations: (1) a \"top heavy\" initial mass function (IMF) for the\nstars, (2) a variety of star formation histories (constant, exponentially\ndecreasing, and peaked star formation rates), and (3) a variety of initial\nmetallicities. Due to any of these three effects, galaxies of a given\nluminosity in JWST may be interpreted as having a larger stellar mass than they\nactually do. Our results are obtained using the Pegase stellar population code,\nand are presented as the ratio of the modified star formation efficiency\nrelative to the fiducial one (which uses a Salpeter IMF and constant star\nformation rate). As an example, if the high-mass end of the IMF goes as\n$M^{-1.35}$, the star formation efficiency and inferred stellar galactic mass\ncould be lower by a factor of $\\sim 10$ than in the fiducial case. Our\nexamination (keeping the star formation rate constant) of a top-heavy IMF with\nslope $\\alpha$ leads to a simple relation that is a good approximation to the\nnumerical results, $\\epsilon(\\alpha) \\approx \\epsilon_{\\rm fid}e^{2.66(\\alpha\n-2.35)}$.

To trace the temporal evolution of\nQPOs, we segment the dataset into shorter, continuous intervals, and compute\nand fit the averaged PDS for each interval. Our analysis shows that the overall\nbehaviour of the source is consistent with the literature; strong QPOs around 6\nHz are detected on the normal branch, while transitions to/from the flaring\nbranch -- occurring over timescales of a few hundreds of seconds -- are\ncharacterised by rapid, weaker quasi-periodic variability reaching frequencies\nup to 15 Hz.

In several instances, synchrotron seed photons do not\nfully explain the emission observed, suggesting the presence of other seed\nphoton sources to up-scatter. In this work, we consider the kilonova as a\nsource of seed photons for up-scattering in the afterglow. We model the\nkilonova as a thermal source injecting into the back of a GRB fireball, evolved\nusing a shell model, and with the electron and photon populations updated via a\nkinetic solver. We find that VHE emission from weaker afterglows, such as those\nfound in short GRBs, can be affected by such seed photons, with the kilonova\nseed photons mitigating the loss of synchrotron photons on the VHE emission\nwhen afterglow parameters are varied. We also find that VHE emission in\nstructured jets, due to weaker synchrotron emission at their wings, can also\nbenefit from this supply of seed photons, especially when viewed off-axis.

We created mock UHECR datasets that trace back\nwithin a 3 degree angular range from the galaxy M82 (a hypothesized UHECR\nsource), and we investigated the impact on such backtracking attempts of\nvarying GMF measurement sparsity and of varying GMF strength, which we emulated\nby rescaling the strength of the ordered components of the JF12 model.

This has motivated\nalternative approaches, including modifications to the underlying theory of\ngravity. In this work, we investigate the implications of a specific non-local\ngravity (NLG) theory, which modifies General Relativity by introducing\nnon-local effects that manifest as an effective dark matter component. We\nanalyze the velocity dispersion profiles of eight classical dwarf spheroidal\n(dSph) galaxies - Carina, Draco, Fornax, Leo I, Leo II, Sculptor, Sextans, and\nUrsa Minor - to test the predictions of NLG. Using the Jeans equation, we model\nthe kinematics of these galaxies and perform a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo analysis to constrain the parameters of the NLG kernel chosen for our\nanalysis. Our results indicate that NLG might successfully reproduce the\nobserved kinematics of dSph galaxies without requiring particle dark matter,\nproviding constraints on the scale-dependent modifications to gravity that are\ncompatible with previous studies in the literature. However, a parameter\ninconsistency remains in the cases of Fornax and Sextans galaxies that requires\nfurther attention."}

The number, strength, and\nduration of these pulses can lead to shell collisions that produce\nshock-powered transients, potentially explaining some of the most luminous\nevents, such as superluminous supernovae, and other rare transients. Rapid\nprogenitor rotation lowers the PPISN mass threshold and influences the\ndynamics, energetics, and chemical composition of PPISN-driven pulses. In this\nstudy, we computed 1D evolutionary models of massive, rotating PPISN progenitor\nstars with zero-age main-sequence masses of 85-140 solar masses and solar\nmetallicity and 10% solar metallicity. Our analysis reveals strong correlations\nbetween PPISN ejected mass and total energy as well as between ejected mass and\npeak ejected shell velocity. Additionally, moderate correlations indicate that\nhigher initial PPISN progenitor mass leads to greater mass ejection and energy\nrelease, while negative correlations show that rapid rotation appears to reduce\nmass ejection and kinetic energy of the shells. Subsequent pulses lead to\nhydrogen-poor, carbon- and oxygen-enriched ejected shells, indicating the\neffect of rotationally-induced chemical mixing in PPISN-driven episodic mass\nloss with implications for their transients. We model the light curve and\nsynthetic spectra that arise from the collision of two H-poor shells for one of\nour models using the radiation transport code SuperLite.

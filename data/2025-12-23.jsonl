Distributions and Spectra of PeV Cosmic Rays around Microquasars", "comment": "6 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "In the standard Galactic cosmic-ray (CR) paradigm, protons are accelerated up to ~1 PeV by Galactic sources. While supernova remnants (SNRs) have been traditionally considered as the primary accelerators, recent observations by LHAASO and HAWC have detected very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays exceeding 100 TeV from several microquasars, suggesting that these X-ray binaries can accelerate CRs beyond 1 PeV. We investigate the escape process of CRs from microquasars, focusing on the energy-dependent transport mechanisms. High-energy CRs are likely to have long mean free paths and move ballistically on scales smaller than their mean free path, while lower-energy CRs undergo diffusive propagation. This transition results in a spectral break in the CR distribution around the microquasar. We calculate CR energy spectra within a 10-30 pc radius for various diffusion coefficients and timescales. Our model predicts a spectral break and hardening at E_p ~10-100 TeV when the standard diffusion coefficient for the interstellar space is assumed. However, current VHE gamma-ray observations do not show clear spectral breaks, suggesting that the diffusion coefficient may be significantly reduced near microquasars, possibly due to magnetic field amplification by CR-driven turbulence."}

Recent observations of the gravitationally lensed LRD R2211-RX1 reveal century-scale photometric variability and a hysteresis loop in the luminosity-temperature plane, strongly suggesting that the optical emission originates from a pulsating, stellar-like photosphere rather than an accretion disk. This supports the \"quasi-star\" hypothesis, where a rapidly growing black hole seed is embedded within a massive, radiation-pressure supported envelope. In this work, we investigate the stability of these envelopes using the stellar evolution code MESA coupled with the non-adiabatic oscillation code GYRE. We identify a theoretical \"Quasi-Star Instability Strip\" with a blue edge at $T_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 5000-5200$ K. Models hotter than this threshold are stable, consistent with the non-variable LRD R2211-RX2 ($T_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 5000$ K), while cooler models are unstable to radial pulsations driven by the $κ$-mechanism in helium and hydrogen ionization zones. For quasi-star masses in the range $M_\\star \\sim 10^4-10^5 M_\\odot$, we find that the unstable fundamental radial modes ($\\ell =0$, n$_{\\rm p}=1$) have periods in the range $\\sim 20-180$ years. The first overtone ($\\ell =0$, n$_{\\rm p}=2$) is also unstable or marginally stable in some of our models, with typical pulsation timescales $\\sim 10-30$ years. These oscillations match the co-moving frame variability timescale of RX1. We argue that these violent pulsations likely drive enhanced mass loss analogous to super-AGB winds, which could affect the duration of the quasi-star phase and regulate the final mass of the seeded black hole."}

Using a force-free Beltrami configurations as representative equilibria of magnetically dominated outflows, we demonstrate that Lorentz mapping of stationary helical magnetic field produces quasi-periodic modulation of observable electromagnetic signatures, without invoking intrinsic plasma variability. This effect may be described as an aberration of force-free magnetic fields under Lorentz transformation. The characteristic frequency of the time variability is determined by the helical wave-number of the magnetic field, the viewing angle, and the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet outflow, and scales linearly with $Γ$. This establishes a purely kinematic relativistic origin of variability and introduces the concept of magnetic Lorentz seismology: the inference of magnetic field structure in relativistic outflows directly from observed temporal variability."}

To the extent that we are aware, this is the first formation-based theoretical prediction of LRD clustering from a model consistent with the LRD mass function. We find that this bias and clustering is insensitive to a wide range of the underlying uSIDM microphysics parameters, including the uSIDM cross-section $σ/m$ and uSIDM fraction $f$. This is therefore a robust prediction from the uSIDM model, and will allow for direct probes of the uSIDM paradigm as the origin of LRDs in the next few years.

In this Letter, we report observations of medium-scale anisotropies (MSA) at energies above 10 TeV using the LHAASO-KM2A array.

We also characterize the energy evolution of the fractional relative intensity across both excess and deficit regions.

Early alerts favored a neutron-star-containing merger, making this a compelling target. Motivated by theoretical predictions of coherent radio bursts from mergers involving a neutron star, we utilized the OVRO-LWA Time Machine system to analyze voltage data recorded around the time of the event. The Time Machine is a two-stage voltage buffer and processing pipeline that continuously buffers raw data from all antennas across the array's nearly full-hemisphere instantaneous field of view, enabling retrospective beamforming, dedispersion, and fast-transient candidate identification. For this event, we analyzed a 30-minute interval beginning 3.5 minutes after the merger, which included two minutes of pre-alert data recovered by the ring buffer. We searched the 50% localization probability region with millisecond time resolution in the 69-86 MHz frequency band. No radio counterpart was detected above a 7-sigma fluence detection threshold of ~150 Jy ms. Using Bayesian analysis, we place a 95% confidence upper limit on the source luminosity of L95 = 4 x 10^41 erg s^-1. These constraints start to probe the bright end of the coherent-emission parameter space predicted by jet-ISM shock processes, magnetar and blitzar-like mechanisms, and recent simulation-based scenarios for neutron-star-containing mergers. This study presents the first sensitive, large-area, millisecond-timescale search for prompt low-frequency radio emission from a GW merger with the OVRO-LWA, establishing a framework in which about ten additional events will yield stringent population-level constraints."}

Our treatment of systematic uncertainties includes a prescription for measuring and accounting for the weak lensing boost factor, consideration of a miscentering effect, as well as marginalization over uncertainties in the source galaxy photometric redshift distributions and shear calibration.

It is commonly accepted that, for low mass transfer rates, an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) is present in the inner region. But the observed relativistically broadened emission lines in the reflection spectra clearly indicate the existence of discs near the innermost stable circular orbit $(R_{\\rm{ISCO}})$. We investigate the interaction between the coronal flow and the disc in neutron star LMXBs, and find that gas condensation from the dominant, coronal accretion flow to an inner disc is enhanced as compared to that in black hole LMXBs as a consequence of irradiation of the corona by the neutron star surface. Computations show that for low mass transfer rates ($\\sim 0.005-0.02$ Eddington rate) a persistent weak disc can coexist with a coronal flow in the innermost region, where a pure ADAF would have been expected. The inner disc extends outwards from $R_{\\rm{ISCO}}$ to $\\sim 10 R_{\\rm{ISCO}}$ for Eddington ratios ($L/L_{\\rm{Edd}}$) as low as $\\sim 0.002$, covers a larger region for higher Eddington ratios, and eventually connects to the outer disc at $L/L_{\\rm{Edd}} \\sim 0.02$, thereby transiting to a soft state. We demonstrate that the observationally inferred region of the broad iron lines in the hard-state sources generally lies within the extension of the inner discs predicted by the condensation model. Disappearance of the broad iron lines is predicted at very low luminosities, either caused by very low accretion rates or disc truncation by strong magnetic fields."}

Using Planck CMB and DESI BAO data, we find that this framework is suitable for relaxing the Hubble tension.

When DESI BAO data are included in the analysis, the late-time expansion history becomes more tightly anchored, reducing the $H_0$ discrepancy to $\\sim 2.5σ$ level. This highlights the limited constraining power of currently available low-redshift data measurements, especially in the context of the $Ω_1Ω_2$-$Λ$CDM model, where dynamical dark energy dominates the background expansion over a relatively large redshift range. The model naturally exhibits a smooth quintessence--phantom transition followed by asymptotic de Sitter behavior of the dark energy equation of state, alters late-time cosmic dynamics, and preserves standard early-universe physics.

The study evaluates the ability of each model to reproduce the observed expansion history of the Universe through a joint statistical assessment based on the chi-squared statistics, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), and Bayes factor. While both models yield acceptable fits, $Λ$CDM consistently attains lower information-criterion values and higher likelihood, indicating a superior overall performance. An examination of the redshift evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ shows that $Λ$CDM naturally captures the transition from early-time deceleration to late-time acceleration, where as $R_h=ct$ predicts a strictly linear expansion. We also estimate the age of the Universe within both models, finding that $Λ$CDM prediction agrees with the Planck 2018 result, while the linear expansion in $R_h=ct$ leads to an older cosmic age. Recent JWST observations of unexpectedly mature high-redshift galaxies have reopened the discussion regarding whether the Universe may be older than implied by the standard model; although these results remain under active investigation, they underscore that fully resolving cosmic evolution may require refinements beyond the concordance paradigm."}

Using the Si layer of $13M_\\odot$ zero-metal progenitor as the initial composition, we calculate the nucleosynthesis by adopting the temperature, density, neutrino flux, and duration of nucleosynthesis as arbitrary parameters and compare the results with the observed abundances ratio of Sc, Ti, and V in very metal-poor (VMP) stars taken from the Stellar Abundances for Galactic Archaeology (SAGA) database. As a result, for the first time, we identify the quantitative requirements on local physical conditions. To reproduce the abundances ratios in the VMP stars, the explosive nucleosynthesis should take place under the neutrino exposure, which is time integration of neutrino flux, of $σ_ν\\sim 10^{35}\\,\\mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}}$ and temperature of $2.0\\,\\mathrm{GK}\\leq T \\leq 3.2\\,\\mathrm{GK}$. The dependence on the density and each value of the neutrino flux and the duration of nucleosynthesis is weak. We also discuss whether the quantitative requirements are realized during the explosion. Although the requirements are difficult to be realized in the one-dimensional simulations, the non-monotonic thermal evolution shown in recent three-dimensional simulations may satisfy them. Because the evolution is likely caused by turbulent motion stemming from the initial asphericity of the progenitor, it is important to calculate the long-term three-dimensional supernova explosion of multi-dimensional metal-free progenitor models and follow the nucleosynthesis self-consistently."}

This conclusion applies to all hierarchical levels of the baryonic universe, including galaxy clusters. We propose a simple statistical method for identifying possible radial motions of galaxies within clusters. To illustrate this method, we examined the structural features of the Virgo galaxy cluster and identified its substructure, comprising groups of galaxies of varying multiplicity. Galaxies in the substructure are somewhat brighter than those in the overall cluster, and each subgroup contains an active galaxy. Subgroups are considered to be the product of primordial ejections of matter from the central generator galaxy. It is shown that the average stellar magnitude of galaxies in subgroups positively correlates with their average velocity. This correlation can be interpreted as evidence of cluster expansion."}

This allows studying their morphological properties, required to understand their origin, at unprecedentedly high resolution (~2.3 kpc), crucial to disentangle the different cosmic ray components that populate the Original TRG. We produced a LOFAR-VLBI map at 1.5\" resolution using the wide-field technique with 56 hours of observations. This was the first time this technique was used for a galaxy cluster, especially for such deep observations. uGMRT and VLA data have been calibrated and imaged to produce spectral index maps and to apply further techniques to extract additional information, such as the radiative ages of the filaments or their equipartition magnetic field. Polarization information was also obtained using VLA through the rotation measure synthesis technique. Thanks to the LOFAR-VLBI wide-field image at 144 MHz, we revealed additional, very steep ($α> 2$) filaments beyond those attached to the radio galaxy, extending for around 250 kpc and previously known as the Trail. Combining LOFAR-VLBI with uGMRT and VLA, we found integrated spectral values between 1.1-1.7 for the filaments. Spectral analysis revealed also that the Original TRG has a complex structure, showing overlapping features with distinct spectral indices that extend throughout its tail. Polarized emission emerges only from the tail and the brightest part of the filaments, with values up to $22\\%$. Although there is no clear scenario regarding the formation of filaments, we highlight the importance of the Original TRG as the main driver of such structures, even at larger distances from the core."}

Our analysis spans quiescent, high, and pre-eruption dip states. We find that brightening amplitudes increase toward shorter wavelengths in both optical and UV bands, while the UV and X-ray fluxes are generally anti-correlated throughout all phases. During the 2023-2024 pre-eruption dip, soft and hard X-rays increased as optical and ultraviolet (UV) brightness declined, consistent with a transition from an optically thick to thin boundary layer driven by a reduction in the accretion rate. We also report, for the first time, a second, lower-amplitude dip occurring between September 2024 and February 2025 following the primary 2023-2024 pre-eruption dip.

Their relativistic jets, closely aligned to the line of sight from Earth, are a rich and complex environment, characterised by the presence of strong magnetic fields over parsec-scale lengths. Owing to their cosmological distance from Earth, these sources serve as ideal targets to probe non-standard gamma-ray propagation. In particular, axion-like particles (ALPs) could be detected through their coupling to photons, which enables ALP-photon conversions in external magnetic fields, leading to distinct signatures in the blazars' gamma-ray spectra. In this work, we explore a novel approach to constrain the ALP parameter space using gamma-ray observations, based on the use of machine-learning classifiers. We apply this technique to simulated observations of two bright blazars -- Mrk 501 and PKS 2155$-$304 -- with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), a next-generation gamma-ray facility well suited to probe such features, thanks to its improved energy resolution and point-source sensitivity with respect to present ground-based gamma-ray telescopes. The obtained $2σ$ exclusion regions on the ALP parameter space are consistent with those found by applying a standard likelihood-ratio test, and suggest that the CTAO sensitivity to ALPs could be extended beyond existing constraints over a wide mass range."}

Code available from https://github.com/EEmGuzman/resunet-cmb", "summary": "The search for primordial gravitational waves is a central goal of cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys. Isolating the characteristic $B$-mode polarization signal sourced by primordial gravitational waves is challenging for several reasons: the amplitude of the signal is inherently small; astrophysical foregrounds produce $B$-mode polarization contaminating the signal; and secondary $B$-mode polarization fluctuations are produced via the conversion of $E$ modes. Current and future low-noise, multi-frequency observations enable sufficient precision to address the first two of these challenges such that secondary $B$ modes will become the bottleneck for improved constraints on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves. The dominant source of secondary $B$-mode polarization is gravitational lensing by large scale structure. Various strategies have been developed to estimate the lensing deflection and to reverse its effects the CMB, thus reducing confusion from lensing $B$ modes in the search for primordial gravitational waves. However, a few complications remain. First, there may be additional sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization, for example from patchy reionization or from cosmic polarization rotation. Second, the statistics of delensed CMB maps can become complicated and non-Gaussian, especially when advanced lensing reconstruction techniques are applied. We previously demonstrated how a deep learning network, ResUNet-CMB, can provide nearly optimal simultaneous estimates of multiple sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization. In this paper, we show how deep learning can be applied to estimate and remove multiple sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization, and we further show how this technique can be used in a likelihood analysis to produce nearly optimal, unbiased estimates of the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves."}

We search for a combined signal of ALP-induced hard X-ray and soft $γ$-ray emission from 18 nearby pre-supernova stars using the full public 22-year INTEGRAL/SPI dataset, construct individual stellar spectra and link them in a coherent analysis. A maximum-likelihood approach is used to extract fluxes in the 20--2000 keV energy range. Stellar evolution models are employed to obtain the expected spectral shapes of ALP production processes peaking between 50--500 keV, depending on stellar mass and evolutionary stage. We construct a joint likelihood that incorporates uncertainties in stellar parameters to derive combined constraints on the coupling constants $g_{aγ}$ and $g_{ae}$ as a function of the ALP mass $m_a$. The hard X-ray and soft $γ$-ray fluxes of all selected stars are consistent with zero within uncertainties.

Starting from the general non-local-in-time expression for the galaxy overdensity, we explicitly compute the complete sixth-order basis of bias operators at leading order in spatial derivatives, finding 57 independent biases, compared to 46 in the corresponding local-in-time expansion. As previously found at fifth order, this difference implies that higher-order clustering statistics can distinguish between local- and non-local-in-time galaxy formation, and thus are sensitive, at a single redshift, to the formation time of galaxies.

We aim to assess the feasibility and efficiency of an optical-NIR follow-up strategy for CCSNe discovered via neutrino bursts, by modelling the spatial distribution of events and simulating realistic observational campaigns taking into account the size of the localization error box generated by triangulating the neutrino burst. We modelled the Galactic distribution of CCSNe, including the effects of interstellar extinction, and considered three main progenitor types: Wolf-Rayet stars, red and blue supergiants. We included the shock breakout in the EM signatures that could be detected following the neutrino burst. A population of CCSNe was generated and detected by different networks of neutrino observatories, including IceCube, KM3NeT, Super-Kamiokande, Hyper-Kamiokande, and JUNO. The resulting skymaps were used as input for GWEMOPT to produce optimized follow-up plans with two optical facilities: LSST and the TAROT robotic telescopes. Both LSST and TAROT exhibit comparable detection efficiencies for the simulated CCSN population. However, the TAROT network achieves similar success rates while requiring fewer pointings to cover the CCSN skymap. Our simulations demonstrate that neutrino follow-up campaigns can effectively CCSN optical counterparts using both large and small facilities. Depending on the neutrino network, the median number of pointings for the two tested optical facilities is of the order of 20 to 100 to find the EM emission.

The first model, Wess-Zumino dark radiation (WZDR), features a mass threshold in the dark sector that induces a step-like reduction in the dark radiation abundance as the dark temperature evolves. The second model, new atomic dark matter (nuADaM), introduces dark radiation that remains coupled to a subcomponent of dark matter until shortly before matter-radiation equality. Earlier analyses using Planck data demonstrated that these interactions significantly relax constraints on the dark radiation density and allow values of $H_0$ consistent with local distance-ladder determinations. Incorporating ACT DR6, which extends CMB measurements deep into the high-$\\ell$ damping tail, we find that constraints on the additional radiation component tighten substantially in both scenarios, closing most of the parameter space that previously enabled higher values of $H_0$. We further analyze a generalized model including both free-streaming and self-interacting dark radiation, and show that the resulting constraints are consistent with ACT's findings for the limiting cases of purely free-streaming or purely self-interacting radiation. Overall, ACT DR6 significantly restricts interacting dark radiation as a solution to the Hubble tension."}

Machine learning (ML) is an emerging tool that is useful in drawing valuable science out of incomprehensibly large datasets, identifying complex trends in data that are otherwise overlooked. Moreover, ML can potentially enhance the quality and quantity of scientific data as it is collected. This paper explores how a new ML method can improve the rate of classification of rare Ic-BL supernovae (SNe). New parameters called magnitude rates were introduced to train ML models to identify SNe Ic-BL in large datasets. The same methodology was applied to a population of SN Ia transients to see if the methodology could be reproducible with another SN class. Three magnitudes, three time differences, two magnitude rates and the second derivative of these rates were calculated using the first three available photometric data points in a single filter. Initial investigations show that the Random Forest algorithm provides a strong foundation for the early classifications SNe Ic-BL and SNe Ia. Testing this model again on an unseen dataset shows that the model can identify upward of 13% of the total true SN Ic-BL population, significantly improving upon current methods. By implementing a dedicated observation campaign using this model, the number of SN Ic-BL classified and the quality of early-time data collected each year will see considerable growth in the near future."}

The absence of TeV gamma-rays from NGC~1068 indicates neutrino production in compact gamma-ray-opaque region. The vicinity of the supermassive black hole, such as disk-corona, is an ideal region, where the high radiation density leads to efficient neutrino production as well as the gamma-ray attenuation. Disk-corona models predict that the neutrino emission from AGNs correlates with X-ray emission, which traces the coronal activity. In this paper, we assess whether the X-ray AGN population origin for TeV neutrinos can be tested by using the spatial correlation between the neutrino population and X-ray AGN population with future neutrino telescopes. By performing simulations, we find that, the AGN origin of the neutrino background above 100\\,TeV can be tested at a confidence level of $\\sim2.4σ$ with five-year observations of IceCube-Gen2, which has an angular resolution of $\\sim0.2$ degree. With better angular resolution and sensitivity in the energy range of above $300$\\,TeV, a 30-${\\rm km^3}$ underwater neutrino telescope, such as High-energy Underwater Neutrino Telescope (HUNT), is expected to reach a significance of $\\sim8.6σ$ in testing the association after five years of exposure."}

However, the standarly adopted definition of fine-tuning has a clear drawback: the more the primordial black hole abundance is small and cosmologically harmless, the larger the parameter space is fine-tuned. A reliable measure of fine-tuning should deliver a large value when the primordial black hole abundance is fine-tuned and at the same time reduce to something close to unity when it encounters typical sensitivity. Motivated by such arguments, we use the (modified version of) Wilson's naturalness criterion for quantifying the fine-tuning and naturalness and we show that the primordial black hole models are not technically unnatural."}

Mustafa"], "title": "Confining nonlinear electrodynamics black holes: from thermodynamic phases to high-frequency phenomena with accretion process", "comment": "27 pages, 14 figures", "summary": "We investigate a static, spherically symmetric black hole solution arising from Einstein gravity coupled to a confining nonlinear electrodynamics model that reproduces Maxwell theory in the strong-field regime while introducing confinement-like corrections at large distances. The resulting metric function is asymptotically Schwarzschild but carries a characteristic Q^3/(9ξ^2 r^4) correction, where $Q$ is the magnetic charge and $ξ$ is the nonlinear electrodynamics parameter, with the conventional Reissner-Nordström term Q^2/r^2 absent. We analyze the horizon structure and construct three-dimensional embedding diagrams to visualize spatial geometry. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we compute the weak-field deflection angle in vacuum, cold plasma, and axion-plasmon media, finding that the nonlinear electromagnetic corrections reduce the total bending compared to Schwarzschild at fixed Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass. The gravitational redshift, Joule-Thomson expansion coefficient, and heat capacity are derived, revealing phase transitions and inversion curves that depend on the model parameters. We obtain closed-form expressions for the photon sphere radius, Lyapunov exponent, and shadow size, demonstrating their sensitivity to Q and $ξ$ along observable Intensities. Fully relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion show that the confining geometry produces a $\\sim 40\\%$ enhancement in mass accretion rate relative to Schwarzschild and generates quasi-periodic oscillations with stable 3:2 and 2:1 frequency ratios matching observations from black hole X-ray binaries. These results establish the confining nonlinear electrodynamics black hole as a testable model that can reproduce high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation pairs without invoking black hole spin."}

Permitting explicit first-order phase transitions allows us to systematically search for twin-star solutions, i.e. the existence of stars degenerate in mass but differing in radius. We find that current observational constraints exclude all but two classes of twin stars. The first is characterized by a first-order transition occurring at a very low density, where the material properties of the system either stay largely intact or move away from the conformal limit. In the second, more interesting class, the discontinuity in the mass-radius curve emerges after a rapid crossover transition at a significantly higher density, with the speed of sound exhibiting two sharp peaks at distinct densities. Since neither class shows clear conformalization upon entering the second branch, the standard twin-star scenario linking the mass-radius discontinuity to deconfinement can be firmly ruled out, while even the remaining solutions -- disfavored by per-mille Bayes factors and in tension with theoretical bounds -- are likely to be excluded in the future."}

Relative to high-redshift Planck's CMB measurements, indicating a $\\sim 2σ$ evidence for a closed universe, low-redshift observations of BAO and SN Ia have the advantages of weak dependence on early universe physics, independently observational systematics, and strong redshift dependence of distances in constraining the cosmic curvature. Using the integrated observations from DESI BAO and SN Ia, we find an unexpected $2σ$ evidence for an open universe, regardless of the SN Ia sample employed. When considering DESI, SN Ia and the acoustic scale $θ_\\star$ data, the preference for an open universe exceeds the $3σ$ level, reaching $5σ$ for the case of DESY5 Supernovae data. Therefore, low-redshift observations favor an open universe, and this preference persists even when alternative high-redshift priors are adopted. Our results point to the existence of an additional tension between high- and low-redshift observations, present also in non-flat models beyond the minimal $Λ$CDM scheme, thereby challenging the standard inflationary predictions."}

The high-resolution RGS\ndata confirm the 'bare' nature of the source, showing no evidence for\nabsorption beyond the Galactic column, while the broadband spectrum\nunambiguously reveals the presence of relativistic reflection from the\ninnermost accretion disc (in the form of a relativistically broadened iron\nemission and associated Compton reflection hump) as well as confirming the\npresence of the strong soft excess reported previously. We explore whether\nrelativistic reflection can successfully account for the soft excess along with\nthe higher-energy reflection features, utilizing the two most-commonly used\nreflection codes (REFLIONX, XILLVER). Ultimately we find that both models are\nable to successfully reproduce the soft excess, though in the case of the\nXILLVER model this is contingent on reducing the strength of the O VIII line\nincluded in the model, as otherwise this feature prevents the model from\nreproducing the data. The reflection models that successfully reproduce the\nbroadband data imply a relatively high density for the accretion disc of $\\log\n[n_{\\rm{e}} / \\rm{cm}^{-3}] \\sim 18$, consistent with the loose\nanti-correlation seen from other AGN in the $\\log [n_{\\rm{e}} / \\rm{cm}^{-3}]$\nvs $\\log[m_{\\rm{BH}} \\dot{m}^2]$ plane, as well as a moderate-to-high black\nhole spin of $a^* \\gtrsim 0.7$.

In this\nLetter, we argue that radio emission is generated in a closed, twisted magnetic\nflux bundle originating near the magnetic pole and extending beyond 100 km from\nthe magnetar. The electron-positron flow in the twisted bundle has to carry\nelectric current and, at the same time, experiences a strong drag by the\nradiation field of the magnetar. This combination forces the plasma into a\n``radiatively locked'' state with a sustained two-stream instability,\ngenerating radio emission. We demonstrate this mechanism using novel\nfirst-principles simulations that follow the plasma behavior by solving the\nrelativistic Vlasov equation with the discontinuous Galerkin method. First,\nusing one-dimensional simulations, we demonstrate how radiative drag induces\nthe two-stream instability, sustaining turbulent electric fields. When extended\nto two dimensions, the system produces electromagnetic waves, including\nsuperluminal modes capable of escaping the magnetosphere. We measure their\nfrequency and emitted power, and incorporate the local simulation results into\na global magnetospheric model. The model explains key features of observed\nradio emission from magnetars: its appearance after an X-ray outburst, wide\npulse profiles, luminosities $\\sim 10^{30}{\\rm{erg/s}}$, and a broad range of\nfrequencies extending up to $\\sim 100\\, \\mathrm{GHz}$."}

Code to reproduce results available at\n  https://github.com/pdp79/act_dr6_analysis", "summary": "The polarized light of the cosmic microwave background is sensitive to new\nphysics that violates parity symmetry. For example, the interaction of photons\nwith the fields of elusive dark matter and dark energy could cause a uniform\nrotation of the plane of linear polarization across the sky, an effect known as\ncosmic birefringence. We extract the cosmological rotation angle, $\\beta$,\nusing Bayesian analysis of parity-violating correlations, $EB$ and $TB$, of\npolarization data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6. We\nuse prior probabilities for instrumental miscalibration angles derived from the\noptics model for the ACT telescope and instruments, and marginalize over a\nresidual intensity-to-polarization leakage. We measure $\\beta = 0.215^\\circ\\pm\n0.074^\\circ$ (68\\% confidence level), which excludes $\\beta=0$ with a\nstatistical significance of $2.9\\sigma$. Although there remain systematics in\nthe ACT data that are not understood and do not allow us to draw strong\ncosmological conclusions, this result is consistent with previous independent\nresults from the \\wmap\\ and \\planck\\ missions. It is suggestive that\nindependent data sets and analyses using different methodologies have yielded\nthe same sign and comparable magnitudes for $\\beta$."}

Submitted to JCAP", "summary": "Predicting the statistical properties of the neutral hydrogen (HI) density\nfield during reionization is an important step in using upcoming 21 cm\nobservations to constrain models of reionization. Semi-numerical models of\nreionization are often coupled with the collapse fraction field\n$f_{\\text{coll}}(\\mathbf{x})$, which determines the fraction of dark matter\nwithin halos. In this work, we improve upon earlier prescriptions that compute\n$f_{\\text{coll}}$ based on the dark matter overdensity $\\delta(\\mathbf{x})$\nalone, to include more information about the environment in the form of\neigenvalues of the tidal tensor. We compute the mean of the $f_{\\text{coll}}$\nconditioned on these eigenvalues from a set of high-resolution, small-volume\nsimulations and use them to sample the $f_{\\text{coll}}$ field of a\nlow-resolution, large-volume simulation. We subsequently use a semi-numerical\ncode for reionization to compute the HI density field and its power spectrum,\nand benchmark our results against a reference high-resolution, large-volume\nsimulation. Across variations in redshift, ionized fraction, grid resolution,\nand minimum halo mass, our method recovers the large-scale HI power spectrum\nwith errors at the $\\lesssim 2\\%-5\\%$ level for $k \\lesssim 0.5~ h~\n\\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, providing a substantial improvement over the $\\sim 10\\%$\nresults previously obtained using density-only conditioning. Overall, this\nmakes our method a simple yet efficient tool for forward modeling HI maps\nduring reionization."}

The curvature terms are usually neglected, but they can be\nlarge at the location of matter particles and impact the angular diameter\ndistance. We apply the recently introduced post-geometrical optics\napproximation that includes curvature to gravitational wave propagation.\nAssuming that particles are localised within their Compton wavelength, the\ncurvature due to electrons leads to a large effect on the angular diameter\ndistance, but caustic formation invalidates the post-geometrical optics\napproximation. We conclude that the interesting regime of validity of the\napproximation is limited, as it ceases to apply when the curvature effects\nbecome large.

However, it\nis common practice to simulate coeval brightness temperature boxes, and then\napply post-processing algorithms that treat the lightcone effect and\nredshift-space distortions separately, assuming they can be added in sequence.\nWe instead model them together, allowing for partial coeval cell contributions,\nand ensuring that velocity-induced frequency shifts are computed at the correct\ncosmic time for every position along the line of sight. We show that\nconsidering these effects simultaneously creates a difference in the shape of\nthe power spectrum over all Fourier scales, and remains recoverable after\nsemi-blind foreground removal. We show that our lightcones consist of an\naverage of 8% and maximum of 120% of a coeval cell length. These contributions\nto a 21cm brightness temperature lightcone voxel are shifted from within a +/-\n0.5 MHz range of the emitted frequency. The boost in the power spectrum seen\nover small scales (k>1.5 Mpc) of our robust 21 cm lightcone method compared to\nbasic methods is recoverable after the addition and removal of diffuse radio\nforegrounds. The largest differences during the Epoch of Reionisation lie in\nthe k-space, where the noise sensitivity for a 1000-hour SKAO-low observation\nis greater than the signal. However, in the cosmic dawn, we have shown that the\nmajor differences lie outside of this noise-dominated region."}

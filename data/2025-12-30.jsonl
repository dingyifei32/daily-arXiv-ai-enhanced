Stacking analyses coadd cutouts of LIM data on positions of known signal emitters, robustly detecting signal otherwise hidden in a noisy map. In this article, we present two augmentations of a stacking pipeline, both aiming to refine the sensitivity of the stack by assuming a specific observed signal shape in 2D spatial axes or 3D spatial and spectral axes, as well as stacking on source coordinates more precise than the resolution of the LIM data cube. We test these methods on a series of simplistic and complex simulations mimicking observations with the CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder. We find that these fitting methods provide up to a 25% advantage in detection significance over the original stack method in realistic COMAP-like simulations. We also find that the optimal fitting profile, given our CO line model and galaxy model, is larger than the 5' width of the COMAP beam and takes on a Lorentzian shape in the spectral dimension. Our findings suggest a nuanced dependence of the optimal profile size and shape on the LIM signal itself, including redshift-space clustering and fingers-of-God effects that depend on the tracer luminosity function and bias."}

However, the signal is extremely faint and contaminated by gravitational lensing, instrumental noise, and astrophysical foregrounds. Here we present a score-based diffusion approach, formulated using variance-exploding stochastic differential equations (VE-SDEs), to reconstruct the primordial B-mode angular power spectrum from contaminated observations. The method employs a reverse SDE guided by a score model trained exclusively on random realizations of the primordial low $\\ell$ B-mode angular power spectrum corresponding to a fixed tensor-to-scalar ratio $r=0.001$. During inference, the reverse SDE iteratively drives the observed angular power spectrum toward the learned primordial manifold, effectively denoising and delensing the input. The model is tested on simulated observational spectra that include gravitational lensing, complex polarized foreground combinations, and instrumental noise characteristics representative of the proposed ECHO mission. The trained score model learns the underlying statistical distribution of the primordial B-mode field for the given $r$, which acts as a physics-guided prior that can generate new, consistent realizations of the signal. This approach provides a robust framework for primordial signal recovery in future CMB polarization missions."}

To achieve our objective, we analyze the behavior of the primordial curvature power spectrum, which exhibits a large enhancement at small scales corresponding to large wavenumbers $k$.

Indeed, the neutrino flux predicted by the hadronic model for RS Oph was below IceCube sensitivity. T Coronae Borealis (T CrB), a nova similar to RS Oph, is anticipated to undergo an outburst soon. Being closer to Earth (0.8 kpc versus 2.45 kpc for RS Oph), T CrB is expected to yield a higher neutrino flux, making the upcoming outburst a once in a lifetime opportunity to test-and potentially detect-nova neutrinos. In this work, we present the first model-based estimates of the hadronic secondary fluxes from T CrB and assess their detectability with gamma-ray (LHAASO, Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, H.E.S.S., MACE, and HERD) and neutrino (IceCube and KM3NeT) telescopes. We adopt two proton-acceleration mechanisms: (i) an external shock (ES) driven mechanism at the interaction ($10^{13}$ cm) of nova ejecta and the red giant wind, and (ii) magnetic reconnection (MR) near the white dwarf surface ($10^{9}$ cm). The latter, arising deep inside the nova system, will fully absorb gamma-rays while allowing only neutrinos to escape. This could potentially produce neutrino signals hours before the ES origin photons or neutrinos-a unique temporal delay signature. For our benchmark ES model, gamma-rays are detectable across all facilities, while the neutrino detection prospect is poor. Only a tiny upper part of the ES model parameter space is above IceCube/KM3NeT sensitivity. In contrast, both observatories have significantly better prospects for detecting neutrinos in the MR scenario."}

To overcome the single channel dominance degeneracy in high dimensional parameter scans, two classes of structural priors are introduced into the objective function: a \\texttt{mixing} prior to suppress extreme channel fractions and an \\texttt{entropy} prior to favor multi channel coexistence. Furthermore, the adoption of a layered warmness criterion (e.g., $Q \\equiv Υ/3H$) decouples model selection from cosmological observables, thereby enhancing analytical transparency.

By tracking the complex electric field vector for each photon during its atmospheric transport and propagation in general relativistic and birefringent magnetospheres, our Monte Carlo simulation, named MAGTHOMSCATT, allows for capturing the complete polarization properties, including the intricate interplay between linearity and circularity. The new inclusion in MAGTHOMSCATT of quantum electrodynamical influences on polarization in the magnetosphere is presented. We simulate the pulsed and polarized X-ray emission from the outer layers of optically thick, fully ionized atmospheres of neutron stars, with a focus on the radiation emitted from extended polar caps of magnetars, which are the most highly magnetized neutron stars. Using the recent intensity pulse profile data for the magnetar 1RXS J11708-4009, we constrain the geometric parameters, namely the angles between the magnetic axis and the observer's viewing direction relative to the spin axis, as well as the sizes of emission regions. The distributions of these parameters and the best-fit configuration are provided. In addition, we discuss the important impacts of vacuum birefringence in the magnetosphere on increasing the linear polarization degree. A comparison with the case of a weakly magnetized neutron star, RX J0822.0-4300, is also discussed. Our simulation still needs further development, particularly to incorporate the vacuum resonance effect.

Our results show that the observed $>$TeV gamma rays can originate from either $pγ$ or $pp$ interactions, depending on the location and physical conditions of the emission region, while also reproducing the lower-energy spectra. The different configurations yield unique, observationally testable predictions. In the $0.1-10$~TeV energy range, where current observations provide only upper limits, they predict either a deep dip, a mild suppression, or a power-law spectrum. Additionally, models involving AU-scale blob regions predict strong variability, while those invoking more extended and static external zones show more stable behavior. We also provide a possible qualitative explanation for the distinct modulation patterns across different energy bands, which relies primarily on changes in the Doppler factor and external $γγ$ absorption.

Radio emission has recently been detected in TDEs and is commonly attributed to synchrotron radiation from both wind and jetted outflows. However, several TDEs exhibit bright radio flares at late times, which cannot be easily explained if the wind is launched promptly after the stellar disruption. In this study, we model the radio light curves of TDEs with delayed radio flares using three scenarios: an instantaneous wind, a delayed wind, and a delayed relativistic jet. We show that the instantaneous wind model struggles to reproduce delayed radio flare events, indicating the necessity of an additional delayed outflow component. In contrast, the delayed wind model provides a consistent explanation for the observed radio phenomenology, successfully reproducing events both with and without delayed radio flares. For some delayed radio flare events (e.g., ASASSN-15oi and AT 2019dsg), both the delayed wind and delayed jet models can reproduce the observed radio light curves. The delayed jet model produces x-ray and optical emission that is detectable at typical TDE distances, in contrast to wind-driven scenarios. This highlights how multiwavelength observations offer an effective means of distinguishing among possible outflow mechanisms."}

Accurately constraining the internal DM content of DANSs is therefore of critical importance. In this work, we construct the equations of state (EoS) for DANS matter by employing twelve nuclear matter (NM) models within the covariant density functional (CDF) theory and a self-interacting fermionic model for DM. Using these EoSs as input, we solve the two-fluid Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equations to systematically investigate the influence of DM on the global properties of neutron stars (NSs). By incorporating recent observational constraints on NS properties, the maximum DM mass fraction $f_χ^{\\mathrm{max}}$ in DANSs is determined for each NM EoS model. Our analysis reveals a strong linear correlation (Pearson coefficient $r=0.98$) between $f_χ^{\\mathrm{max}}$ and the maximum mass of a pure NS, $M_{\\rm{NS}}^{\\mathrm{max}}$, described by $f_χ^{\\mathrm{max}} = 0.22 M_{\\mathrm{NS}}^{\\mathrm{max}} - 0.44$. Leveraging this correlation and the observed NS maximum mass distribution, $P(M_{\\text{NS}}^{\\max} \\mid \\text{EM})$, we derive the probability distribution function (PDF) for the maximum DM mass, $P(M_χ^{\\max} \\mid \\text{EM})$, in DANSs. We find that at the 68\\% confidence level, $M_χ^{\\mathrm{max}}=0.150^{+0.070}_{-0.051}\\ M_{\\odot}$. This quantitative constraint on the DM mass provides a critical prior for interpreting potential observational signatures of DANSs, such as anomalous tidal deformabilities and distinctive gravitational-wave signals."}

These events are characterized by a sufficiently long quiescent period during which the on-board trigger system can reset, resulting in the subsequent emission being recorded as a second independent event. Consistent sky localization confirms that both trigger events originated from the same astrophysical source. Here, we present a systematic classification and characteristics study of three such cases: GRB 091024A, GRB 110709B, and GRB 220627A. We investigate each trigger episode emission independently using standard classification diagnostics, including duration ($T_{90}$), hardness ratio, minimum variability timescale (MVT), spectral lag ($τ_{\\rm lag}$), peak energy ($E_{\\rm p}$), and energetics. We compare these properties with those of typical long GRBs (LGRBs) and with single-trigger LGRBs that exhibit extended quiescent periods. Our analysis reveals that all sub-bursts from the three double-trigger events consistently lie within the LGRB classification region. These results indicate that double-trigger GRBs are not a physically distinct subclass, but rather products of LGRB central engines that undergo extended dormancy and subsequent reactivation."}

A genetic algorithm is employed for the global numerical solution and statistical inference of the background field dynamics. To overcome the single channel dominance degeneracy in high dimensional parameter scans, two classes of structural priors are introduced into the objective function: a \\texttt{mixing} prior to suppress extreme channel fractions and an \\texttt{entropy} prior to favor multi channel coexistence. Furthermore, the adoption of a layered warmness criterion (e.g., $Q \\equiv Υ/3H$) decouples model selection from cosmological observables, thereby enhancing analytical transparency. The complete workflow is demonstrated on a $14$ dimensional phenomenological model. An ablation study of the priors (\\texttt{noprior} vs. \\texttt{mixing} vs. \\texttt{mixing+entropy}) yields $18871$ viable parameter points, revealing that the priors significantly enhance the discovery probability of non-trivial multi channel solutions within a parameter space naturally biased towards single channel dominance. After imposing the observational constraint $r < 0.036$, the number of retained solutions for each scenario is $14485$, $1889$, and $1971$, respectively. A typical best fit solution exhibits a \"channel relay\" dynamical feature during its evolution and a genuinely mixed state at the pivot scale (e.g., $f_{{\\rm HT},*}\\simeq 0.399480$, $f_{{\\rm th},*}\\simeq 0.600517$), implying that the microscopic origin of dissipation need not be unique within a single inflationary history."}

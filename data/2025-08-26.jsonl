Such flows\nfeature quasi-periodic magnetic flux eruptions, power jet-like magnetic tower\noutflows, and consequently alter the predominant contribution to angular\nmomentum transfer inside the circumbinary disk. In this work, we provide a\ncomprehensive analysis of the properties of these flows around equal-mass\nbinary systems on circular orbits ultilizing massively parallel\nthree-dimensional Newtonian magnetohydrodynamics simulations. We investigate\nthe impact of the equation of state and of dynamical cooling, as well as that\nof the (large-scale) magnetic field topology.

To address these issues, we propose a general\ndisformal coupling between dark energy (DE) and dark matter from a\nfield-theoretic action which can generate a rich variety of interactions\nincluding conformal and pure-momentum coupling scenarios. Our analysis reveals\nthat a pure disformal coupling naturally produces a unique interacting Early\nDark Sector, wherein the interactions with dark matter suppress the Hubble\nfriction on the DE scalar field leading to a kinetic-driven cosmological\nconstant-like behavior at early times followed by its dilution as $a^{-6}$ and\neventually leading to a potential-driven epoch characteristic of late-time dark\nenergy. In contrast to existing Early Dark Energy (EDE) models that rely on\nfinely-tuned potentials, the EDE-like behavior, in our framework, is purely a\nconsequence of the disformal coupling paired with the dilution of dark matter,\noffering a more fundamental and less ad hoc solution to cosmological tensions.\nThis framework also predicts a suppression of power in the CMB temperature\nspectrum on large angular scales, offering a potential physical explanation for\nthe observed low-$\\ell$ anomaly.

A key feature of our formulation is the explicit decomposition\nof the density field into two physically distinct components: the\n\\emph{Jacobian deviation}, which encodes intrinsic linear and nonlinear growth,\nand the \\emph{displacement-mapping effect}, which captures large-scale\nconvective distortions. This separation enables a fully analytic and infrared\n(IR)-safe resummation, ensuring exact IR cancellation, a consistent Gaussian\ndescription of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) damping, and the correct\nresidual structure in cross spectra between fields with distinct IR behavior.\nThe perturbative expansion of ULPT naturally generates Galileon-type operators,\nthereby providing a compact and physically motivated operator basis for\nnonlinear and nonlocal Lagrangian bias, and allowing for a renormalization-free\ntreatment of biased tracers.

Considering broad emission line blazars, i.e., flat spectrum\nradio quasars (FSRQs), the dense photon fields surrounding the relativistic jet\ncan prohibit the particle population from accelerating to very high energies\nand producing VHE radiation. They can also possibly make the environment opaque\nfor the VHE $\\gamma$ rays due to $\\gamma\\gamma$ pair production, thus\nexplaining the paucity of VHE-detected FSRQs and non-detection of TeV radiation\n($>$1 TeV) from them. Here we report, for the first time, a $>$7$\\sigma$\ndetection of an FSRQ, S5 1027+74 ($z=0.123$), in the VHE band, including the\nfirst ever detection of TeV emission from an object of this class, using the\nFermi Large Area Telescope observations. Its $\\gamma$-ray spectrum covering the\n100 MeV to 2 TeV band revealed a prominent spectral break with a flat, rising\nshape above $\\sim$10 GeV, a feature never detected from other VHE-detected\nFSRQs. The radio-to-$\\gamma$-ray spectral energy distribution of S5 1027+74\nprovides strong evidence of a third bump peaking at multi-TeV energies. These\nenigmatic findings imply that FSRQ jets can accelerate particles to extremely\nhigh energies and provide tantalizing clues about the complex radiative\nenvironment of relativistic jets."}

In\nelectron-ion shocks, electrons can be heated up to large Lorentz factors,\nmaking them an attractive scenario to explain the high minimum electron Lorentz\nfactors regularly needed to describe the emission of BL Lac objects. Still, the\nthermal electron component is commonly neglected when modelling the\nobservations, although it holds key informations on the shock properties. We\nmodel the broadband emission of the HSP blazar Mrk421 employing particle\ndistributions that include a thermal relativistic Maxwellian component at low\nenergies followed by a nonthermal power-law, as motivated by PIC simulations.\nThe observations in the optical/UV and MeV-GeV bands efficiently restrict the\nnonthermal emission from the Maxwellian electrons, which we use to derive\nconstraints on the basic properties, such as the fraction $\\epsilon_e$ of the\ntotal shock energy stored in the nonthermal electrons. The best-fit model\nyields a nonthermal electron power-law with an index of ~2.4, close to\npredictions from shock acceleration. Successful fits are obtained when the\nratio between the Lorentz factor at which the nonthermal distribution begins\n($\\gamma_{\\rm nth}$) and the dimensionless electron temperature ($\\theta$)\nsatisfies $\\gamma_{\\rm nth}/\\theta \\lesssim 8$. Since $\\gamma_{\\rm nth}/\\theta$\ncontrols $\\epsilon_e$, the latter limit implies that at least $\\epsilon_e\n\\approx 10\\%$ of the shock energy is transferred to the nonthermal electrons.\nThese results are almost insensitive to the shock velocity $\\gamma_{\\rm sh}$,\nbut radio observations indicate $\\gamma_{\\rm sh} \\gtrsim 5$ since for lower\nshock velocities the radio fluxes are overproduced by the Maxwellian electrons.\nIf shocks drive the particle energisation, our findings indicate that they\noperate in the mildly to fully relativistic regime with efficient electron\nacceleration."}

These perturbations, through a variety of proposed mechanisms,\ncan convert a fraction of the magnetic energy stored in the magnetosphere, as\nwell as the energy injected by crustal activity itself into electromagnetic\nemission, including X-ray bursts and fast radio bursts. Here we provide a first\nglimpse of this process by coupling magneto-elastic dynamics simulations of the\ncrust to fully three-dimensional relativistic resistive force-free\nelectrodynamic simulations of the magnetosphere. Our simulations demonstrate\nthat the elastodynamical motions of the surface launch a series of fast\nmagnetosonic and Alfv\\'en waves into the magnetosphere. These waves rapidly\nenter a nonlinear regime, ultimately giving rise to a wide range of phenomena,\nincluding monster shock formation, relativistic blast waves, trapped Alfv\\'en\nwaves, nonlinear Alfv\\'en wave ejecta, and transient equatorial current sheets\ninteracting with these waves. After the initial nonlinear phase, the\nmagnetosphere is partially combed out, resembling a strongly perturbed split\nmonopole configuration. Our results can offer hints and potential constraints\non fast radio burst emission mechanisms, in particular for hyperactive\nrepeating sources, by placing tight bounds on energy conversion efficiency, and\npossible quasi-periodic imprints on magnetospheric waves by elastic\noscillations of the crust."}

### [1] [On the Energy Distribution of the Galactic Center Excess' Sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17804)
*Florian List,Yujin Park,Nicholas L. Rodd,Eve Schoen,Florian Wolf*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文探讨了银河中心过剩（GCE）的起源，通过神经网络辅助的模拟推理方法结合空间和光谱数据，发现GCE可能是由大量极暗的点源或真正的弥散发射引起。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GCE起源的争议，尤其是点源假设与暗物质湮灭假设之间的矛盾。

Method: 采用神经网络辅助的模拟推理方法，结合空间和光谱数据进行分析。

Result: 光谱信息显示点源假设需要极大量的点源（约10^5个），远超过先前分析的数百个点源。

Conclusion: GCE更可能是弥散发射或由大量极暗点源组成，支持暗物质湮灭的可能性。

Abstract: The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) remains one of the defining mysteries
uncovered by the Fermi $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope. Although it may yet herald
the discovery of annihilating dark matter, weighing against that conclusion are
analyses showing the spatial structure of the emission appears more consistent
with a population of dim point sources. Technical limitations have restricted
prior analyses to studying the point-source hypothesis purely spatially. All
spectral information that could help disentangle the GCE from the complex and
uncertain astrophysical emission was discarded. We demonstrate that a neural
network-aided simulation-based inference approach can overcome such limitations
and thereby confront the point source explanation of the GCE with spatial and
spectral data. The addition is profound: energy information drives the putative
point sources to be significantly dimmer, indicating either the GCE is truly
diffuse in nature or made of an exceptionally large number of sources.
Quantitatively, for our best fit background model, the excess is essentially
consistent with Poisson emission as predicted by dark matter. If the excess is
instead due to point sources, our median prediction is ${\cal O}(10^5)$ sources
in the Galactic Center, or more than 35,000 sources at 90% confidence, both
significantly larger than the hundreds of sources preferred by earlier
point-source analyses of the GCE.

TL;DR: 论文对罕见的超巨星B[e]星Wd1-9进行了详细的X射线研究，揭示了其14天的周期性信号和双星系统的特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超巨星B[e]星的演化路径尚不明确，Wd1-9因其尘埃包裹的真实性质未解，需通过X射线研究揭示其本质。

Method: 利用36次Chandra观测和8次存档数据（总计1.1 Ms），分析X射线颜色、光谱和长期变异性。

Result: 发现14天的周期性信号，表明其为双星系统；X射线光谱显示其具有类似Wolf-Rayet双星的特征。

Conclusion: Wd1-9可能是一个经历了早期Case B质量转移的WR+OB双星系统，其超巨星B[e]分类可能源于周围物质的发射。

Abstract: Supergiant B[e] (sgB[e]) stars are exceptionally rare objects, with only a
handful of confirmed examples in the Milky Way. The evolutionary pathways
leading to the sgB[e] phase remain largely debated, highlighting the need for
additional observations. The sgB[e] star Wd1-9, located in the massive cluster
Westerlund 1 (Wd1), is enshrouded in a dusty cocoon--likely the result of past
eruptive activity--leaving its true nature enigmatic. We present the most
detailed X-ray study of Wd1-9 to date, using X-rays that pierce through its
cocoon with the aim to uncover its nature and evolutionary state. We utilize 36
Chandra observations of Wd1 from the 'Extended Westerlund 1 and 2 Open Clusters
Survey' (EWOCS), plus eight archival datasets, totalling 1.1 Ms. This dataset
allows investigation of long-term variability and periodicity in Wd1-9, while
X-ray colours and spectra are analysed over time to uncover patterns that shed
light on its nature. Wd1-9 exhibits significant long-term X-ray variability,
within which we identify a strong 14-day periodic signal. We interpret this as
the orbital period, marking the first period determination for the system. The
X-ray spectrum of Wd1-9 is thermal and hard (kT approximately 3.0 keV),
resembling the spectra of bright Wolf-Rayet (WR) binaries in Wd1, while a
strong Fe emission line at 6.7 keV indicates hot plasma from a colliding-wind
X-ray binary. Wd1-9, with evidence of past mass loss, circumbinary material, a
hard X-ray spectrum, and a newly detected 14-day period, displays all the
hallmarks of a binary--likely a WR+OB--that recently underwent early Case B
mass transfer. Its sgB[e] classification is likely phenomenological reflecting
emission from the dense circumbinary material. This places Wd1-9 in a rarely
observed phase, possibly revealing a newly formed WN star, bridging the gap
between immediate precursors and later evolutionary stages in Wd1.

*Hyerin Cho,Ben S. Prather,Ramesh Narayan,Kung-Yi Su,Priyamvada Natarajan*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的多区域方法，用于模拟黑洞吸积和反馈，发现反馈效率主要由黑洞自旋决定，而非星系性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟黑洞吸积和反馈涉及极大尺度范围，现有方法难以实现全局动态稳态。

Method: 改进多区域方法，应用于自旋为0.9的黑洞，测试不同邦迪半径下的吸积和反馈效率。

Result: 反馈效率约为30%，与邦迪半径无关，主要由黑洞自旋决定。

Conclusion: 黑洞反馈效率主要由自旋决定，为宇宙学模拟提供了子网格模型。

Abstract: Simulating black hole (BH) accretion and feedback from the horizon to
galactic scales is extremely challenging, as it involves a vast range of
scales. Recently, our multizone method has successfully achieved global
dynamical steady-states of hot accretion flows in three-dimensional general
relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations by tracking the
bidirectional interaction between a non-spinning BH and its host galaxy. In
this paper, we present technical improvements to the method and apply it to
spin $a_*=0.9$ BHs, which power relativistic jets. We first test the new
multizone set-up with a smaller Bondi radius, $R_B\approx400\,r_g$, where $r_g$
is the gravitational radius. The strongly magnetized accretion launches a
relativistic jet with an intermediate feedback efficiency $\eta\sim30\,\%$, in
between that of a prograde ($\eta\sim100\,\%$) and retrograde ($\eta\sim
10\,\%$) torus. Interestingly, both prograde and retrograde simulations also
eventually converge to the same intermediate efficiency when evolved long
enough, as accumulated magnetic fields remove gas rotation. We then extend
strongly magnetized simulations to larger Bondi radii, $R_B\approx
2\times10^3,~2\times 10^4,~2\times 10^5\,r_g$. We find that the BH accretion
rate $\dot{M}$ is suppressed with respect to the Bondi rate $\dot{M}_B$ as
$\dot{M}/\dot{M}_B\propto R_B^{-1/2}$. However, despite some variability, the
time-averaged feedback efficiency is $\eta\sim30\,\%$, independent of $R_B$.
This suggests that BH feedback efficiency in hot accretion flows is mainly
governed by the BH spin ($a_*$) rather than by the galactic properties ($R_B$).
From these first-principles simulations, we provide a feedback subgrid
prescription for cosmological simulations: $\dot{E}_{\rm
fb}=2\times10^{-3}[R_B/(2\times10^5\,r_g)]^{-1/2}\dot{M}_Bc^2$ for BH spin
$a_*=0.9$.

### [4] [Afterglow Linear Polarization Signatures from Steep GRB Jets: Implications for Orphan Afterglows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17826)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 该论文研究了伽马射线暴（GRB）喷流的角结构及其余辉的多波段光变曲线和偏振特性，通过联合建模解决了观测中的参数退化问题，并提供了峰值偏振水平的解析近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRB喷流的角结构对其发射机制和传播过程至关重要，但仅通过光变曲线和宽波段光谱分析存在参数退化问题。联合建模光变曲线和偏振可以解决这一问题。

Method: 研究团队分析了陡峭、核心主导的GRB喷流的余辉线偏振和通量密度演化，探讨了视角、喷流角能量结构和磁场配置对光变和偏振曲线的影响。

Result: 研究发现峰值偏振水平出现在光变曲线转折点附近，并提供了其解析近似。此外，该方法可用于区分“脏火球”和远轴视角的陡峭喷流。

Conclusion: 通过联合建模光变曲线和偏振，可以更准确地确定GRB喷流的性质，并应用于实际观测（如AT2021lfa候选体）。

Abstract: Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are the strongest explosions in the Universe, and are
powered by initially ultra-relativistic jets. The angular profile of GRB jets
encodes important information about their launching and propagation near the
central source, and can be probed through their afterglow emission. Detailed
analysis of the multi-wavelength afterglow light curves of recent GRBs indeed
shows evidence for an extended angular structure beyond the jet's narrow core.
The afterglow emission is determined by the jet angular structure, our viewing
angle, and the magnetic field structure behind the shock, often leading to
degeneracies when considering the light curves and broad-band spectrum alone.
Such degeneracies can be lifted with joint modeling of the afterglow light
curves and polarization. In this work we study the evolution of the afterglow
linear polarization and flux density from steep, core-dominated GRB jets, where
most of their energy resides within a narrow core. We explore the dependence of
the light and polarization curves on the viewing angle, jet angular energy
structure and magnetic field configuration, and provide an analytical
approximation for the peak polarization level, which occurs at a time close to
that of a break in the light curve. Finally, we demonstrate how our results can
be used to determine the nature of orphan GRB afterglows, distinguishing
between a quasi-spherical "dirty fireball" and a steep jets viewed far off-axis
and apply them on the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) detected orphan afterglow
candidate AT2021lfa.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究探讨了旋转大质量恒星（坍缩星）在坍缩失败后形成吸积盘时产生的中微子和引力波信号。通过模拟计算，发现这些信号在特定阶段可被现有和未来探测器检测到。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索坍缩星吸积盘的非球形振荡及其产生的中微子和引力波信号，以了解恒星坍缩过程的物理机制和可观测性。

Method: 使用全局轴对称粘性流体动力学模拟，计算中微子和引力波信号（物质四极矩）。

Result: 中微子信号在NDAF阶段最强，可被IceCube在10-100 kpc范围内检测；引力波信号在星系内可被现有和下一代地面探测器检测。

Conclusion: 坍缩星吸积盘的中微子和引力波信号提供了研究恒星坍缩动力学的新途径，未来探测器将进一步提升探测能力。

Abstract: We investigate the neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals from
accretion disks formed during the failed collapse of a rotating massive star (a
collapsar). Following black hole formation, a neutrino-cooled, shocked
accretion disk forms, which displays non-spherical oscillations for a period of
seconds before becoming advective and exploding the star. We compute the
neutrino and GW signals (matter quadrupole) from collapsar disks using global
axisymmetric, viscous hydrodynamic simulations. The neutrino signal with
typical energies of O$(10)$ MeV is maximal during the neutrino-cooled (NDAF)
phase that follows shock formation. This phase lasts for a few seconds and is
easily detectable within O$(10-100)$ kpc by the IceCube Neutrino Telescope.
Additional neutrino signatures from a precursor equatorial shock and by
stochastic accretion plumes during the advective phase are detectable within
the galaxy. The GW signal during the NDAF phase is detectable in the galaxy by
current and next-generation ground-based observatories. The explosion (memory)
GW signal is similar to that of standard core-collapse supernovae and can be
probed with a deci-Hertz space-based detector. Shock oscillations during the
NDAF phase impart time variations with frequency O$(10-100)$ Hz to the neutrino
and GW signals, encoding information about the shock dynamics and inner disk.
These time variations can be detectable in neutrinos by IceCube within
O$(1-10)$ kpc depending on progenitor model, flavor transformation scenario,
and detailed properties of the angular momentum transport mechanism.

Motivation: 研究4U 1907+09的偏振特性，以了解其几何结构和耀斑对其影响。

Method: 使用IXPE进行两次观测，结合光谱偏振分析，研究相位平均和相位分辨的偏振特性。

Result: 首次观测偏振度6.0±1.6%，第二次2.2±1.6%；能量依赖性偏振角变化显著；耀斑对几何结构无显著影响。

Conclusion: 4U 1907+09的几何结构稳定，耀斑不影响其偏振特性。

Abstract: We present observations of the accretion-powered X-ray pulsar (XRP) 4U
1907+09, conducted with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) that
delivers the first high-quality polarization measurements of this source. 4U
1907+09 was observed twice during its brightest periods close to the
periastron. We observe a stronger polarization in the first observation, with
the phase-averaged polarization degree (PD) of $6.0 \pm 1.6\%$ and polarization
angle (PA) of $69^\circ \pm 8^\circ$. In contrast, the second observation
provides weaker constraints on the polarimetric properties, with a PD=$2.2 \pm
1.6\%$ and a PA=$46^\circ \pm 23^\circ$, as determined from the
spectral-polarimetric analysis. Combining the data from both observations
results in a PD=$3.7 \pm 1.1\%$ and a PA=$63^\circ \pm 9^\circ$. We detect an
energy-dependent PA in the phase-averaged analyses with a significance of 1.7
$\sigma$. In the phase-resolved analyses, we observe a potential PA rotation by
approximately $90^\circ$ between adjacent energy bands (4--5 and 5--6 keV)
within the single phase bin of 0.25--0.375. We also investigate the influence
of short flares on the polarization properties of this source. The results
suggest that flares do not significantly affect the energy-phase-dependent PA,
implying that the pulsar's geometry remains stable during flare events.

### [8] [Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars as high-energy neutrino sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17908)
*Alberto Moretti,Alessandro Caccianiga*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究发现，高能中微子可能与平谱射电类星体（FSRQs）相关，而非射电宁静类星体（RQ QSOs），且发射机制可能与相对论性喷流有关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高能中微子的天体物理来源尚不明确，尤其是与活动星系核（AGN）的具体关联机制。

Method: 通过分析IceCat-1中微子事件与Sloan数字巡天（SDSS）类星体目录的关联性，区分射电宁静类星体和平谱射电类星体（FSRQs）。

Result: FSRQs与中微子位置存在中等显著相关性（2.7σ），且高赤纬事件分布与随机分布显著偏离（4σ）。

Conclusion: 大部分IceCube观测到的中微子可能由FSRQs产生，发射机制可能与相对论性喷流相关。

Abstract: The astrophysical sources responsible for the production of high energy
neutrinos remain largely uncertain. The strongest associations suggest a
correlation between neutrinos and active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, it is
still unclear which specific regions and mechanisms of the accreting
supermassive black hole (SMBH) are responsible for their production. In this
paper we investigate the correlation between the positions of IceCat-1 neutrino
events and a large, optically selected QSO catalog extracted from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. Within this sample, we distinguish radio-quiet QSOs from
flat-spectrum radio QSOs (FSRQs)based on radio emission data from the Cosmic
Lens All Sky Survey (CLASS) catalog. While the associations between neutrino
events and radio-quiet QSOs are consistent with being all random matches, FSRQs
exhibit a moderately significant correlation (2.7 sigma) with neutrino
positions. Additionally we observe that the distribution of minimum distances
between neutrino events and FSRQs differs significantly for events at
declinations above and below 20 deg. In particular, using the KS test, we find
that the high-declination event distribution shows a strong deviation (4 sigma)
from a random distribution. We interpret all these results as an indication
that a large fraction (> 60%) of the neutrino events observed by IceCube could
be produced by the FSRQ and that the emission mechanism is likely related to
the relativistic jets rather than the "radio-quiet" (RQ) component of these
sources, such as the accretion disk or corona.

Result: 发现了一个尺寸较大的环状星云，其Hα和[O III]发射特征与红外数据有部分重合。

Conclusion: 更深的成像技术可能有助于发现更多WR环状星云，从而提升对其形成机制和频率的认识。

Abstract: We present deep H$\alpha$ and [O III] images of the ejecta rich nebulosity
associated with the suspected runaway and binary Wolf-Rayet star WR~71 (HD
143414). In H$\alpha$ emission, the nebula appears as a crescent shaped, broken
ring of clumpy emission some $9' \times 13'$ in angular size centered to the
south and west of the WR star. At a Gaia estimated distance of 4.27 kpc, the
nebula has physical dimensions of $11 \times 16$ pc making it one of the larger
known ejecta rich WR ring nebulae. Our [O III] image also show considerable
surrounding faint nebulosity much of which may be unrelated to the WR star. A
comparison of the nebula's optical appearance with that seen in WISE 22 $\mu$m
data shows infrared coincidence with the nebula's brightest [O III] emission
features. Deep H$\alpha$ and [O III] images like those presented here suggests
that new and substantially deeper imaging reconnaissance of WR star nebulae
compared to earlier surveys may lead to additional WR ring nebula detections,
thereby enhancing our understanding on the frequency and formation of WR ring
nebulae.

Abstract: Fermi-type shear particle acceleration is a promising mechanism for
sustaining ultra-relativistic particles along the kilo-parsec scale jets in
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). We explore the possibility of
synchrotron-limited electron acceleration in mildly relativistic shearing flows
and present numerical solutions to the corresponding particle transport
equation. We compare our findings with analytical calculations to infer an
effective electron cutoff energy, and discuss the relationship to a simplified
box model treatment. The results show that mildly relativistic large-scale jets
offer a suitable environment for distributed electron acceleration beyond
Lorentz factors of $\gamma_e \sim 10^8$.

Conclusion: PSR J0007+7303的glitch行为独特，为理解中子星壳层-超流体相互作用提供了新视角。

Abstract: The study of pulsar glitches provides a unique window into the internal
structure and dynamic processes of neutron stars. PSR J0007+7303, a very bright
gamma-ray pulsar, is the first pulsar discovered by the Fermi-LAT telescope. In
this paper, we present the 15 years of timing results of this pulsar using the
Fermi-LAT data. We identified nine glitches, five of which are newly
discovered. Among these, two are small glitches, occurring between the three
previously reported ones, while the other four are large glitches. The glitches
exhibit fractional frequency changes ranging from 15 x 10^-9 to 1238 x 10^-9,
with intervals of approximately 1-2 years between events. Uniquely, this pulsar
shows no exponential recovery behavior following any glitch, setting it apart
from most glitching pulsars. Furthermore, no significant changes were observed
in the gamma-ray pulse profile, flux, or phase-averaged spectra before and
after glitches, indicating the stability of the pulsar's emission properties
despite internal changes. A parametric analysis of the glitches yielded a
fractional moment of inertia of the crustal superfluid involved in glitches as
1.06 percent, which matches extremely well with previous statistical work if
the non-dissipative entrainment effect is not considered and strongly supports
the internal origin of these glitches. These results highlight the distinct
glitch behavior of PSR J0007+7303 and offer valuable insights into the
crust-superfluid interaction in neutron stars. The physical origin of no
exponential recovery is also discussed.

TL;DR: 论文分析了M82中心星暴区的非热辐射，结合Fermi-LAT和VERITAS数据，通过模型确定了高能伽马射线的主要来源为π介子衰变，并估算了宇宙射线和磁场的能量密度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究M82中心星暴区的非热辐射特性，以理解宇宙射线和磁场的相互作用及其能量分布。

Method: 结合16.3年的Fermi-LAT数据和VERITAS数据，建立模型分析非热辐射，校准宇宙射线电子谱，并考虑所有相关辐射过程。

Result: >10 GeV的辐射主要来自π介子衰变，0.1-10 GeV的辐射是π介子衰变和康普顿散射的混合，<0.1 GeV的辐射来自轻子过程。宇宙射线和磁场的能量密度接近平衡。

Conclusion: M82中心星暴区的非热辐射主要由宇宙射线驱动，且宇宙射线和磁场的能量密度处于平衡状态。

Abstract: Diffuse non-thermal (NT) emission from the central starburst (CSB) of M82 has
been measured at radio, X-ray and gamma-ray energies. Far-infrared (FIR),
radio, and X-ray emission maps are mutually consistent, with radio and X-ray
emissions spectrally similar - suggesting the latter to be Compton/FIR
radiation. We present our analysis of 16.3 years of Fermi-LAT measurements,
which - combined with newly-published VERITAS data - constitute the deepest,
most extensive currently available gamma-ray dataset on M82. We model the NT
radio to gamma-ray emission of the CSB as due to relativistic particles (CR).
Key features of our models are the identification of the >50 GeV emission as
pionic and the use of X-ray and radio emission to calibrate the CRe spectrum.
This enables determination of the zero-point and slope of the CRp (and
secondary CRe) spectrum, and meaningful estimates of the energy densities of CR
and magnetic fields. We consider all relevant radiative processes involving CR,
and use published detailed descriptions of the soft radiation fields in the CSB
region - the most important of which is the FIR field, modeled as a graybody.
Our SED modeling indicates that 1) the >10 GeV emission is mostly pionic, 2)
the 0.1 < E/GeV < 10 emission is a combination of pionic and Compton/starlight
(and subdominant NT bremss), 3) the <0.1 GeV gamma-ray emission is leptonic,
and 4) the radio spectrum arises from primary and secondary CRe synchrotron at
comparable levels: the corresponding CRe populations are described by a PL and
a curved spectrum, respectively. Averaged over the FIR graybody models, the CRp
spectral index and energy density are 2.3 and 385 eV/cm3 (for n(H) = 200
1/cm3), the primary-CRe and CRp maximum energies are 30 GeV and 7 TeV, and the
magnetic field is B = 120 uG. The derived CR and B energy densities are in
equipartition.

Abstract: We analyze the influence of hyperons in binary neutron star mergers
considering several different equations of state that include hyperons. By
running a large set of simulations, we study the impact of the thermally
produced hyperons on the gravitational-wave spectral features, the temperature
evolution of the remnant, the mass ejecta and the threshold mass for prompt
collapse to a black hole. Models with hyperons tend to stand out in the
relation between the dominant postmerger gravitational-wave frequency and the
tidal deformability of massive stars. Moreover, the averaged temperature of the
remnant is reduced for hyperonic models. The mass ejection of the mergers is
tentatively enhanced when hyperons are present in comparison to nucleonic EoSs
leading to similar stellar properties of cold neutron stars, whereas the
threshold mass for prompt black-hole formation is reduced by about
0.05~$M_\odot$ compared to the nucleonic models.

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析Fermi GBM Burst Catalog，利用GRB 170817A和GRB 150101B作为参考事件，结合降维和聚类技术，成功识别出与双中子星合并相关的短伽马射线暴（sGRBs）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短伽马射线暴（sGRBs）与致密天体合并（如双中子星或中子星-黑洞系统）相关，研究旨在区分与合并相关的sGRBs与其他GRBs，以更高效地寻找其电磁对应体。

Method: 采用降维技术（如Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection）和聚类分析，基于伽马射线观测特性（T90、Epeak和fluence）对GRBs进行分类。

Result: 成功识别出一组与合并相关的sGRBs，并通过与其他方法识别的候选事件对比验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于更准确地识别与致密天体合并相关的sGRBs，为多信使天文学研究提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Short gamma-ray bursts are expected to be associated with compact object
mergers, such as binary neutron star or neutron star-black hole systems, and
are key high-energy multimessenger events. The detection of GRB 170817A,
coinciding with the gravitational wave signal GW170817 from a BNS merger,
confirmed the link between sGRBs and compact object mergers. Similarly, GRB
150101B displayed remarkable similarities to GRB 170817A, further supporting
its association with compact binary mergers. The objective of this study is to
uncover the intrinsic properties that differentiate merger-associated sGRBs
from other GRBs by analyzing the Fermi GBM Burst Catalog and using GRB 170817A
and GRB 150101B as reference events, enhancing our ability to select events
from this class and promptly to search for their electromagnetic counterpart.
We employed a clustering technique to classify GRBs based on their observed
properties in gamma-rays (T90, Epeak and fluence). Prior to clustering, we
tested three dimensionality reduction techniques, among which Uniform Manifold
Approximation and Projection demonstrated the best performance making it the
preferred technique for our analysis. This combination of dimensionality
reduction and clustering analysis allowed us to group GRBs with similar
characteristics, with a focus on identifying those most likely associated with
BNS mergers. Our analysis successfully identified a cluster of sGRBs events
with characteristics consistent with sGRB merger-associated. A comparison
between our sample of candidates and known kilonova candidates associated with
sGRBs, identified through other methodologies, further validated our approach.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文研究了黑洞X射线双星中的准周期振荡（QPOs），发现其与日冕几何结构变化相关，并通过光谱-时序分析揭示了QPO硬延迟与能量带的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解QPOs的起源及其与日冕几何结构的关系，尤其是在高倾角黑洞X射线双星中的表现。

Method: 利用NICER数据集对MAXI J1820+070在2018年爆发期间的亮硬态进行光谱-时序分析，比较不同能量带的QPO延迟和相干性。

Result: 发现QPO硬延迟在软能量带与硬能量带之间存在显著变化，且与日冕几何结构的垂直扩展变化相关。

Conclusion: QPOs可能与日冕几何结构的动态变化有关，尤其是在高倾角系统中。

Abstract: Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are observed in the hard state of many
black hole X-ray binaries. Although their origin is unknown, they are strongly
associated with the corona, of which the geometry is also subject to
discussion. We present a thorough spectral-timing analysis of QPOs and
broadband noise in the high-inclination BHXRB MAXI J1820+070, using the rich
NICER data set of the source in the bright hard state of its outburst in 2018.
We find that there is a large QPO hard lag between soft energy bands with
significant disc emission and harder coronal power-law bands, which is absent
when measuring lags between energy bands dominated by the coronal emission. The
QPO lags between a soft band (with significant disc emission) and harder
coronal power-law bands vary significantly with power-law flux, on time-scales
of (tens of) seconds or a few QPO cycles, especially at QPO frequencies
$\lesssim0.3$ Hz. At the same time, the QPO is found to be related to a
decreased coherence between energy bands with significant disc emission and
harder bands both at and below the QPO frequency, suggesting the QPO mechanism
filters out part of the variability. Similar patterns in the
frequency-dependent lags and coherence are observed in the BHXRB MAXI
J1803-298, which is a (dipping) high-inclination source, but not in the
low-inclination source GX 339-4. We suggest that these findings may be evidence
of changes in the vertical extent of the corona on time-scales slightly longer
than the QPO cycle.

Result: 下一代探测器可能区分不同耦合模型，并约束时序噪声的起源（磁层或内部过程）。

Conclusion: 观测验证提出的场景将为脉冲星引力波发射的物理机制提供重要信息。

Abstract: Neutron stars emitting continuous gravitational waves may be regarded as
gravitational pulsars, in the sense that it could be possible to track the
evolution of their rotational period with long-baseline observations of
next-generation gravitational wave interferometers. Assuming that the pulsar's
electromagnetic signal is tracked and allows us to monitor the pulsar's spin
evolution, we provide a physical interpretation of the possible observed
correlation between this timing solution and its gravitational counterpart, if
the system is also detected in gravitational waves. In particular, we show that
next-generation detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, could have the
sensitivity to discern different models for the coupling between the superfluid
and normal components of the neutron star and constrain the origin of timing
noise (whether due to magnetospheric or internal processes). Observational
confirmation of one of the proposed scenarios would therefore provide valuable
information on the physics of gravitational wave emission from pulsars.

(IACT) to detect Very High Energy (VHE) gamma rays in the 1-300 TeV energy
range. We present recent SST-1M observations, data analysis, and the results of
preliminary physical modeling of Mrk 421's emission mechanisms.

Motivation: 研究EP250108a和SN 2025kg的独特观测特征（如氦吸收线、晚期宽Hα线和早期光变曲线凸起），以揭示其物理起源和前身星性质。

Method: 通过喷流-茧模型解释观测现象，结合磁星能量注入假设，推断前身星的物理参数（如质量、半径、旋转周期等）。

Result: 模型成功解释了观测特征，推测前身星为低质量氦星，具有快速旋转和扩展氦包层，并可能通过双星演化获得角动量。

Conclusion: EP250108a/SN 2025kg的观测支持喷流-茧模型，并挑战了传统的化学均匀演化通道，表明双星演化可能是其前身星快速旋转的来源。

Abstract: SN\,2025kg, linked to EP250108a, is among the brightest broad-lined Type Ic
supernova (SN Ic-BL) known, showing unique helium absorptions, a late-time
broad H$\alpha$, and an early bump. In this {\em{Letter}}, we propose a
jet-cocoon origin to explain EP250108a as off-axis cooling emission from a
mildly relativistic inner cocoon viewed at $\sim45^\circ$ and the early bump of
SN\,2025kg as the outer cocoon cooling emission, both constraining an energy of
$\sim(1-2)\times10^{52}{\rm{erg}}$ and a progenitor radius of $\sim5\,R_\odot$.
To explain SN\,2025kg's exceptionally luminous peak, potential energy injection
into the $\sim2.5\,M_\odot$ ejecta from a magnetar with initial period
$\sim1.7\,{\rm{ms}}$ and magnetic field $\sim2\times10^{15}{\rm{G}}$ may be
required, implying a rapidly rotating $\sim4\,M_\odot$ progenitor. Thus, the
progenitor may be a low-mass helium star with an extended helium envelope,
supported by helium absorption lines and an inferred weak pre-SN wind.
Hydrogen-rich material may reside in the inner ejecta layers, as suggested by
the late-time broad H$\alpha$, possibly originating from main-sequence
companion material evaporated by the magnetar wind. Since the observed
near-solar metallicity challenges the popular quasi-chemically homogeneous
evolution channel, the rapidly rotating helium-star progenitor of
EP250108a/SN\,2025kg might attain angular momentum by being tidally spun up by
a main-sequence companion in a close binary formed through isolated binary
evolution.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索早期星系对再电离的贡献，以及如何通过pkSZ效应和莱曼α森林测量约束再电离历史和源的性质。

Method: 使用辐射传输模拟，结合pkSZ效应和莱曼α森林测量，分析再电离历史和源的性质。

Result: pkSZ功率谱振幅与再电离开始时间强相关，但源模型的变异性削弱了这种相关性。通过莱曼α森林不透明度和pkSZ功率谱形状可打破退化性。

Conclusion: 未来pkSZ测量将与JWST观测互补，提升对宇宙黎明附近电离源的理解。

Abstract: A key result from JWST's first cycles is that galaxy formation was well
underway by $z=10$. The implications of these early galaxies for reionization
are less clear, however. The CMB is one of the few windows into the ionization
state of the IGM during reionization's first half, providing an important probe
of the ionizing photon sources at those times. Meanwhile, measurements of the
Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in the spectra of high-$z$ quasars have improved to the
level of tightly constraining the timing of reionization's end. In this paper,
we use radiative transfer simulations to explore how measurements of the patchy
kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (pkSZ) effect, when combined with Lyman-$\alpha$
forest measurements, can be used to constrain the early stages of reionization
and the nature of its sources. For a given source model, we find that the
amplitude of the pkSZ power spectra strongly correlates with the start time of
reionization, and constrains the number of ionizing photons produced by the
high-$z$ source population. Allowing for variations in the source model, this
correlation is weakened by a degeneracy between the reionization history and
the effects of source clustering. However, we demonstrate two potential ways of
breaking this degeneracy using: (1) measurements of large-scale fluctuations in
the Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity at $z=5-6$, and/or; (2) the shape of the pkSZ
power spectrum measured in future CMB surveys. Models with highly clustered
sources yield steeper slopes in the pkSZ power around $\ell = 3,000$, so
measurements at additional angular scales can be used to break the
history-clustering degeneracy. Our results highlight how future pkSZ
measurements will complement JWST observations to improve our understanding of
the ionizing sources near cosmic dawn.

Result: 对于合理的弦参数值，可以重现JWST观测到的“小红点”的丰度。

Conclusion: 宇宙弦环可能是高红移黑洞形成的来源之一，解释了JWST的观测结果。

Abstract: Cosmic strings appear in many well-motivated extensions to the standard model
of particle physics. If they exist, an abundant population of compact objects
known as cosmic string loops permeate the Universe at all times, providing a
secondary source of density perturbations that are large amplitude and
non-gaussian in nature. In general, these loops are not stationary in the rest
frame of the dark matter, thus their relative velocities will typically seed
both spherical and filamentary overdensities in the matter era. Building upon
previous work, we provide an improved framework to compute the complete halo
mass function for these string seeded overdensities, valid for any loop
velocity distribution. Using this mass function, we also compute the subset of
halos capable of undergoing a direct collapse, forming a population of black
holes with initial mass $10^{4-5} \, M_{\odot}$ at high redshifts.
Interestingly, for reasonable values of the string parameters, one can
reproduce the abundance of ``Little Red Dots" as inferred by JWST.

Motivation: 探索宇宙距离-红移关系中的异常是否源于FLRW对称性的偏离，而非暗能量演化。

Method: 利用BAO观测的横向和视线距离，分析各向异性膨胀率，并研究非FLRW模型。

Result: 非FLRW模型（如球状超密度）能解释BAO、超新星和CMB数据，与FLRW模型在统计上无显著差异，但某些数据挑战FLRW框架（如Pantheon+数据2.8σ，DESY5数据5.2σ）。

Conclusion: 结果呼吁重新审视FLRW范式在精确宇宙学中的适用性，暗示可能存在微妙的非均匀性或各向异性。

Abstract: Discrepancies between distance measurements and $\Lambda$CDM predictions
reveal notable features in the distance-redshift relation, possibly suggesting
the presence of an evolving dark energy component. Given the central role of
the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric in modeling
cosmological distances, we investigate here whether these features instead
point to a possible departure from the fundamental FLRW symmetries. Exploiting
the transverse and line-of-sight distances provided by baryonic acoustic
oscillations (BAO) observations, we demonstrate that observed distances hint at
a slight but systematic preference for an anisotropic expansion rate emerging
regardless of the dark energy model considered. Leveraging this non-FLRW
feature, we investigate an inhomogeneous extension of the $\Lambda$CDM model
that naturally provides an anisotropic expansion rate. Our analysis
demonstrates that models featuring spherical overdensities can explain BAO,
supernova, and cosmic microwave background data, providing fits statistically
indistinguishable from those obtained with a phantom dark energy scenario. When
Pantheon+ data is considered, our analysis challenges the FLRW framework at
$2.8\sigma$ and yields scenarios that can be interpreted as subtle but
non-negligible deviations from the FLRW metric. When DESY5 supernovae are
considered instead, deviations are notably more significant, yielding scenarios
that mildly violate the Copernican principle and exclude the FLRW assumption at
$5.2\sigma$. Overall, our results motivate a more in-depth investigation of
whether the perfectly homogeneous and isotropic FLRW paradigm can still be
assumed to accurately predict cosmological distances in the era of precision
cosmology.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of a variational autoencoder (VAE), a deep
generative model, to compress and generate images of dark matter density fields
from $\Lambda$CDM like cosmological simulations. The VAE learns a compact,
low-dimensional representation of the large-scale structure, enabling both
accurate reconstruction and generation of statistically realistic samples. We
evaluated the generated images by comparing their power spectra to those of
real simulations and the theoretical $\Lambda$CDM prediction, finding strong
agreement with the state-of-the-art simulations. In addition, the VAE provides
a fast and scalable method for generating synthetic cosmological data, making
it a valuable tool for data augmentation. These capabilities can accelerate the
development and training of more advanced machine learning models for
cosmological analysis, particularly in scenarios where large-scale simulations
are computationally expensive. Our results highlight the potential for
generative artificial intelligence as a practical bridge between physical
modeling and modern deep learning in cosmology.

Abstract: Determining cosmological parameters with high precision, as well as resolving
current tensions in their values derived from low and high redshift probes, is
one of the main objectives of the new generation of cosmological surveys. The
combination of complementary probes in terms of parameter degeneracies and
systematics is key to achieving these ambitious scientific goals. In this
context, determining the optimal survey configuration for an analysis that
combines galaxy clustering, weak lensing, and galaxy-galaxy lensing, the
so-called 3x2pt analysis, remains an open problem. In this paper, we present an
efficient and flexible end-to-end pipeline to optimise the sample selection for
3x2pt analyses in an automated way. Our pipeline is articulated in two main
steps: we first consider a self-organising map to determine the photometric
redshifts of a simulated galaxy sample. As a proof of method for stage-IV
surveys, we use samples from the DESC Data Challenge 2 catalogue. This allows
us to classify galaxies into tomographic bins based on their colour phenotype
clustering. We then explore different redshift-bin edge configurations for weak
lensing only as well as 3x2pt analyses in a novel way. Our method explores
multiple configurations of perturbed redshift-bin edges with respect to the
fiducial case in an iterative manner. In particular, we sample tomographic
configurations for the source and lens galaxies separately. We show that, using
this method we quickly converge into an optimised configuration for different
numbers of redshift bins and cosmologies. Our analysis demonstrates that for
stage-IV surveys an optimal tomographic sample selection can increase the
figure of merit of the dark energy (DE) equation of state by a factor of
$\sim$2, comparable to an effective increase in survey area of $\sim$4 for
non-optimal photometric survey analyses.

TL;DR: DESI BAO、Planck CMB和Pantheon+数据显示宇宙膨胀可能存在‘幻影’相（$w_{\rm de}<-1$），但幻影行为可能是暗物质与非幻影暗能量相互作用的有效结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究幻影行为是否由暗物质与暗能量的非引力相互作用引起，而非本质属性。

Method: 假设暗能量的本质状态为‘解冻’类quintessence形式，使用$w_0, w_a$模型描述有效暗能量状态。

Result: 数据支持有效暗能量的幻影跨越，但显著性低；本质状态非幻影。暗物质与暗能量在$z\sim0.3$处存在显著相互作用。

Conclusion: 幻影行为可能是相互作用的结果，本质暗能量非幻影，且相互作用在早期和晚期能量流向相反。

Abstract: Recent results from DESI BAO measurements, together with Planck CMB and
Pantheon+ data, suggest that there may be a `phantom' phase ($w_{\rm de}<-1$)
in the expansion of the Universe. This inference follows when the $w_0, w_a$
parametrization for the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm de}$ is used to
fit the data. Since phantom dark energy in general relativity is unphysical, we
investigate the possibility that the phantom behaviour is not intrinsic, but
effective -- due to a non-gravitational interaction between dark matter and
non-phantom dark energy. To this end, we assume a physically motivated thawing
quintessence-like form of the intrinsic dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm
de}$. Then we use a $w_0, w_a$ model for the \emph{effective} equation of state
of dark energy. We find that the data favours a phantom crossing for the
effective dark energy, but only at low significance. The intrinsic equation of
state of dark energy is non-phantom, without imposing any non-phantom priors. A
nonzero interaction is favoured at more than $3\sigma$ at $z\sim0.3$. The
energy flows from dark matter to dark energy at early times and reverses at
later times.

Conclusion: 连续性方程约束为暗能量有效场论提供了物理意义明确的算子基选择，增强了模型的解释性和适用性。

Abstract: The Effective Field Theory (EFT) of Dark Energy (DE) is a model independent
framework that allows for the description of a wide class of dark energy and
modified gravity models. This is achieved by extending the Hilbert Einstein
action through the introduction of time dependent functions. However, the
choice of these functions and thus the operator basis is not unique. In this
paper, we propose a physically motivated constraint based on the continuity
equation, leading to a continuity equation compatible (CEC) basis that ensures
a clear physical interpretation of the background EFT operators.

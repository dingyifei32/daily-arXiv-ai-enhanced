Motivation: 研究非核TDE 2024tvd的射电和毫米波辐射特性，以理解其喷流机制和演化过程。

Method: 利用VLA、ALMA、ATA、AMI-LA和SMA进行多波段监测，分析射电光变曲线和光谱特性。

Result: 观测到双峰射电光变曲线，首次发现TDE中快速演化的射电辐射，推测喷流可能为单次或两次。

Conclusion: 非核TDE 2024tvd的射电辐射可能由单次或两次喷流引起，喷流性质尚不明确，需进一步研究。

Abstract: We present the first multi-epoch broadband radio and millimeter monitoring of
an off-nuclear TDE using the VLA, ALMA, ATA, AMI-LA, and the SMA. The
off-nuclear TDE 2024tvd exhibits double-peaked radio light curves and the
fastest evolving radio emission observed from a TDE to date. With respect to
the optical discovery date, the first radio flare rises faster than $F_{\rm
\nu} \sim t^{9}$ at $\Delta t = 88-131$ days, and then decays as fast as
$F_{\rm \nu} \sim t^{-6}$. The emergence of a second radio flare is observed at
$\Delta t \approx 194$ days with an initial fast rise of $F_{\rm \nu} \sim
t^{18}$, and an optically thin decline of $F_{\rm \nu} \sim t ^{-12}$. We
interpret these observations in the context of a self-absorbed and free-free
absorbed synchrotron spectrum, while accounting for both synchrotron and
external inverse-Compton cooling. We find that a single prompt outflow cannot
easily explain these observations and it is likely that either there is only
one outflow that was launched at $\Delta t \sim 80$ days, or two distinct
outflows, with the second launched at $\Delta t \sim 170-190$ days. The nature
of these outflows, whether sub-, mildly-, or ultra-relativistic, is still
unclear, and we explore these different scenarios. Finally, we find a temporal
coincidence between the launch time of the first radio-emitting outflow and the
onset of a power-law component in the X-ray spectrum, attributed to
inverse-Compton scattering of thermal photons.

TL;DR: 研究通过蒙特卡洛模拟和统计分析，探讨了双黑洞合并的自旋分布，发现自旋轴抛掷现象在孤立双星形成中显著，而动力学相互作用可能是无抛掷情况下的可行解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨双黑洞合并的自旋分布，以区分其形成通道（孤立双星或混合通道），并验证自旋轴抛掷在黑洞形成中的作用。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛模拟生成合成自旋分布，并通过功能数据分析、核密度估计和三种统计检验与LVK观测数据对比。

Result: 发现自旋轴抛掷在孤立双星形成中显著（p值高达0.882），而无抛掷情况下需约72%动力学相互作用来解释数据。此外，约30%的前身双星存在质量反转。

Conclusion: 研究结果为黑洞形成机制提供了新线索，未来可通过LVK O4+O5及第三代探测器进一步验证。

Abstract: The origin of binary black hole (BH) mergers remains a topic of active
debate, with effective spins (chi_eff) measured by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK)
Collaboration providing crucial insights. In this study, our objective is to
investigate the empirical chi_eff distribution (and constrain individual spin
components) of binary BH mergers and compare them with extensive simulations,
assuming that they originate purely from isolated binaries or a mixture of
formation channels. We explore scenarios using BH kicks with and without the
effect of spin-axis tossing during BH formation. We employ simple yet robust
Monte Carlo simulations of the final core collapse forming the second-born BH,
using minimal assumptions to ensure transparency and reproducibility. The
synthetic chi_eff distribution is compared to the empirical data from LVK
science runs O1-O3 using functional data analysis, kernel density estimations,
and three different statistical tests, accounting for data uncertainties. We
find strong indications for spin-axis tossing during BH formation if LVK
sources are dominated by the isolated binary channel. Simulations with
spin-axis tossing achieve high p-values (up to 0.882) using Kolmogorov-Smirnov,
Cramer-von Mises, and Anderson-Darling tests, while without tossing, all
p-values drop below 0.001 for isolated binaries. A statistically acceptable
solution without tossing, however, emerges if ~72+/-8% of detected binary BH
mergers result from dynamical interactions causing random BH spin directions.
Finally, for an isolated binary origin, we find a preference for mass reversal
in ~30% of the progenitor binaries. Predictions from this study can be tested
with LVK O4+O5 data as well as the 3G detectors, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic
Explorer, enabling improved constraints on formation channel ratios and the
critical question of BH spin-axis tossing.

### [3] [Utilizing Maximum Variability to Discern TDE Emission from AGN Flares](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03889)
*Samaresh Mondal,K. Decker French*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文研究了AGN和TDE在X射线变异性上的差异，提出了一种区分两者的方法，并发现部分eROSITA TDE候选可能实际上是AGN耀斑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AGN活动可能模拟TDE的X射线发射，而未来X射线巡天将检测到大量TDE类似源，如何准确区分TDE和AGN成为关键问题。

Method: 通过交叉匹配XMM-Newton、Swift-XRT点源目录与百万类星体目录及光学选TDE样本，计算X射线结构函数和最大变异性。

Result: AGN的X射线结构函数符合幂律或阻尼幂指数模型，TDE与AGN在短时间尺度（<20天）变异性相似，但在长时间尺度（≥20天）TDE的大尺度变化更罕见。部分eROSITA TDE候选实际为AGN耀斑。

Conclusion: 通过变异性分析可以有效区分TDE和AGN，部分TDE候选可能是AGN耀斑，需进一步验证。

Abstract: X-ray emission arising from active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity may
potentially mimic the expected emission of Tidal disruption events (TDEs).
Ongoing and upcoming wide-field X-ray surveys will detect thousands of TDE-like
sources, and classifying them securely as TDEs or AGNs is a challenging task.
To this aim, we measure the average X-ray variability of AGNs and derive a
threshold of maximum variation as a function of time separating the TDEs from
AGN flares. For the comparison between TDE and AGN X-ray variability, we
cross-match the publicly available XMM-Newton and Swift-XRT point source
catalogs with the Million Quasars Catalog and optically selected TDEs. Then we
compute the X-ray structure function (SF) and maximum variability of the AGN
and TDE samples. The X-ray SF of AGNs has a power-law index
$\gamma\sim0.11-0.14$ when fitted with a simple power-law model. However, the
SF of AGNs is best described by a broken power-law or a power exponential model
with a damping time scale $\tau=950\pm300$ days. The maximum variability
comparison between TDE and simulated AGN light curves indicates they have a
similar order of variation on a time scale of less than 20 days. However, at a
longer time scale of ~20 days or more, the large-scale variations expected from
power-law-like decay in TDEs become less frequent in AGNs. Furthermore, we
compare the maximum variability of eROSITA TDE candidates with AGN, finding
that many of the eROSITA-DE TDE candidates are consistent with flares from
AGNs, and may not be TDEs.

### [4] [Instability windows of relativistic r-modes in stably stratified neutron stars with hyperonic cores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04226)
*K. Y. Kraav,M. E. Gusakov,E. M. Kantor*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究了$r$-mode不稳定性窗口，考虑了超子和非等熵物质对体粘度的增强作用，并评估了核子配对效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索$r$-mode不稳定性窗口，以理解引力波探测中的潜在目标。

Method: 结合超子和非等熵物质的体粘度增强机制，计算不稳定性窗口，并考虑核子配对效应。

Result: 超子物质的体粘度可能在快速旋转且中等温度的中子星中稳定$r$-mode。

Conclusion: 研究结果对引力波观测和中子星物理有重要意义。

Abstract: (abridged) $R$-modes are oscillations in rotating stars, primarily restored
by the Coriolis force. These oscillations are the most susceptible to the
Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz (CFS) instability driven by gravitational wave
emission, which makes them promising targets for current and future
gravitational wave searches. In order to develop, the instability must overcome
dissipative processes within the star. As a result, $r$-modes become unstable
only for certain combinations of stellar angular velocity $\Omega$ and
(redshifted) temperature $T^\infty$, defining the so-called instability window
on the $(\Omega, T^\infty)$ plane. At high temperatures, bulk viscosity
$\zeta$, arising from out-of-equilibrium chemical reactions, is the dominant
dissipative agent. Dissipation due to $\zeta$ can be greatly enhanced by two
independent mechanisms: (1) the presence of hyperons, which significantly
increases the bulk viscosity, and (2) the distinctive properties of
relativistic $r$-modes in nonbarotropic matter, which further amplify
dissipation beyond Newtonian predictions. In this work, we present the first
investigation of the combined impact of these mechanisms on $r$-mode
instability windows. Our calculations also account for the fact that chemical
reactions modify the adiabatic index, in addition to producing bulk viscosity.
We further estimate the influence of nucleon pairing effects on the instability
windows. By comparing our predictions with recent observations of neutron stars
in low-mass X-ray binaries, we find that bulk viscosity in hyperonic matter may
provide the necessary dissipation to stabilize $r$-modes in the
fastest-spinning and moderately hot stars, even when nucleon superfluidity and
superconductivity are taken into account. These results have important
implications for the interpretation of observations and for the broader
understanding of relativistic $r$-mode physics.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究通过广义相对论磁流体动力学模拟，分析了磁化原中子星（PNS）在四个关键演化阶段的全局性质变化，发现熵和温度的变化增强了磁场对星体变形的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索磁化原中子星在不同演化阶段的物理性质变化，特别是磁场对星体结构和能量分布的影响。

Method: 采用广义相对论磁流体动力学模拟，结合强磁场（约10^17高斯）和基于相对论平均场理论的物态方程（EoS）。

Result: 熵和温度的增加增强了磁场引起的变形，磁通量限制和磁能与结合能比在去轻子化和中微子透明阶段尤为显著。

Conclusion: PNS的演化过程中，核心温度决定了磁场衰减效率，去轻子化和中微子透明阶段的快速耗散最终定义了成熟中子星的观测磁场。

Abstract: This study examines the evolution of the global properties of magnetized
proto-neutron stars (PNSs) across four key stages: neutrino-trapping,
deleptonization, the neutrino-transparent phase, and the formation of a cold,
catalyzed neutron star (NS). We perform general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic simulations with strong magnetic fields of approximately
10^17 Gauss. The stellar matter is modeled using equations of state (EoS)
derived from relativistic mean-field theory, employing density-dependent
couplings calibrated by the DDME2 parameterization. We analyze how the
gravitational mass, equatorial radius, shape deformation, magnetic flux, and
the magnetic-to-binding energy ratio evolve in response to changes in internal
composition, thermodynamic conditions, and magnetic field configuration. Our
results show that as PNSs evolve, increasing entropy per baryon and decreasing
lepton fractions lead to higher core temperatures. These thermodynamic changes
enhance the star's susceptibility to magnetic field-induced deformation,
facilitate greater magnetic flux confinement, and increase the
magnetic-to-binding energy ratio, especially during the deleptonization and
neutrino-transparent phases. The PNS's core temperature also determines the
efficiency of magnetic field decay. We find that dissipation is fastest during
the deleptonization and neutrino-transparent phases, a process that ultimately
defines the observable magnetic field of the mature NS.

TL;DR: 研究了中子星高质量X射线双星在毫米波和射电波段的辐射特性，发现其低频光谱主要由OB超巨星的风自由-自由辐射主导，喷流辐射难以观测。SFXTs在100 GHz比典型SgXBs更暗，可能因其风密度较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中子星高质量X射线双星在红外到硬X射线波段已被广泛研究，但其毫米波和射电特性仍不清楚。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用ALMA和NOEMA观测12个系统（包括SgXBs和SFXTs），并辅以VLA射电观测6个目标。

Result: 9/12目标在毫米波段被检测到，仅2个在射电波段被检测到。光谱指数α=0.6-0.8，表明自由-自由辐射主导。SFXTs在100 GHz比SgXBs更暗。

Conclusion: 低频光谱主要由OB超巨星的风自由-自由辐射主导，喷流辐射难以观测。SFXTs的风密度较低，导致其毫米波辐射较弱。

Abstract: Neutron star high-mass X-ray binaries, where the compact object orbits a
massive star in a sufficiently tight orbit to allow accretion to occur, are
well-studied in wavebands between the infrared and hard X-rays. Their
low-frequency millimeter and radio properties, on the other hand, remain poorly
understood. In this paper, we present the first work in a series focusing on
the millimeter and radio emission of systems where a neutron star accretes from
an OB supergiant. We report ALMA and NOEMA millimeter observations of twelve
systems, supplemented by VLA radio observations of six of those targets. Our
targets include six Supergiant X-ray Binaries (SgXBs), four Supergiant Fast
X-ray Transients (SFXTs), and two intermediate systems. Nine out of twelve
targets, including all SFXTs, are detected in at least one millimeter band,
while in the radio, only two targets are detected. All detected targets display
inverted radio/millimeter spectra, with spectral indices in the range $\alpha
=0.6-0.8$ for those systems where accurate SED fits could be performed. We
conclude, firstly, that the low-frequency SEDs of neutron star SFXTs and SgXBs
are dominated by free-free emission from the OB supergiant's stellar wind, and
that jet emission is unlikely to be observed unless the systems can be detected
at sub-GHz frequencies. Secondly, we find that SFXTs are fainter at 100 GHz
than prototypical SgXBs, probably due to systematically less dense winds in the
former, as supported further by the differences in their fluorescence Fe
K$\alpha$ lines. We furthermore compare the stellar wind constraints obtained
from our millimeter observations with those from IR/optical/UV studies and bow
shock detections, and present evidence for long-term stellar wind variability
visible in the thermal emission.

TL;DR: 论文通过148个偏离轴伽马暴构建了峰值能量与各向同性能量、峰值光度及喷流校准能量的关系，发现这些关系与观测视角有关。校正后的关系更陡峭，且适用于宇宙学距离测量。

Motivation: 研究伽马暴能量关系对观测视角的依赖性，并探索其在宇宙学中的应用。

Method: 利用偏离轴伽马暴数据构建能量关系，并通过喷流模型校正，转换为轴向关系。

Result: 轴向能量关系更陡峭，各向同性能量均值高一个数量级，且轴向哈勃图更适合作为宇宙学指标。

Conclusion: 伽马暴的轴向能量关系更符合同步辐射机制，且对宇宙学研究更具价值。

Abstract: Using 148 out-axis gamma-ray bursts, we build their spectrum-energy relations
of peak energy versus isotropic energy, peak energy versus peak luminosity and
peak energy versus jet-calibrated energy which are corrected for a structured
jet model. These relations are found to depend on the observer's viewing angle
as long as the observer is within the jet cone. After converting the out-axis
energy relations to the in-axis situations, we find that the corresponding
in-axis energy relations are universally steeper, of which all of them can be
roughly interpreted by the Synchrotron radiation mechanism as shown in Xu et
al.. Meanwhile, we notice that the in-axis means of isotropic energies are
about one order of magnitude larger than the out-axis means for both short and
long bursts except the Supernova-associated gamma-ray bursts. Furthermore, we
apply all the newly-found energy relations to construct the Hubble diagrams of
out/in-axis bursts. It is found that the in-axis Hubble diagrams are better
cosmological indicators.

Result: 发现不同GRBs的TeV余辉行为差异，反映了加速粒子最大能量的不同，为物理过程提供诊断。

Conclusion: 强调X射线和GeV-TeV余辉观测对理解GRBs物理过程的重要性，展望未来TeV观测的理论预期。

Abstract: Recent detections of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) at TeV energies opened new
prospects for investigating radiative environments and particle acceleration
mechanisms under extreme conditions. In this paper, we study the afterglows of
these GRBs - namely GRB 180720B, GRB 190114C, GRB 190829A, GRB 201216C, and GRB
221009A - modeling their synchrotron and inverse Compton emission within the
framework of an optimized relativistic fireball model. We constrain the model
parameters and their temporal evolution by applying our theoretical model to
the high-energy emission in the X-ray and GeV-TeV energy bands observed at
intermediate and late times. Our results reveal interesting differences among
the TeV-detected GRBs, potentially reflecting a variety of underlying physical
processes that lead to different maximum energies $E_{\text{max}}= \,
\gamma_{\text{max}}\, m_e \, c^2$ of the accelerated particles responsible for
the GRB high-energy emission. We indeed obtain different behaviors of the late
TeV afterglows that ultimately depend on $\gamma_{\text{max}}$. We discuss how
late afterglow observations - on timescales of hours and days - of X-ray and
GeV-TeV emissions are crucial for providing diagnostics of the physical
processes behind GRBs, and we emphasize the theoretical expectations for future
TeV observations.

Motivation: 解决标准Λ冷暗物质模型中哈勃张力的显著差异（5.7σ），提出一种基于已知基本原理的暗区模型。

Method: 基于热新早期暗能量（Hot NEDE）框架，引入暗SU(N)规范对称性及其破缺至SU(N-1)，产生自相互作用暗辐射，并加入费米子多重态作为稳定的暗物质组分。

Result: 模型与SH0ES测定的H0值以及Planck 2018、Pantheon+和DESI重子声学振荡数据在1.4σ水平上一致，显著缓解了哈勃张力。

Conclusion: 该模型不仅解决了哈勃张力问题，还提供了可验证的额外预测，简化版三参数模型保留了核心特征。

Abstract: We present a microscopic model of the dark sector that resolves the Hubble
tension within standard current datasets based on well-known fundamental
principles, gauge symmetry and spontaneous symmetry breaking. It builds on the
Hot New Early Dark Energy (Hot NEDE) setup, featuring a dark $SU(N)$ gauge
symmetry broken to $SU(N-1)$ in a supercooled phase transition that creates a
thermal bath of self-interacting dark radiation in the epoch between Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis and recombination. Adding a fermion multiplet charged under the
gauge symmetry provides a naturally stable component of dark matter that
interacts with dark radiation. Spontaneous symmetry breaking predicts a
decoupling of this interaction once the dark sector cools down, that we refer
to as dark radiation matter decoupling (DRMD). We find agreement between the
SH${}_0$ES determination of $H_0$ as well as combined Planck 2018, Pantheon+
and DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data at 1.4$\sigma$ level, compared
to a 5.7$\sigma$ tension in the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter model. We also
provide a simplified three-parameter DRMD model encoding the essential
features, while the full model offers additional falsifiable predictions.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了蓝倾斜谱的等曲率涨落在早期宇宙中的生成及其对暖暗物质（WDM）质量限制的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究蓝倾斜谱的等曲率涨落如何与当前宇宙学数据一致，并放宽对WDM质量的限制。

Method: 通过分析Lyman-α、引力透镜和银河系卫星数据，结合N体模拟评估非线性物质功率谱和晕质量函数。

Result: 蓝倾斜谱的等曲率涨落可将WDM质量限制降至600 eV，即使WDM占比高达99%。

Conclusion: 蓝倾斜谱的等曲率涨落为WDM模型提供了更宽松的质量限制，对小尺度结构有重要影响。

Abstract: Isocurvature fluctuations can be generated in various scenarios in the early
Universe. In particular, some specific models predict those with a blue-tilted
spectrum, which is consistent with the constraints from cosmic microwave
background such as Planck, although isocurvature fluctuations with an almost
scale-invariant spectrum are severely constrained. We argue that cold dark
matter (CDM) isocurvature fluctuations with blue-tilted spectrum are not only
consistent with current cosmological data, but also can loosen the bound on the
masses of warm dark matter (WDM), which suppresses small-scale power. In pure
thermal WDM models with the adiabatic initial condition, a combination of the
data from Lyman-$\alpha$, gravitational lensing, and Milky Way satellites gives
a lower bound on the WDM mass as $6~{\rm keV}$ at $95\%$ C.L. while mixed
WDM+CDM models loosen these bounds to $m_{\rm WDM}\sim1$ keV for a
warm-fraction $f_{\rm WDM}\lesssim0.14$ and $m_{\rm WDM}\sim600$ eV for $f_{\rm
WDM}\lesssim0.08$. On the other hand, as we demonstrate, WDM scenarios with a
blue-tilted CDM isocurvature power spectrum, even with only $1\%$ CDM
contribution ($f_{\rm WDM}\sim0.99$), can allow WDM masses as low as $600$ eV.
We further assess the implications of this ``warm + cold-isocurvature''
extension for the small-scale structure by performing $N$-body simulations,
particularly focusing on nonlinear matter power spectrum and halo mass
function.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在仅有约10颗成员星速度数据的情况下，如何提取超暗矮星系暗物质晕的参数，并指出在这种情况下只能可靠提取一个参数（ρ_s r_s）。通过简单缩放关系可复现Jeans模型结果，并以Ursa Major III为例说明其J因子可能被高估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Rubin Observatory等新发现更多矮星系，许多星系初始可能仅有少量成员星数据，因此需要研究如何在这种情况下提取暗物质晕参数。

Method: 假设NFW暗物质分布，通过平衡建模提取参数，并利用半光质量估计器的缩放关系简化分析。

Result: 在仅有少量数据时，只能可靠提取一个参数（ρ_s r_s），且尺度半径通常无法约束。Ursa Major III的J因子可能因异常星体而被高估。

Conclusion: 少量数据下暗物质晕参数提取受限，需谨慎处理异常数据以避免高估J因子。

Abstract: We consider the extraction of parameters of dark matter halos hosting
ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, in the case where there are only ${\cal O}(10)$
identified member stars with measured line-of-sight velocities. This scenario
is likely to be increasingly common, as upcoming newly discovered dwarf
galaxies in the Milky Way, by e.g. the Rubin Observatory, will likely (at least
initially) have only a few identified members. Assuming an NFW dark matter
profile, equilibrium modeling likely can only robustly extract one halo
parameter ($\rho_s r_s$), but the scale radius itself will typically be
unconstrained. In these cases, the results obtainable from Jeans modeling can
be well replicated by a simple scaling relation motivated by the half-light
mass estimator. As a application, we examine the recently discovered stellar
system Ursa Major III, which has been optimistically assessed to have the
largest $J$-factor of any known object. We suggest that, because of the
presence of outlier stars, the $J$-factor obtained from modeling of Ursa Major
III is likely inflated, as it is inconsistent with the half-light mass
estimator, while removal of the outliers will leave the $J$-factor
unconstrained from below.

Result: $R^2$模型与广义相对论差异小，而$R^{1+\epsilon}$模型导致标量扰动指数增长，增强引力波信号。

Conclusion: $R^{1+\epsilon}$模型的独特行为可能使引力波信号被LISA等探测器探测到。

Abstract: Ultra-light primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses $M_\mathrm{PBH}<5\times
10^{8}\mathrm{g}$ can trigger an early matter-dominated (eMD) era before Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and reheat the Universe through their evaporation.
Notably, the initial isocurvature in nature PBH energy density fluctuations can
induce abundantly gravitational waves (GWs) due to second-order gravitational
effects. In this work, we study this induced GW signal within the context of
$f(R)$ gravity theories investigating the effect of $f(R)$ gravity on the
behaviour of scalar perturbations during the PBH-driven eMD era as well as on
the source of the second-order induced tensor modes. In particular, we focus on
two very minimal $f(R)$ models, that is $R^2$ and $R^{1+\epsilon}$, with
$\epsilon\ll 1$, gravity theories as illustrative examples, finding at the end
that $R^2$ gravity presents very small deviations from general relativity (GR)
at the level of both the scalar and tensor perturbations. However,
$R^{1+\epsilon}$ gravity features a different behaviour, exhibiting in
particular an exponential growth of scalar perturbations during a
matter-dominated era. This unique feature leads ultimately to an enhanced
induced GW signal even for very small initial PBH abundances, being
characterized by a linear frequency scaling on large infrared scales away from
the peak frequency, i.e. $\Omega_\mathrm{GW}(k)\propto f$ for $f\ll
f_\mathrm{peak}$, and a spiky behaviour close to the non-linear cut-off scale
below which perturbation theory breaks down. Interestingly, one finds as well
that the induced GW signal can be well within the sensitivity curves of GW
detectors, namely that of LISA, ET, BBO and SKA.

Abstract: We explore the properties of interferometric data from high-redshift 21~cm
measurements using the Murchison Widefield Array. These data contain redshifted
21~cm signal, contamination from continuum foreground sources, and radiometric
noise. The 21~cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization is expected to be
highly-Gaussian, which motivates the use of the power spectrum as an effective
statistical tool for extracting astrophysical information. We find that
foreground contamination introduces non-Gaussianity into the distribution of
measurements, and then use this information to separate Gaussian from
non-Gaussian signal. We present improved upper limits on the 21cm EoR power
spectrum from the MWA using a Gaussian component of the data, based on the
existing analysis from Nunhokee et al (2025). This is extracted as the
best-fitting Gaussian to the measured data. Our best 2 sigma (thermal+sample
variance) limit for 268 hours of data improves from (30.2~mK)^2 to (23.0~mK)^2
at z=6.5 for the EW polarisation, and from (39.2~mK)^2 to (21.7~mK)^2 =
470~mK^2 in NS. The best limits at z=6.8 (z=7.0) improve to P < (25.9~mK)^2 (P
< (32.0~mK)^2), and k = 0.18h/Mpc (k = 0.21h/Mpc). Results are compared with
realistic simulations, which indicate that leakage from foreground
contamination is a source of the non-Gaussian behaviour.

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of clustering of galaxies in an expanding
universe by applying the fluctuation theory. We evaluate the fluctuation
moments for the number of particles and the correlated fluctuations for number
and energy of particles, clustering under their mutual gravitation. The
correlated fluctuations $<\Delta N\Delta U>$ show that the value of $<\Delta
N>$ can be both positive as well as negative, because it is the difference
between $N$ and the mean value of $N$. A negative $<\Delta N>$ corresponds to
regions of under density and positive $<\Delta N>$ corresponds to regions of
over density, as described by the clustering parameter $b$. The present work is
concerned in the region $b\ge 0$, at which gravitational interaction has
already started causing the galaxies to cluster. Thus for this work the value
of $<\Delta N>$ is positive. Similarly, the energy fluctuations $<\Delta U>$
can also be both positive and negative. For large correlations, the overdense
regions typically have negative total energy and underdense regions have
usually positive total energy. The critical value at which this switch occurs
has been calculated analytically. The results obtained by fluctuation theory
closely match with those obtained earlier by Specific heat analysis and Lee
Yang theory. The evaluation has been extended to multicomponent systems, having
a variety of masses. It has been found that the gravitational clustering of
galaxies is more sensitive to mass ratios and less sensitive to galaxies number
densities. This means there is little effect of $\nu$ (number density) but
significant effect of $\mu$ (mass) on the clustering phenomenon. The clustering
of galaxies is quicker when mass of individual galaxies increases. As the mass
of galaxies increases, the transition from positive to negative energy occurs
at a higher stage of clustering as compared to a single component system.

Motivation: 解释JWST观测到的高红移星系的小角直径现象，挑战ΛCDM模型。

Method: 使用宇宙计时器的H(z)数据测试CCC+TL模型，并与ΛCDM模型进行统计比较。

Result: CCC+TL模型无法拟合H(z)数据，且与SN Ia数据存在显著内部矛盾；ΛCDM模型表现更优。

Conclusion: CCC+TL模型在H(z)数据上表现不佳，ΛCDM模型更具优势。

Abstract: Recently, the Covarying Coupling Constants and Tired Light (CCC+TL) hybrid
model was proposed to explain the unexpectedly small angular diameters of
high-redshift galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that
are challenging to reconcile with the $\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we test
the CCC+TL model against model-independent Hubble parameter [$H(z)$]
measurements obtained from cosmic chronometers. It turns out that the parameter
set optimized for the type-Ia supernova (SN Ia) dataset within the CCC+TL model
fails to reproduce the $H(z)$ data, but the $\Lambda$CDM model works well.
Statistical comparison using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) strongly
favors $\Lambda$CDM over CCC+TL for the $H(z)$ data, with $\Delta \mathrm{BIC}
= 60.85$. Additionally, the fit of the CCC+TL model to the $H(z)$ data results
in a best-fit value for the speed-of-light variation index parameter $\alpha$
disagreeing with that for the SN Ia data at the $\sim 6\sigma$ level,
demonstrating significant internal tension within the CCC+TL framework.

Motivation: 验证X射线流量与星系团质量的关系，为高红移星系团提供低成本的质量估计方法。

Method: 使用ACT和MaDCoWS星系团样本，引入修正系数η，分析X射线流量与质量的关系。

Result: 修正系数η≈0.8（ACT-DR5质量）或η≈1.1（弱透镜校准质量），X射线流量可作为质量指标。

Conclusion: X射线流量是高红移星系团质量的低成本有效指标，修正系数η取决于质量定义。

Abstract: We use a subsample of co-detections of the ACT and MaDCoWS cluster catalogs
to verify the predicted relation between the observed X-ray flux $F_X$ in the
0.5-2~keV band and the cluster mass $M_{\rm 500c}$ for halos at $z>0.6-0.7$. We
modify this relation by introducing a correction coefficient $\eta$, which is
supposed to encapsulate factors associated with a particular method of flux
estimation, the sample selection function, the definition of the cluster mass,
etc. We show that the X-ray flux, being the most basic X-ray observable, serves
as a convenient and low-cost mass indicator for distant galaxy clusters with
photometric or even missing redshifts (by setting $z=1$) as long as it is known
that $z\gtrsim 0.6-0.7$. The correction coefficient $\eta$ is $\approx 0.8$ if
$M^{\rm UPP}_{\rm 500c}$ from the ACT-DR5 catalog are used as cluster masses
and $\eta\approx 1.1$ if weak-lensing-calibrated masses $M^{\rm Cal}_{\rm
500c}$ are used instead.

Conclusion: 未来更大数据集的分析可能进一步验证这一结果。

Abstract: We search for dipole variations in the Hubble constant $H_0$ using gamma-ray
burst (GRB) data, as such anisotropies may shed light on the Hubble tension. We
employ the most recent and reliable GRB catalogs from the $E_{p}-E_{iso}$ and
the $L_0-E_{p}-T$ correlations. Despite their large uncertainties, GRBs are
particularly suited for this analysis due to their redshift coverage up to
$z\sim9$, their isotropic sky distribution that minimizes directional bias, and
their strong correlations whose normalizations act as proxies for $H_0$. To
this aim, a whole sky scan - partitioning GRB data into hemispheres - enabled
to define dipole directions by fitting the relevant GRB correlation and
cosmological parameters. The statistical significance across the full $H_0$
dipole maps, one per correlation, is then evaluated through the normalization
differences between hemispheres and compared against the CMB dipole direction.
The method is then validated by simulating directional anisotropies via Markov
Chain Monte Carlo analyses for both correlations. Comparison with previous
literature confirms the robustness of the method, while no significant dipole
evidence is detected, consistently with the expected isotropy of GRBs. This
null result is discussed in light of future analyses involving larger datasets.

Abstract: Dark sector interactions can be explored via the so-called Type 3 model where
dark matter and dark energy exchange momentum only, so as to minimize
deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM background expansion history. Using N-body
simulations, we analyze the imprint of Type 3 model parameters, the momentum
exchange coupling constant $\beta$ and the slope of scalar field potential
$\lambda$, on large-scale structure (LSS) observables, particularly the matter
pairwise velocity statistics. We find that the effects of $\beta$ ($< 0$) and
$\lambda$ on the mean matter peculiar pairwise velocity and velocity dispersion
are degenerate. Our results highlight the potential of velocity statistics as a
probe of dark sector interactions and underscore the importance of
disentangling $\beta$ and $\lambda$ in cosmological analyses.

Conclusion: GSM模型在合理考虑不确定性后，仍是一个解决哈勃张力的可行候选方案。

Abstract: We critically examine recent claims challenging the viability of the G-step
model (GSM) as a solution to the Hubble tension. The GSM proposes a $\sim$4 %
increase in the effective gravitational constant $G_{\text{eff}}$ beyond $z
\approx 0.01$ to reconcile local and early-universe measurements of the Hubble
constant. Through detailed quantitative analysis, we demonstrate that many
proposed constraints on the model require careful reconsideration. Key findings
include: (1) Modern stellar modeling indicates a weaker $L \propto G^4$ scaling
rather than the traditional $G^7$, significantly reducing tension with stellar
evolution constraints; (2) The fluid-like behavior of Earth 150 Myr ago
preserves the day/year ratio across any $G$ transition; (3) Paleoclimate data
showing $\sim$20{\deg}C cooling over relevant timescales appears consistent
with, rather than challenging, the GSM; (4) Distance indicator comparisons
allow for $\Delta G/G$ variations up to $\sim$20 % at 2$\sigma$ when systematic
uncertainties are properly included; (5) The discrete nature of the proposed
$G$ transition preserves relative stellar population ages used in cosmic
chronometry. When accounting for proper uncertainty levels in both observations
and theoretical modeling, we find the GSM remains a viable candidate for
resolving the Hubble tension. We identify specific observational tests with
next-generation facilities that could definitively confirm or rule out the
model.

Result: 逐像素法将$\langle y \\rangle$的上限限制提高了3-5倍，表明其优于频率单极法。

Conclusion: 逐像素法能显著提升未来光谱畸变实验的科学潜力，优化组分分离方法。

Abstract: The sky-averaged Compton-$y$ distortion in the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) energy spectrum, $\langle y \rangle$, provides information about energy
injection in the Universe occurring at $z \lesssim 5\times10^{4}$. It is
primarily sourced by the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect -- the up-scattering
of CMB photons on free electrons in collapsed dark matter halos. In this work
and our companion paper, Ref. [1], we perform a re-analysis of the archival
COBE/FIRAS data to constrain $\langle y \rangle$. We utilize two analysis
approaches: (i) fitting the sky-averaged intensity spectrum (frequency
monopole) and (ii) fitting the sky spectrum in each pixel (pixel-by-pixel). We
obtain the baseline upper limits $\langle y \rangle < 31\times 10^{-6}$ and
$\langle y \rangle < 8.3\times 10^{-6}$ (both at $95\%$ C.L.) for these two
approaches, respectively. We present the first detailed comparison of these
analysis methods on both mock skies and real data. Our findings suggest that
accounting for the spatial variability of foregrounds via pixel-by-pixel
fitting allows for tighter constraints on $\langle y \rangle$ by a factor of
$\approx 3-5$ as compared to the frequency monopole method. We show that our
frequency monopole results agree well with predictions from Fisher forecast
techniques based on the sky-averaged signal, which have been used for
forecasting future spectral distortion experiments. Our results thus suggest
that the scientific reach of future spectral distortion experiments can
potentially be enhanced by a factor of a few via more optimal component
separation methods, and we identify the pixel-by-pixel method as one such
robust way to achieve this. We discuss the implications of our improved
constraints on $\langle y \rangle$ from the pixel-by-pixel method in Ref. [1].

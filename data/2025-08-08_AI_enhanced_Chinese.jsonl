In rare cases the SN\nejecta interact with circumstellar material (CSM) that was ejected from the\nprogenitor system prior to the SN. The unknown distance between the CSM and SN\nexplosion site makes it impossible to predict when the interaction will start.\nIf the time between the SN and start of CSM interaction is of the order of\nmonths to years the SN has generally faded and is not actively followed up\nanymore, making it even more difficult to detect the interaction while it\nhappens. Here we report on a real-time monitoring program which ran between\n13-11-2023 and 09-07-2024, monitoring 6914 SNe Ia for signs of late-time\nrebrightening using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Flagged candidates\nwere rapidly followed up with photometry and spectroscopy to confirm the\nlate-time excess and its position. We report the discovery of a $\\sim50$ day\nrebrightening event in SN 2020qxz around 1200 days after the peak of its light\ncurve. SN 2020qxz had signs of early CSM interaction but faded from view over 2\nyears before its reappearance. Follow-up spectroscopy revealed 4 emission lines\nthat faded shortly after the end of the ZTF detected rebrightening. Our best\nmatch for these emission lines are H$\\beta$ (blue shifted by $\\sim5900$ km\ns$^{-1}$) and CaII$_{\\lambda8542}$, NI$_{\\lambda8567}$, and KI$_{\\lambda\\lambda\n8763, 8767}$, all blue shifted by 5100 km s$^{-1}$ (although we note that these\nidentifications are uncertain). This shows that catching and following up on\nlate-time interactions as they occur can give new clues about the nature of the\nprogenitor systems that produce these SNe by putting constraints on the\npossible type of donor star, and the only way to do this systematically is to\nuse large sky surveys such as ZTF to monitor a large sample of objects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ZTF\u76d1\u6d4b6914\u4e2aIa\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0SN 2020qxz\u5728\u5cf0\u503c\u540e\u7ea61200\u5929\u51fa\u73b0\u7ea650\u5929\u7684\u518d\u4eae\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u665a\u671f\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u524d\u8eab\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "Ia\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7684\u524d\u8eab\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u7206\u70b8\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u4e89\u8bae\uff0c\u665a\u671f\u4e0e\u661f\u9645\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6355\u6349\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528ZTF\u5bf96914\u4e2aIa\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u8ddf\u8fdb\u5019\u9009\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6d4b\u5149\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0SN 2020qxz\u5728\u5cf0\u503c\u540e\u7ea61200\u5929\u51fa\u73b050\u5929\u7684\u518d\u4eae\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5149\u8c31\u663e\u793a4\u6761\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0eH\u03b2\u548cCaII\u3001NI\u3001KI\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u665a\u671f\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ef\u63ed\u793a\u524d\u8eab\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de1\u5929\u9879\u76ee\u5982ZTF\u3002"}}

This scenario also\npredicts a distinct polarization signature for the reflected X-ray continuum,\nwith the polarization vector being perpendicular to the direction towards the\nprimary source and polarization degree (PD) being determined by the scattering\nangle. We report the results of two deep observations of the currently\nbrightest (in reflected emission) molecular complex Sgr A taken with the\nImaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) in 2022 and 2023. We confirm the\nprevious polarization measurement for a large region encompassing Sgr A complex\nwith higher significance, but also reveal an inconsistent polarization pattern\nfor the brightest reflection region in its center. X-ray polarization from this\nregion is almost perpendicular to the expected direction in the case of Sgr A*\nillumination and shows a smaller PD compared to the large region. This could\nindicate the simultaneous propagation of several illumination fronts throughout\nthe CMZ, with the origin of one of them not being Sgr A*. The primary source\ncould be associated with the Arches stellar cluster or a currently unknown\nsource located in the closer vicinity of the illuminated cloud, potentially\nlowering the required luminosity of the primary source.

Resolve enables us to\ndistinguish multiple emission lines from hydrogen-like and helium-like iron\n(Fe) ions. This study focuses on the multi-temperature structure of Abell 2029\nusing line-ratio diagnostics. Using a single-temperature collisionally ionized\nequilibrium model, we measure average plasma temperatures of 6.73 keV, 7.61\nkeV, and 8.14 keV in the central, inner northern, and outer northern regions,\nrespectively, spanning a radial range up to 700 kpc. To further investigate\nthermal structure, we derive excitation and ionization temperatures by\ncomparing observed emission-line flux ratios with atomic database predictions.\nSignificant deviations from the single-temperature CIE model in the central and\ninner northern regions indicate the presence of multi-phase gas. The excitation\nand ionization temperatures range from 2.85 keV to 8.5 keV in the central\nregion, 4.3 keV to 9.8 keV in the inner northern region, and 8.3 keV to 10.4\nkeV in the outer northern region. These temperature distributions are largely\nconsistent with the previously observed temperature gradient of A2029. However,\nResolve detects two notably cooler components--3.42 keV in the central region\nand $\\sim$4.3 keV in the inner northern region--likely associated with\ndisplaced cool gas due to gas sloshing. Additionally, we thermally resolve a\n2.85 keV gas component at the core of A2029--potentially a significant\ndevelopment in our understanding of gas cooling. We propose that this cooler\ngas is a direct product of ongoing cooling processes in A2029, having already\ncooled to its present temperature.

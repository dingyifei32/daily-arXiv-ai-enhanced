### [1] [Electron-neutrino lepton number crossings: variations with the supernova core physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13429)
*Marie Cornelius,Irene Tamborra,Malte Heinlein,Shashank Shalgar,Hans-Thomas Janka*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究了超新星核心坍缩中电子中微子轻子数（ELN）角分布对快速中微子味转换的影响，发现原中子星对流和μ子产生会显著改变ELN交叉的位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解ELN交叉对超新星中快速中微子味转换的影响，并探究其与超新星微观物理和原中子星对流的关系。

Method: 通过12个球对称中微子流体动力学模拟，结合不同微观物理条件和原中子星对流处理，计算中微子角分布并分析ELN交叉。

Result: 原中子星对流使ELN交叉出现在较大半径，而μ子产生则使其出现在较小半径，且这些效应与核状态方程关系不大。

Conclusion: 超新星微观物理、原中子星对流和中微子输运对ELN角分布有微妙但重要的影响。

Abstract: A crucial ingredient affecting fast neutrino flavor conversion in
core-collapse supernovae (SNe) is the shape of the angular distribution of the
electron-neutrino lepton number (ELN). The presence of an ELN crossing signals
favorable conditions for flavor conversion. However, the dependence of ELN
crossings on the SN properties is only partially understood. We investigate a
suite of 12 spherically symmetric neutrino-hydrodynamics simulations of the
core collapse of a SN with a mass of $18.6 M_\odot$; each model employs
different microphysics (i.e., three different nuclear equations of state, with
and without muon creation) and includes or not a mixing-length treatment for
proto-neutron star convection. We solve the Boltzmann equations to compute the
neutrino angular distributions relying on static fluid properties extracted
from each of the SN simulations in our suite for six selected post-bounce
times. We explore the dependence of the ELN distributions on the SN
microphysics and proto-neutron star convection. We find that the latter shifts
the proto-neutron star radius outwards, favoring the appearance of ELN
crossings at larger radii. On the other hand, muon creation causes
proto-neutron star contraction, facilitating the occurrence of ELN crossings at
smaller radii. These effects mildly depend on the nuclear equation of state.
Our findings highlight the subtle impact of the SN microphysics, proto-neutron
star convection, and neutrino transport on the ELN angular distributions.

### [2] [The role of three-dimensional effects on ion injection and acceleration in perpendicular shocks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13436)
*Luca Orusa,Damiano Caprioli,Lorenzo Sironi,Anatoly Spitkovsky*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文通过2D和3D混合模拟研究了非相对论垂直激波中的粒子加速和磁场放大，重点分析了激波漂移加速及其与马赫数的关系，发现3D模拟能更准确地捕捉离子注入过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示宇宙射线起源的关键在于理解非相对论无碰撞激波中粒子加速的条件。

Method: 采用2D和3D混合模拟（动力学离子和流体电子），分析离子注入过程及其对激波马赫数的依赖。

Result: 高效的粒子加速仅在3D模拟中观察到，离子注入依赖于下游磁场湍流的“孔隙度”，且数值分辨率对小尺度湍流的解析至关重要。

Conclusion: 高分辨率3D模拟是准确捕捉垂直激波中粒子加速微观物理机制的必要条件。

Abstract: Understanding the conditions that enable particle acceleration at
non-relativistic collisionless shocks is essential to unveil the origin of
cosmic rays. We employ 2D and 3D hybrid simulations (with kinetic ions and
fluid electrons) to explore particle acceleration and magnetic field
amplification in non-relativistic perpendicular shocks, focusing on the role of
shock drift acceleration and its dependence on the shock Mach number. We
perform an analysis of the ion injection process and demonstrate why efficient
acceleration is only observed in 3D. In particular, we show that ion injection
critically depends on the "porosity" of the magnetic turbulence in the
downstream region near the shock, a property describing how easily the
post-shock region allows particles to traverse it and return upstream without
being trapped. This effect can only be properly captured in 3D. Additionally,
we explore the impact of numerical resolution on ion energization, highlighting
how resolving small-scale turbulence -- on scales below the thermal ion
gyroradius -- is essential for accurately modeling particle injection. Overall,
our results emphasize the necessity of high-resolution 3D simulations to
capture the fundamental microphysics driving particle acceleration at
perpendicular shocks.

### [3] [Variability in Black Hole Accretion: Dependence on Rotational and Magnetic Energy Balance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13441)
*Hyerin Cho,Ramesh Narayan*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究通过调整黑洞吸积盘的初始条件，发现磁场强度和旋转能量的比例是导致间歇性喷流的关键参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨黑洞吸积盘初始条件对喷流稳定性和间歇性的影响。

Method: 修改标准吸积盘设置，包括增大盘尺寸和增强初始磁场，模拟不同黑洞自旋下的吸积过程。

Result: 大动态范围吸积盘未导致强波动，但强磁场引发显著变异性；间歇性喷流与初始旋转和磁能比例相关。

Conclusion: 所有模拟和自然中的热吸积流在足够长时间演化后都会产生间歇性喷流。

Abstract: Most general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black hole (BH)
hot accretion flows are initialized with small rotating tori and produce stable
jets with only small fluctuations. However, recent studies using larger scale
Bondi-like initial conditions have reported intermittent jet activity and loss
of coherent rotation. To investigate the differences, we modify the standard
torus setup across four BH spins: $a_*=0$, $0.5$, $0.9$, $-0.9$. First, we
increase the torus size significantly (pressure maximum at 500 gravitational
radii), allowing long simulations ($2.8\times10^5$ gravitational times) without
gas depletion. These runs reproduce the weak variability seen in smaller tori,
indicating that a larger dynamic range alone does not cause strong
fluctuations. We observe moderate suppression of the accretion rate by factors
of $\sim 1.6, ~2.5$ for BH spins $a_*=0.5,~0.9$, respectively, compared to
$a_*=0$. Also, the density profile scales as $\rho(r)\propto r^{-1.1}$ for
prograde BHs. Next, we considerably strengthen the initial magnetic field in
the large torus by setting the plasma-$\beta\approx 1$. This induces strong
variability in the evolution. The jet efficiency in the $a_*=0.9$ model, for
instance, now varies by over 3 orders of magnitude, and gas rotation reverses
directions. Combining these results with prior studies, we propose that a key
parameter is the ratio $R$ between the rotational and magnetic energies in the
initial state. Strong variability appears later in models with a larger value
of $R$. The implication is that all simulations, and by extension all hot
accretion flows in Nature, will ultimately develop intermittent jets if evolved
long enough.

### [4] [ASKAP J144834-685644: a newly discovered long period radio transient detected from radio to X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13453)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 发现了一个1.5小时周期的长周期射电暂现源ASKAP J144834-685644，其多波段特性表明可能是一个近边缘磁白矮星双星系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索长周期射电暂现源（LPTs）的起源和发射机制，目前样本稀少且性质不明。

Method: 通过多波段观测（X射线到射电）分析ASKAP J144834-685644的光谱能量分布和偏振特性。

Result: ASKAP J144834-685644的射电谱陡峭且偏振，SED峰值在近紫外波段，可能为磁白矮星双星系统。

Conclusion: 部分光学明亮的LPTs可能是吸积双星系统，射电周期为轨道周期，暗示与非吸积同步LPTs（如极星）和非同步白矮星脉冲星（如AR Sco）的潜在联系。

Abstract: Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are an emerging group of radio transients
that show periodic polarised radio bursts with periods varying from a few
minutes to a few hours. Fewer than a dozen LPTs have been detected so far, and
their origin (source and emission mechanism) remains unclear. Here, we report
the discovery of a 1.5 hr LPT, ASKAP J144834-685644, adding to the current
sample of sources. ASKAP J144834-685644 is one of the very few LPTs that has
been detected from X-rays to radio. It shows a steep radio spectrum and
polarised radio bursts, which resemble the radio emission in known LPTs. In
addition, it also shows highly structured and periodic narrow-band radio
emission. Multi-wavelength properties suggest that the spectral energy
distribution (SED) peaks at near ultraviolet wavelengths, indicating the
presence of a hot magnetic source. Combining multi-wavelength information, we
infer that ASKAP J144834-685644 may be a near edge-on magnetic white dwarf
binary (MWD), although we can not fully rule out ASKAP J144834-685644 being an
isolated white dwarf pulsar or even a transitional millisecond pulsar (despite
the lack of radio pulsations). If ASKAP J144834-685644 is an MWD binary, the
observed broadband spectral energy distribution can be explained by emission
from an accretion disk. This hints that some fraction of optically bright LPTs
may be accreting binaries with the radio period being the orbital period. It
might further suggest a connection between optically bright non-accreting
synchronized LPTs, such as polars, and non-accreting asynchronous WD pulsars,
such as AR Sco and J1912-4410.

### [5] [Detection of Low-Redshift Excess in Supernova-Linked Gamma-Ray Bursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13603)
*Qin-Mei Li,Qi-Bin Sun,Sheng-Bang Qian,Fu-Xing Li*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文重新评估了长伽马射线暴（lGRBs）与宇宙恒星形成率（SFR）的关系，发现即使在与超新星直接关联的GRBs中，低红移下的形成率仍高于SFR。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上，lGRBs被用作SFR的示踪物，但最近的观测发现某些lGRBs伴随千新星，表明可能存在双致密星并合的污染，因此需要重新评估其与SFR的关系。

Method: 研究专注于与超新星直接关联的GRBs，构建了光度-红移（L-z）平面，并应用τ统计和Lynden-Bell的C⁻方法校正观测偏差，推导了本征光度函数和形成率。

Result: 分析显示，即使在严格定义的超新星/GRB样本中，低红移（z < 1）下的形成率仍高于SFR。

Conclusion: 低红移下的GRBs可能不适合作为SFR的可靠示踪物，需更大样本进一步研究这一差异。

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are traditionally classified into long (lGRBs) and
short (sGRBs) durations based on their $T_{90}$, with lGRBs widely used as
tracers of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) due to their observed
association with core-collapse supernovae. However, recent detections of
kilonovae accompanying some lGRBs challenge this assumption, suggesting
potential contamination from compact binary mergers. Here, we move beyond the
conventional $T_{90}$-based classification and focus exclusively on GRBs
directly associated with supernovae - the most direct signatures of massive
stellar collapse - to reassess their connection to the SFR. Using a sample of
SN/GRBs, we construct the luminosity - redshift ($L$-$z$) plane and uncover a
significant correlation between these variables. To account for observational
biases, we apply the $\tau$ statistic and Lynden-Bell's $C^{-}$ method to
derive the intrinsic luminosity function and formation rate. Our analysis
reveals that even among this well-defined subsample, the SN/GRB formation rate
still exceeds the SFR at low redshifts ($z < 1$). These findings suggest that
GRBs at low redshift may not serve as reliable tracers of the SFR, and that
larger samples are required to further investigate this discrepancy.

### [6] [The Double-Episode Jet Genesis of the eROSITA and Fermi Bubbles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13665)
*Ruiyu Zhang,Fulai Guo,Shaokun Xie,Ruofei Zhang,Shumin Wang,Guobin Mou*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 通过三维流体动力学模拟，研究认为费米泡和eROSITA泡是由银河系中心两次连续的活动星系核喷流活动产生的，模拟结果与观测数据吻合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 费米泡和eROSITA泡的起源尚不明确，研究旨在通过模拟验证其是否由银河系中心的喷流活动形成。

Method: 采用三维流体动力学模拟，模拟两次喷流活动对气泡形态、X射线表面亮度分布和O viii/O vii线比的影响。

Result: 模拟成功再现了观测到的气泡形态和多波段X射线数据，表明第一次喷流（15 Myr前）形成eROSITA泡，第二次喷流（5 Myr前）形成费米泡。

Conclusion: 研究支持这些结构源自银河系中心的喷流活动，并表明喷流活动是间歇性的。

Abstract: The Fermi and eROSITA bubbles are two pairs of large diffuse multi-band
structures detected in our Milky Way galaxy, yet their origins remain
uncertain. Using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the
model where these bubbles were produced by two successive active galactic
nucleus jet activities from the Galactic center, with their edges delineated by
the correspondingly driven forward shocks. Our simulations successfully
reproduce the observed morphology, multi-band X-ray surface brightness
distributions between 0.11 and 2.04 keV, and O viii/O vii line ratios, matching
ROSAT and eROSITA observations. The results indicate that the first jet pair,
launched 15 Myr ago, created the eROSITA bubbles, now extending to ~15 kpc with
gas temperatures of ~0.25 keV. The second jet pair, launched 5 Myr ago,
produced the Fermi bubbles, currently reaching ~10 kpc with temperatures of
0.3--0.4 keV. The sharp edges of the eROSITA and Fermi bubbles are naturally
explained by the forward shocks in this double-episode jet scenario. Our
findings support a Galactic-scale origin for these structures and suggest
episodic jet activities from the Galactic center.

TL;DR: 论文通过三维广义相对论磁流体动力学模拟，发现了黑洞吸积流中的新型逆行进动，由极向磁场与黑洞旋转对齐产生的磁力矩引起。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究黑洞吸积系统中喷流进动的机制，特别是在强磁化条件下，磁场对吸积流动力学的影响。

Method: 采用大规模三维广义相对论磁流体动力学模拟，研究倾斜吸积流在旋转黑洞周围的动力学行为。

Result: 发现了新型逆行进动，由极向磁场产生的磁力矩与Lense-Thirring力矩相反而引起。

Conclusion: 强磁化吸积流具有独特性质，为观测到的喷流进动提供了新解释。

Abstract: Observations of accreting black hole (BH) systems, such as microquasars and
supermassive black holes, often reveal a precessing jet with changing
directions, indicating a misaligned accretion flow relative to the BH spin. The
precession is commonly attributed to the Lense-Thirring (LT) effect, which
arises from the BH's rotation twisting the surrounding spacetime and accretion
flow. In the strongly magnetized regime, which is preferred accretion flow
conditions for M~87$^*$ and likely other jet-producing systems, the large-scale
magnetic field can significantly influence the flow dynamics. Here, we perform
large-scale three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of tilted accretion onto a rotating BH, and find a
never-seen-before new retrograde precession. This precession arises from a
magnetic torque on the disk generated by the poloidal magnetic field aligned
with the BH's rotation, opposing the LT torque. This finding highlights the
unique property of highly magnetized accretion flows around BHs and provides a
new interpretation of jet precession observed in many systems.

Motivation: 探索紧凑双星合并是否可能产生GeV能段的中微子信号，以验证其作为天体物理中微子源的假设。

Method: 利用LIGO、Virgo和KAGRA第四观测期的合并事件数据，结合IceCube-DeepCore探测器在0.5-5 GeV能段的中微子候选者，在引力波探测时间±500秒窗口内搜索统计显著的信号。

Result: 未观测到统计显著的中微子信号，并设定了这些天体发射中微子的上限。

Conclusion: 紧凑双星合并目前未显示出作为GeV能段中微子源的显著证据，未来需进一步研究。

Abstract: Compact binary mergers, detected in gravitational waves since 2015, are
candidate sources for astrophysical neutrinos in the GeV regime from
proton-proton and proton-neutron collisions. This contribution presents the
results of the search for such a signal using mergers detected during the
fourth observing run of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA interferometers. We use the
dense infill array at the center of the IceCube detector, IceCube-DeepCore, to
select neutrino candidates in the 0.5-5 GeV energy range. The search for a
statistically significant excess associated with an astrophysical signal is
performed in a $\pm$ 500 s window around the gravitational wave detection time.
We do not observe any statistically significant excess in the neutrino data,
and set upper limits on the neutrino emission from these objects. Additionally,
we search for subpopulations of neutrino-emitting sources, including merger
events detected in previous observing runs; no significant signal has been
identified yet.

Abstract: Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows and kilonovae (KNe) are electromagnetic
transients that can accompany binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. Therefore,
studying their emission processes is of general interest for constraining
cosmological parameters or the behavior of ultra-dense matter. One common
method to analyze electromagnetic data from BNS mergers is to sample a Bayesian
posterior over the parameters of a physical model for the transient. However,
sampling the posterior is computationally costly, and because of the many
likelihood evaluations needed in this process, detailed models are too
expensive to be used directly in inference. In the present article, we address
this problem by introducing fiesta, a python package to train machine learning
(ML) surrogates for GRB afterglow and kilonova models that can accelerate
likelihood evaluations. Specifically, we introduce extensive ML surrogates for
the state-of-the-art GRB afterglow models afterglowpy and pyblastafterglow, as
well as a new surrogate for the KN emission as modeled by the possis code. Our
surrogates enable evaluation of the lightcurve posterior within minutes. We
also provide built-in posterior sampling capabilities in fiesta that rely on
the flowMC package which scale efficiently to higher dimensions when adding up
to tens of nuisance sampling parameters. Because of its use of the JAX
framework, fiesta also allows for GPU acceleration during both surrogate
training and posterior sampling. We apply our framework to reanalyze
AT2017gfo/GRB170817A and GRB211211A using our surrogates, thus employing the
new pyblastafterglow model for the first time in Bayesian inference.

Abstract: The study of fast variability properties in X-ray binaries advances our
understanding of the physical processes and geometric properties of the
accretion flow around the compact object. In this work, we study the evolution
of the timing properties of Cygnus X-1 with AstroSat/LAXPC, during the
transition of the source from the hard to soft state in 2017. We use a novel
frequency-segmented technique to fit simultaneously the cross spectra and part
of the power spectra and coherence function with a multi-Lorentzian model and
predict the phase-lags and the complementary parts of the power spectra and
coherence function. We study the evolution of the frequency and power of the
main variability components that are present throughout all the states. In
particular, we identify previously undetected variability components, one of
which manifests as a narrow dip in the coherence function and a broad drop in
the phase-lag spectrum at the same frequency. This dip in coherence, which we
detected for the first time in Cygnus X-1 at energies above 3 keV, appears in a
state in which the source shows high-amplitude radio variability and
significant hard X-ray polarization. While the contribution of the compact jet
in X-rays is debated in the literature, this study provides a new avenue for
investigating jet properties as well as the geometry of the Comptonizing
medium.

Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are spun up during their accretion phase in a
binary system. The exchange of angular momentum between the accretion disk and
the star tends to align the spin and orbital angular momenta on a very short
time scale compared to the accretion stage. In this work, we study a subset of
$\gamma$-ray MSPs in binaries for which the orbital inclination $i$ has been
accurately constrained thanks to the Shapiro delay measurements. Our goal is to
constrain the observer viewing angle $\zeta$ and to check whether it agrees
with the orbital inclination $i$, thus $\zeta \approx i$. We use a Bayesian
inference technique to fit the MSP $\gamma$-ray light-curves based on the third
$\gamma$-ray pulsar catalogue (3PC). The emission model relies on the striped
wind model deduced from force-free neutron star magnetosphere simulations. We
found good agreement between those two angles ($i$ and $\zeta$) for a
significant fraction of our sample, between 1/2 and 2/3, confirming the
spin-orbit alignment scenario during the accretion stage. However about one
third of our sample deviates significantly from this alignment. The reasons are
manifold: either the $\gamma$-ray fit is not reliable or some precession and
external torque avoid an almost perfect alignment.

Abstract: We present a study on the detection and characterization of transient
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the $\gamma$-ray emission of blazars 4C
+31.03, MG1 J123931+0443, and PKS 1622$-$253. Using light curves derived from
\textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope data, we investigate oscillatory patterns
characterized by periodic multiplicative amplitudes that vary linearly over
time. By segmenting the light curves into increasing and decreasing trends, we
analyze each segment independently, allowing for precise measurements of both
the periodicity and long-term variations. To interpret these QPOs, we explore
various theoretical scenarios that could explain their origin and underlying
physical mechanisms. The estimated periods for blazars MG1 J123931+0443 and PKS
1622$-$253 are consistent with precessional dynamics expected in binary
supermassive black hole systems, although our current results do not allow for
a definitive conclusion.

Conclusion: 奇异子的概念为理解强相互作用致密物质提供了新视角，奇异子星和奇异块的存在有待进一步观测验证。

Abstract: The fact that strange sea quarks are abundant in the nucleons, but without
strangeness, is of great importance for understanding the nature of dense
matter condensed by the strong interaction, particularly in the context of the
``gigantic nucleus'' formed by the gravitational collapse of an evolved massive
star. We hypothesize that the basic unit of bulk strong matter with the
light-flavor symmetry of valence quarks is ``strangeon'', which is the
counterpart of the nucleon found in atomic nuclei. In addition to strangeon
stars (SnSs) with large baryon number of $A\approx 10^{57}$, strange nuggets
(SnNs) with $A\gtrsim 10^{10}$ could also exist in the Universe. Both the SnS
and the SnN are explained, with attention to their observational evidence.

Conclusion: 质子加速在磁重联层中起关键作用，能自洽解释GeV辐射，模型对质子含量范围具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Magnetic reconnection in current layers that form intermittently in
radiatively inefficient accretion flows onto black holes is a promising
mechanism for particle acceleration and high-energy emission. It has been
recently proposed that such layers, arising during flux eruption events, can
power the rapid TeV flares observed from the core of M87. In this scenario,
inverse Compton scattering of soft radiation from the accretion flow by
energetic electron-positron pairs produced near the reconnection layer was
suggested as the primary emission mechanism. However, detailed calculations
show that radiation from pairs alone cannot account for the GeV emission
detected by the Fermi observatory. In this work, we combine analytic estimates
with 3D radiative particle-in-cell simulations of pair-proton plasmas to show
that the GeV emission can be naturally explained by synchrotron radiation from
protons accelerated in the current sheet. Although the exact proton content of
the layer is uncertain, our model remains robust across a broad range of
proton-to-pair number density ratios. While protons are subdominant in number
compared to pairs, our simulations demonstrate that they can be accelerated
more efficiently, leading to a self-regulated steady state in which protons
dominate the energy budget. Ultimately, proton synchrotron emission accounts
for approximately 5% to 20% of the total dissipation power. The majority is
radiated as MeV photons via pair synchrotron emission, with a smaller fraction
emitted as TeV photons through inverse Compton scattering.

Motivation: 研究GRBs的极端值分布，以验证是否所有观测数据来自单一事件群体，而不依赖特定模型假设。

Method: 从CGRO-BATSE和Fermi-GBM仪器观测的GRB目录中提取通量、峰值通量和持续时间，使用GEV形式化方法建模极端值分布。

Result: 极端值分布与单一事件群体一致，但GRB221009A的通量和峰值通量是显著例外，其观测概率极低。

Conclusion: GRB221009A可能是罕见的宇宙学GRB事件，其通量和峰值通量的观测概率分别为每千年和每世纪一次。

Abstract: Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are known to be unpredictable in time and position. A
few (observationally) exceptional events have been observed, as GRB221009A that
stands out for its fluence and peak flux, being orders of magnitude higher than
what measured so far. Analyzing the observed fluence, peak flux or duration
distributions typically requires one to assume some scenarios, and the
consistency of the observed data with the predictions turns out to be an
important model diagnostic. However, it is also of interest to model these
distributions using general statistical properties that do not rely on specific
model assumptions, allowing one to derive inferences only based on the
consistency of the observed distributions with the hypothesis of one single
population of events that generate them. We obtained fluences, peak fluxes and
durations from the catalogues of GRBs observed by the CGRO-BATSE and Fermi-GBM
instruments. We selected the extreme values in slots of equal duration and
modelled their distributions by the generalized extreme value (GEV) formalism.
The GEV distribution is a limit distribution naturally arising when the number
of observations is large and is essentially independent of the phenomena
producing the observed data. The distributions of extreme values for fluences,
peak fluxes and durations are consistent with being extracted from a single
population of events but the fluence and peak flux recorded for GRB221009A
constitutes a striking exception. The probability to observe such an event,
assuming it is a cosmological GRB, is low, with a median value of about one
event per millennium for the fluence and about one event per century for the
peak flux.

Abstract: We present the first independent re-analysis of the galaxy clustering data
from DESI Data Release 1, utilizing an effective field theory (EFT)-based
full-shape model. We analyze the power spectra and bispectra of the public
catalogs using a custom-built pipeline based on window-deconvolved
quasi-optimal estimators, carefully accounting for all relevant systematic
effects. Compared to the official collaboration analysis, we add the galaxy
power spectrum hexadecapole and the bispectrum monopole, and also introduce a
novel stochastic estimator for fiber collisions, which facilitates robust
bispectrum analyses. As a first application, we perform an EFT-based full-shape
analysis of the DESI power spectra and bispectra in the context of the standard
cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Using external priors on the physical baryon
density and the primordial power spectrum tilt, we constrain the matter density
fraction to $\Omega_m=0.284\pm 0.011$, the Hubble constant to $h=0.707\pm
0.011$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude to $\sigma_8=0.811\pm 0.030$. The
bispectrum has a noticeable effect on parameter estimation: it sharpens the
constraints on $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$ by $\approx 10$\% and shifts
$\Omega_m$ by $\approx 1\sigma$ towards the Planck $\Lambda$CDM value.
Combining our full-shape likelihood with the official DESI DR2 BAO
measurements, cosmological parameters shift further towards the \textit{Planck}
values, with $\Omega_m=0.296\pm 0.007$, $h=0.688\pm 0.006$, $\sigma_8=0.818\pm
0.029$ (with tighter constraints obtained in joint analyses). Finally, the
galaxy bispectrum data dramatically improves measurements of quadratic bias
parameters, which are consistent with predictions from halo occupation
distribution models. Our work highlights the importance of higher-order
statistics and sets the stage for upcoming full-shape analyses of non-minimal
cosmological models.

Abstract: We measure the distribution of matter contained within the emptiest regions
of the Universe: cosmic voids. We use the large overlap between the Ultraviolet
Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS) and voids identified in the LOWZ
and CMASS catalogues of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) to
constrain the excess surface mass density of voids using weak lensing. We
present and validate a novel method for computing the Gaussian component of the
conventional weak lensing covariance, adapted for use with void studies. We
detect the stacked weak lensing void density profile at the $6.2\sigma$ level,
the most significant detection of void lensing from
spectroscopically-identified voids to date. We find that large and small voids
have different matter density profiles, as expected from numerical studies of
void profiles. This difference is significant at the $2.3\sigma$ level.
Comparing the void profile to a measurement of the void-galaxy
cross-correlation to test the linearity of the relationship between mass and
light, we find good visual agreement between the two, and a galaxy bias factor
of $2.45\pm0.36$, consistent with other works. This work represents a promising
detection of the lensing effect from underdensities, with the goal of promoting
its development into a competitive cosmological probe.

Abstract: We characterize the post-inflationary evolution of the equation of state of
the universe from the end of inflation until the onset of radiation domination,
when the inflaton is coupled to a daughter field through a trilinear
interaction. We consider an inflaton potential that is quadratic near the
minimum and flattens in the inflationary regime. By simulating the dynamics in
2+1-dimensional lattices, we have tracked the long-term evolution of the
equation of state for about ten e-folds of expansion, for various coupling
strengths. The trilinear interaction initially excites daughter field modes
through a process of tachyonic resonance immediately after inflation and
triggers a temporary deviation of the equation of state from $\bar{w} = 0$ to a
maximum value $\bar{w} = \bar{w}_{\rm max} < 1/3$. However, at much later
times, the inflaton homogeneous mode once again dominates the energy density,
pushing the equation of state towards $\bar{w} = 0$ until the onset of
perturbative reheating. By combining the lattice results with a Boltzmann
approach, we characterize the entire post-inflationary expansion history, which
allows to calculate precise predictions for the inflationary CMB observables.
We also accurately compute the redshift of the stochastic gravitational wave
background produced during preheating, and show that taking the temporary
return of the equation of state towards $\bar{w} = 0$ into account can reduce
the amplitude by many orders of magnitude relative to previous estimates.

Conclusion: 当前方法对普朗克尺度暗物质不敏感，但为带电粒子探测提供了潜在途径。

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of detecting galactic orbit dark matter
passing through Earth by measuring its gravitational coupling with a wire under
tension. We do so by exploring the transverse and longitudinal waves induced on
the wire to detect a massive particle passing within $\sim 1$ m of the wire.
The particle's $r^{-2}$ interaction with the wire provides an initial momentum
which develops into a propagating wave carrying a distinctive time dependent
displacement. Most interestingly, we find that both transverse and longitudinal
waves develop with unique profiles, allowing for a full, three dimensional
reconstruction of the particle's trajectory and its mass over velocity ratio.
We find that, at interaction distances of 0.1 to 100 mm with a 90 micron
diameter copper beryllium wire, Planck scale dark matter with mass $\sim
10^{19}$ GeV/$c^2$ would create immeasurable displacements on the scale of
$10^{-24}$ to $10^{-26}$ m. In order to create displacements detectable by
modern, commercially available, displacement sensors on the nanometer scale we
require dark matter with a particle mass greater than $4 \times 10^7$ kg ($\sim
2 \times 10^{32}$ GeV/$c^2$). This is outside the upper limit of the Planck
scale by 13 orders of magnitude and would also have such a low particle flux
that a detection event would be implausible. Finally, we perform a similar
analysis for a charged wire and an elementary charged particle with their
electrostatic interaction, finding that a sufficiently slow charged particle
would produce a transverse displacement comparable to the sensitivity of
currently available sensors.

Abstract: One of the most fundamental relationships in modern cosmology is the cosmic
distance duality relation (CDDR), which describes the relationship between the
angular diameter distance ($D_{\rm A}$) and the luminosity distance ($D_{\rm
L}$), and is expressed as: $\eta(z)=D_{\rm L}(z)(1+z)^{-2}/D_{\rm A}(z)=1$. In
this work, we conduct a comprehensive test of the CDDR by combining baryon
acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the SDSS and DESI surveys with type Ia
supernova (SN) data from PantheonPlus and DESY5. We utilize an artificial
neural network approach to match the SN and BAO data at the same redshift. To
explore potential violations of the CDDR, we consider three different
parameterizations: (i) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0z$; (ii) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0z/(1+z)$;
(iii) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0\ln(1+z)$. Our results indicate that the calibration of
the SN absolute magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ plays a crucial role in testing potential
deviations from the CDDR, as there exists a significant negative correlation
between $\eta_0$ and $M_{\rm B}$. For PantheonPlus analysis, when $M_{\rm B}$
is treated as a free parameter, no evidence of CDDR violation is found. In
contrast, fixing $M_{\rm B}$ to the $M_{\rm B}^{\rm D20}$ prior with
$-19.230\pm0.040$ mag leads to a deviation at approximately the $2\sigma$
level, while fixing $M_{\rm B}$ to the $M_{\rm B}^{\rm B23}$ prior with
$-19.396\pm0.016$ mag remains in agreement with the CDDR. Furthermore, overall
analyses based on the SDSS+DESY5 and DESI+DESY5 data consistently show no
evidence of the deviation from the CDDR.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the possibility of generating an inflationary
mechanism within the framework of a metric-$f(R)$ modified gravity theory,
formulated in the Jordan frame. We explore whether the scalar field,
non-minimally coupled to gravity and emerging in the Jordan frame, can play the
role of the primordial inflaton. Particular attention is devoted to
constructing a dynamical scenario in the Jordan frame that exhibits a
slow-rolling phase for the scalar field and admits a quasi-de Sitter solution
for cosmic evolution. To ensure consistency with the standard cosmological
model, we impose a matching condition with the $\Lambda$CDM model at the end of
the inflationary phase. Furthermore, to address the problem of the absence of
matter after inflation, we consider a radiation-type particle creation process
that maintains an approximately constant energy density. We test our
theoretical model against background observational data, specifically Pantheon+
calibrated with SH0ES and DESI calibrated with BBN. We asses its viability and
discuss implications for alleviating the Hubble constant tension.

Abstract: We systematically extend the framework of galaxy bias renormalization to
two-loop order. For the minimal complete basis of 29 deterministic bias
operators up to fifth order in the density field and at leading order in
gradient expansion we explicitly work out one- and two-loop renormalization.
The latter is provided in terms of double-hard limits of bias kernels, which we
find to depend on only one function of the ratio of the loop momenta. After
including stochasticity in terms of composite operator renormalization, we
apply the framework to the two-loop power spectrum of biased tracers and
provide a simple result suitable for numerical evaluation. In addition, we work
out one- and two-loop renormalization group equations (RGE) for deterministic
bias coefficients related to bias operators constructed from a smoothed density
field, generalizing previous works. We identify a linear combination of bias
operators with enhanced UV sensitivity, related to a positive eigenvalue of the
RGE. Finally, we present an analogy with the RGE as used in quantum field
theory, suggesting that a resummation of large logarithms as employed in the
latter may also yield useful applications in the study of large-scale galaxy
bias.

Abstract: Exotic dark matter (EDM) refers to a dark matter species whose equation of
state deviates from zero at late times. This behavior enables it to model a
variety of non-standard late-time cosmologies, offering alternatives to various
dark energy (DE) models, especially when the DE sector violates the null energy
condition. In this work, by fitting to CMB, BAO, and Supernovae (SNe) data and
comparing models in a Bayesian approach, we show that simple models of exotic
dark matter are statistically comparable to the $w_0w_a$CDM DE model in
explaining the recent anomaly in the late-time cosmological evolution suggested
by DESI and supernova observations, although in both classes of models the
evidence against the $\Lambda$CDM model only appears when the DES-Y5 or Union3
SNe dataset is included. The value of $H_0$ remains similar to that in the DE
model, except in the no-SNe case, where the DE model predicts lower values than
$\Lambda$CDM, thereby worsening the Hubble tension, whereas the EDM models
yield values closer to that of $\Lambda$CDM, albeit with larger uncertainty. In
addition, the EDM models predict a drastically different energy budget for the
present-day universe compared to the standard model, and provide an explanation
for a coincident problem in the DE-model explanation of the DESI anomaly.

Abstract: Recent observations of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark
Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, when combined with measurements
of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), provide
compelling evidence for a phantom crossing at late times, along with
statistically significant deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In
this work, we investigate the role of redshift-space galaxy clustering data by
employing the pre-reconstruction full-shape (FS) galaxy power spectrum from the
Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) data release 12 (DR12) sample.
This dataset is analyzed in combination with BAO measurements from DESI data
release 2 (DR2) and various SNIa samples. Our analysis demonstrates that the
joint combination of these datasets can yield deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at a
significance level of up to $\sim 5\sigma$, suggesting strong indications that
the dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$ may have crossed the phantom
divide ($w = -1$) in the redshift range $z \sim 0.4$--$0.5$. The precise
location and strength of this crossing depend on the adopted theoretical
parameterizations. Importantly, our results reveal that this trend persists
even in the absence of CMB data, underscoring the robustness of the FS power
spectrum as a powerful and independent probe for testing dark energy models and
for distinguishing between competing cosmological scenarios.

Abstract: We analyze two different scenarios for the late Universe dynamics, resulting
into Hubble parameters deviating from the $\Lambda$CDM, mainly for the presence
of an additional free parameter, which is the dark energy parameter. The first
model consists of a pure evolutionary dark energy paradigm, as result of its
creation by the gravitational field of the expanding Universe. The second model
also considers an interaction of the evolutionary dark energy with the matter
component, postulated via the conservation of the sum of their ideal
energy-momentum tensors. These two models are then compared \textit{via} the
diagnostic tool of the effective running Hubble constant, with the binned data
of the so-called ``Master sample'' for the Type Ia Supernovae. The comparison
procedures, based on a standard MCMC analysis, led to a clear preference of
data for the dark energy - matter interaction model, which is associated to a
phantom matter equation of state parameter (very close to $-1$) when, being
left free by data (it has a flat posterior), it is fixed in order to reproduce
the decreasing power-law behavior of the effective running Hubble constant,
already discussed in literature.

Abstract: Cosmic voids have emerged as powerful probes for cosmology, providing
complementary information on the large-scale structure of the universe. We
present the first application of a hydrodynamical framework to model the
evolution of cosmic voids. This approach offers a physically intuitive
characterization of void dynamics and can naturally be applied to non-standard
cosmologies. We derive the cosmology-dependent mapping that relates the linear
(Lagrangian) and fully non-linear (Eulerian) evolution of the matter density
contrast, a central component for accurate theoretical modeling of void
statistics. Furthermore, we present a new method for determining the
shell-crossing epoch across arbitrary cosmological backgrounds, thereby
extending previous treatments restricted to the Einstein-de Sitter universe.
  Motivated by recent DESI results hinting at dynamical dark energy, we
investigate void evolution in $ w_0w_a$CDM cosmologies by varying $ w_0$ and
$w_a$. We also consider the impact of varying the matter density parameter, $
\Omega_{\mathrm{m},0}$. We find that the evolution of isolated, spherically
symmetric cosmic voids is most sensitive to $ \Omega_{\mathrm{m},0} $ and $ w_0
$, which can alter the non-linear density contrast by up to 20-30%. Variations
in $w_a$ have a smaller impact, but may still lead to measurable effects. We
also show that the cosmology-dependent mapping between linear and non-linear
density contrasts may provide a sensitive probe of dynamical dark energy in
precision void analyses.

Abstract: We present new constraints on the halo masses and matter density profiles of
DESI galaxy groups by cross-correlating samples of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs)
and Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) galaxies with the publicly available CMB lensing
convergence map from ACT DR6. This provides an independent, lensing-based
calibration of halo masses, complementary to methods relying on clustering or
dynamics. We derive constraints on the mean halo mass for three DESI-selected
samples, finding $\log(M_{\rm halo}/(M_\odot/h)) \approx 13.18$, 13.03 and
13.02 for the Main LRG, Extended LRG, and BGS samples, respectively. Using a
halo model approach, we also compare the projected galaxy-matter density
profiles with previously reported gas profiles inferred from measurements of
the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. This work addresses one of the
key uncertainties in interpreting kSZ signals -- the unknown host halo mass
distribution -- by providing an independent and consistent mass calibration.
The agreement between the gas and total mass profiles at large aperture
suggests that sufficiently far from the group center (2--3 virial radii), we
recover all the baryons, offering a resolution to the 'missing baryon' problem.
We further study the cumulative gas fractions for all galaxies as well as for
the most massive galaxy groups in the sample ($\log(M_{\rm halo}/(M_\odot/h))
\approx 13.5$), finding values that are physically sensible and in agreement
with previous findings using kSZ and X-ray data: compared to the TNG300
simulation, the observed gas fractions are systematically lower at fixed radius
by $\gtrsim$4$\sigma$, providing compelling, independent evidence for stronger
baryonic feedback in the real Universe. These findings highlight the power of
combining CMB lensing with galaxy surveys to probe the interplay between
baryons and dark matter in group-sized halos.

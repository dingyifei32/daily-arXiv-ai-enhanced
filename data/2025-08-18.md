### [1] [Breaking the Strings: the signatures of Cosmic String Loop Fragmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11596)
*Pierre Auclair*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 研究了宇宙弦环数量密度中碎片化的影响，提出了一种新方法并展示了数值结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨碎片化对宇宙弦环数量密度的影响，为模型校准提供关键依据。

Method: 基于三尺度模型和玻尔兹曼方程，提出了两种互补的数值方法。

Result: 碎片化导致大尺度上环数量密度衰减，并偏离纯幂律分布。

Conclusion: 碎片化对环分布模型的校准至关重要。

Abstract: We study the impact of fragmentation on the cosmic string loop number
density, using an approach inspired by the three-scale model and a Boltzmann
equation. We build a new formulation designed to be more amenable to numerical
resolution and present two complementary numerical methods to obtain the full
loop distribution including the effect of fragmentation and gravitational
radiation. We show that fragmentation generically predicts a decay of the loop
number density on large scales and a deviation from a pure power-law. We expect
fragmentation to be crucial for the calibration of loop distribution models.

### [2] [Bulk viscous cosmological models with cosmological constant: Observational constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11614)
*R. Noemí Villalobos,Yerko Vásquez,Norman Cruz,Carlos H. López-Caraballo*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 研究了粘性冷暗物质（vCDM）在Λ主导的FLRW宇宙中是否能缓解哈勃张力，同时满足热力学约束。结果表明哈勃张力部分缓解，但未完全解决，且ΛCDM模型仍更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨vCDM是否能通过粘性缓解哈勃张力，并验证其热力学可行性。

Method: 使用贝叶斯推断，结合Pantheon+ SN Ia、H(z)测量和SH0ES先验数据，分析不同粘性演化模型（常数和变量粘性）。

Result: 哈勃张力部分缓解（约1σ），但ΛCDM模型仍更优。粘性参数ζ0约10^6 Pa s，符合热力学要求。

Conclusion: vCDM模型虽部分缓解哈勃张力，但未超越ΛCDM。未来需结合CMB观测以进一步约束参数。

Abstract: We investigate whether viscous cold dark matter (vCDM) in a
$\Lambda$-dominated FLRW universe can alleviate the Hubble tension while
satisfying thermodynamic constraints, examining both flat and curved
geometries. We model vCDM with bulk viscosity $\zeta =
\zeta_0\,(\Omega_{vc}/\Omega_{vc0})^m$, where $m$ determines the viscosity
evolution and $\Omega_{vc}$ is the density parameter of vCDM. We explore two
particular scenarios: constant viscosity ($m=0$), and variable viscosity ($m$
free). Using Bayesian inference, we constrain these models with the latest
datasets: the Pantheon+ SN Ia sample (both with SH0ES calibration, PPS, and
without it, PP), $H(z)$ measurements from CC and BAO as separate datasets, and
a Gaussian prior on $H_0$ from 2022 SH0ES baseline, $H_0=73.04 \pm 1.04$
km/s/Mpc (R22 prior). We compare the models via information criteria such as
AIC, BIC, DIC, and Bayesian evidence. Our results reveal that the Hubble
tension persists, although it shows partial alleviation ($\sim 1\sigma$
tension) in all investigated scenarios when local measurements are included.
For the flat $m=0$ case, the joint analysis yields $H_0 =
71.05^{+0.62}_{-0.60}$ km/s/Mpc. Curved model initially favors $\Omega_{K0} >
0$ (at more than $2\sigma$), but this preference shifts toward flatness once
the PPS+R22 prior are included. Notably, the current viscosity is constrained
to $\zeta_0 \sim 10^6$ Pa s in all scenarios, in agreement with the
thermodynamic requirements. Although model selection via BIC and Bayesian
evidence favors $\Lambda$CDM, AIC and DIC show mild support for viscous models
in some datasets. Bulk viscous models moderately improve fits but neither
resolve the Hubble tension nor outperform the $\Lambda$CDM model. To achieve
more robust constraints, future analyses should incorporate CMB observations,
which are expected to break parameter degeneracies involving $m$ and
$\tilde{\zeta}_0$.

### [3] [Towards high-precision inspiral gravitational waveforms from binary neutron star mergers in numerical relativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10981)
*Kenta Kiuchi*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文报告了一种四阶精度有限体积HLLC黎曼求解器在自适应网格细化数值相对论代码SACRA-MPI中的性能表现，验证了其在平滑流和强激波问题中的有效性，并量化了双中子星合并引力波波形的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进现有二阶精度黎曼求解器在平滑流和强激波问题中的性能，提升数值模拟的精度和鲁棒性。

Method: 在SACRA-MPI中实现四阶精度有限体积HLLC黎曼求解器，并通过一维特殊相对论流体力学测试和双中子星合并模拟验证其性能。

Result: 四阶求解器在平滑流中实现了四阶收敛，强激波问题中表现鲁棒；在双中子星合并模拟中，相位误差显著低于二阶求解器。

Conclusion: 四阶精度黎曼求解器显著提升了数值模拟的精度和鲁棒性，尤其在引力波相位误差方面表现优异。

Abstract: We report the performance of a newly implemented fourth-order accurate
finite-volume HLLC Riemann solver in the adaptive-mesh-refinement numerical
relativity code {\tt SACRA-MPI}. First, we validate our implementation in
one-dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamics tests, i.e., a simple wave
and shock tube test, which have analytic solutions. We demonstrate that the
fourth-order convergence is achieved for the smooth flow, which cannot be
achieved in our original second-order accurate finite-volume Riemann solver. We
also show that our new solver is robust for the strong shock wave emergence
problem. Second, we validate the implementation in a dynamical spacetime by
demonstrating that {\tt SACRA-MPI} perfectly preserves the $\pi$-symmetry
without imposing the $\pi$-symmetry in a short-term ($\sim 20~{\rm ms}$ in the
inspiral and subsequent post-merger phase) non-spinning equal-mass binary
neutron star merger simulations. Finally, we quantify the accuracy of $\approx
28$ cycles inspiral gravitational waveforms from binary neutron star mergers by
conducting a resolution study with $\approx 78, 94$, $118$, and $135$ m. We
find that the fourth-order accurate Riemann solver achieves the convergence
order $\approx 2.1\pm{0.05}$--$2.4\pm{0.27}$, i.e., slightly evolving with
time, in the inspiral gravitational wave phase, while the second-order accurate
Riemann solver achieves the convergence order $\approx 2.0\pm{0.5}$. The
residual phase error towards the continuum limit at the merger is $0.27\pm
0.07$ rad and $0.58\pm 0.22$ rad out of a total phase of $\approx 176$ rad,
respectively, for the fourth- and second-order accurate Riemann solver.

### [4] [White dwarf-neutron star binaries: a plausible pathway for long-duration gamma-ray bursts from compact object mergers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10984)
*A. A. Chrimes,N. Gaspari,A. J. Levan,M. M. Briel,J. J. Eldridge,B. P. Gompertz,G. Nelemans,A. E. Nugent,J. C. Rastinejad,W. G. J. van Zeist*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文探讨了白矮星-中子星（WDNS）和白矮星-黑洞（WDBH）合并是否可能是长时伽马射线暴（GRB）的解释，通过模拟宿主星系和预测合并率，发现WDNS合并与观测数据一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新评估长时GRB的来源，探索WDNS和WDBH合并是否可能是其成因。

Method: 模拟GRB宿主星系，使用二元种群合成预测合并偏移和速率，并与观测数据对比。

Result: WDNS合并的偏移与观测一致，其合并率与中子星合并和长GRB相似，WDBH合并则更罕见。

Conclusion: WDNS合并是长GRB的合理解释，但仅凭偏移和速率无法区分不同模型。

Abstract: Two long-duration gamma-ray bursts were recently discovered with kilonovae,
the signature of r-process element production in a compact binary merger,
rather than supernovae. This has forced a re-evaluation of the long-established
dichotomy between short bursts (< 2s, arising from compact binary mergers) and
long bursts (> 2s, a class of massive star core-collapse event). We aim to
determine whether white dwarf-neutron star (WDNS) and white dwarf-black hole
(WDBH) mergers are plausible explanations for long-duration compact merger
GRBs, in terms of their galactocentric merger offsets and cosmological rates.
We model the host galaxies of GRBs 211211A and 230307A, and employ binary
population synthesis, to predict the offset distributions of compact mergers.
We compare with the observed offsets, investigate evolutionary pathways,
predict their cosmological rates, and compare with volumetric GRB rates. We
find that WDNS mergers occur at lower host offsets than binary NS mergers, but
that in the specific cases of GRBs 211211A and 230307A, the observed offsets
are consistent with either scenario. We predict that WDNS mergers occur at a
similar rate to binary NS mergers and long GRBs, and that WDBH mergers are a
factor of ten rarer, with the caveat that these rates currently carry
uncertainties at the order of magnitude level. We have demonstrated, solely in
terms of galactocentric offsets and event rates, that WDNS mergers are a
plausible explanation for GRBs 211211A and 230307A, and long GRBs from compact
object mergers more generally. WDNS binaries have lower systemic velocities
than binary neutron stars, but longer delay times, and ultimately merge with an
offset distribution that is not measurably different without large samples.
Therefore, offsets and rates alone cannot currently distinguish between compact
binary progenitor models for supernova-less long duration GRBs.

### [5] [Supernova Rates and Luminosity Functions from ASAS-SN II: 2014-2017 core-collapse supernovae and their subtypes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10985)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文利用ASAS-SN数据估算了核心坍缩超新星（ccSN）及其亚型的体积率和光度函数，结果与以往研究一致，并分析了其与宿主星系质量的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解恒星形成的宇宙历史及ccSN产物的积累。

Method: 使用ASAS-SN在2014-2017年V波段观测的174个ccSN数据，通过注入恢复模拟修正观测完整性。

Result: ccSN总体体积率为7.0×10⁻⁵ yr⁻¹ Mpc⁻³ h₇₀³，亚型比例分别为II型63.2%、剥离包层32.3%、相互作用4.4%。

Conclusion: ccSN率随光度增加而下降，低质量星系中ccSN率显著更高。

Abstract: The volumetric rates and luminosity functions (LFs) of core-collapse
supernovae (ccSN) and their subtypes are important for understanding the cosmic
history of star formation and the buildup of ccSN products. To estimate these
rates, we use data of nearby ccSNe discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey
for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) from 2014--2017, when all observations were made in
the $V$-band. The sample is composed of 174 discovered or recovered events,
with high spectroscopic completeness from followup observations. This allows us
to obtain a statistically precise and systematically robust estimate of nearby
rates for ccSNe and their subtypes. The volumetric rates are estimated by
correcting the observed number of events for the survey completeness, which was
estimated through injection recovery simulations using ccSN light curves. We
find a total volumetric rate for ccSNe of $7.0^{+1.0}_{-0.9} \times 10^{-5} \
\textrm{yr}^{-1} \ \textrm{Mpc}^{-3} \ h^{3}_{70}$, at a median redshift of
0.0149, for absolute magnitudes at peak $M_{V,peak} \leq -14$ mag. This result
is in agreement with previous local volumetric rates. We obtain volumetric
rates for the different ccSN subtypes (II, IIn, IIb, Ib, Ic, Ibn, and Ic-BL),
and find that the relative fractions of Type II, stripped-envelope, and
interacting ccSNe are $63.2\%$, $32.3\%$, and $4.4\%$, respectively. We also
estimate a volumetric rate for superluminous SNe of $1.5^{+4.4}_{-1.1} \
\textrm{yr}^{-1} \ \textrm{Gpc}^{-3} \ h^{3}_{70}$, corresponding to a fraction
of $0.002\%$ of the total ccSN rate. We produce intrinsic $V$-band LFs of ccSNe
and their subtypes, and show that ccSN rates steadily decline for increasing
luminosities. We further investigate the specific ccSN rate as a function of
their host galaxy stellar mass, and find that the rate decreases with
increasing stellar mass, with significantly higher rates at lower mass
galaxies.

### [6] [The Type II SN 2025pht in NGC 1637: A Red Supergiant with Carbon-rich Circumstellar Dust as the First JWST Detection of a Supernova Progenitor Star](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10994)
*Charles D. Kilpatrick,Aswin Suresh,Kyle W. Davis,Maria R. Drout,Ryan J. Foley,Alexander Gagliano,Wynn V. Jacobson-Galan,Ravjit Kaur,Kirsty Taggart,Jason Vazquez*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文分析了超新星SN 2025pht的成像和光谱数据，确认其为II型超新星，并首次通过JWST探测到其前身星，揭示了碳富集尘埃环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究SN 2025pht的前身星及其周围环境，以了解II型超新星前身星的性质和尘埃组成。

Method: 利用HST和JWST的多波段成像数据，结合光谱分析，拟合红超巨星的光谱能量分布。

Result: 发现SN 2025pht的前身星为红超巨星，周围存在碳富集尘埃，光学消光Av=5.3星等。

Conclusion: 研究为II型超新星前身星的性质提供了新见解，并展示了JWST在超新星前身星探测中的潜力。

Abstract: We present follow-up imaging and spectroscopy and pre-explosion imaging of
supernova (SN) 2025pht located in NGC 1637 at 12 Mpc. Our spectroscopy shows
that SN 2025pht is a Type II SN with broad lines of hydrogen and with minimal
line-of-sight extinction inferred from Na I D absorption. NGC 1637 was the
target of several epochs of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST) imaging covering the site of SN 2025pht from 31 to 0.7 yr
prior to discovery. Using a follow-up HST image of SN 2025pht aligned to these
data, we demonstrate that there is a credible progenitor candidate detected in
multiple epochs of HST imaging and in JWST imaging from 1.3-8.7 microns, the
first JWST counterpart to a SN and the longest wavelength detection of a SN
progenitor star. Fitting this source to red supergiant (RSG) spectral-energy
distributions (SEDs), we show that it is consistent with a log(L/Lsun) = 5.0
RSG heavily reddened by circumstellar dust. The JWST photometry enable strong
constraints on the nature of the circumstellar medium, and we find that the SED
favors graphite-rich dust and an optical circumstellar extinction of Av = 5.3
mag as opposed to silicate-rich dust. We discuss the implications of a pre-SN
RSG enshrouded in carbon-rich dust and this finding for the overall population
of progenitor stars to Type II SN as well as the future of SN progenitor star
discovery with JWST.

### [7] [Pulsations change the structures of massive stars before they explode: interpreting the nearby supernova SN 2023ixf](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11088)
*Eva Laplace,Vincent A. Bronner,Fabian R. N. Schneider,Philipp Podsiadlowski*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文研究了红超巨星（RSG）在爆炸前的流体动力学不稳定性和径向脉动，表明脉动显著影响超新星（SN）的前后观测特性，并挑战了传统静态平衡模型的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超新星模型通常假设RSG处于静态平衡状态，但实际观测表明RSG在爆炸前会经历流体动力学不稳定性和脉动，这促使研究者重新评估模型。

Method: 通过自洽地模拟不同质量RSG的流体动力学演化和径向包层脉动，研究脉动对超新星前后特性的影响。

Result: 脉动导致超新星光变曲线的早期超额发射和光球速度演化的变化，且脉动幅度随初始质量增加。研究还发现SN 2023ixf的观测数据与脉动RSG模型吻合良好。

Conclusion: 流体动力学前超新星恒星模型对研究超新星至关重要，需重新理解大质量恒星演化的最后阶段及其与超新星的关联。

Abstract: It is known that massive red supergiants (RSGs) become hydrodynamically
unstable and experience radial pulsations before they explode. Still, the vast
majority of supernova (SN) models assume RSG progenitors in hydrostatic
equilibrium. Here, we self-consistently follow the hydrodynamic evolution of
RSGs with different masses and the development of radial envelope pulsations.
Pulsations significantly alter the observable pre- and post-SN properties, and
their importance increases substantially as a function of initial mass. We
demonstrate that it is not advisable to infer core masses, let alone initial
masses, from a single pre-SN luminosity and effective temperature of high-mass
RSGs, as these quantities can vary by an order of magnitude during the
pulsation. For all masses considered, we find that pulsations can naturally
lead to "early-excess" emission in SN light-curves and to variations in the
early photospheric velocity evolution compared to hydrostatic models that can
help break the degeneracies in type-II SNe. We compare to SN 2023ixf, for which
a pulsating RSG progenitor was discovered. We demonstrate that its pre- and
post-SN characteristics agree very well with our exploding pulsating RSG model,
while hydrostatic stellar models are not well-suited. The data coverage at
early times is insufficient to break all the degeneracies in the progenitor and
SN parameters, but we find some constraints on the explosion phase. We show
that there is no evidence for the claimed pulsation period of the SN 2024ggi
progenitor, as it is consistent with the orbital period of Spitzer. This study
emphasizes the importance of hydrodynamical pre-SN stellar models for studying
SNe and implies an important shift in our understanding of the last stages of
massive star evolution, the interpretation of pre-SN properties, the connection
between SNe and their progenitors, and the missing RSG problem.

Conclusion: 抛射物与吸积盘的相互作用显著影响爆炸的中期演化和后续循环，为理解新星和超新星爆炸提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Many nova and type Ia supernova explosion scenarios involve accretion disks.
However, direct numerical simulations of these explosive phenomena have barely
addressed the question of the impact of ejecta-disk collision on the midterm
evolution of such explosions. This is particularly critical for a better
understanding of classical and recurrent novae, where each nova cycle depends
on the imprint left by the precedent explosion. In this work, we describe and
analyze a set of high-resolution simulations of the ejecta-disk interaction. We
show that, depending on the initial configuration of the binary system, the
disk is partially or, more often, totally destroyed, which will impact the next
nova-explosion cycle. In the case of type Ia supernovae, the much larger
kinetic energy carried by the ejecta always provokes complete destruction of
the accretion disk. We also discuss the alterations induced in the geometry of
the ejecta by the shielding effect of the disk, which has shown to cause
reduced contamination of the companion star up to a factor \sim 1.5 - 2 in key
nuclei produced during the nova outburst. In the framework of recurrent nova
simulations, we report for the first time on the formation of a cavity in the
ejecta after its interaction with the disk. We also describe the onset and
development of several hydrodynamic instabilities such as Kelvin-Helmholtz and
Richtmyer-Meshkov.

Motivation: 探讨高能宇宙射线的质量组成及其对能量谱测量的影响。

Method: 结合现代强子相互作用模型，分析多组数据。

Result: 发现高能宇宙射线质量组成非质子主导，可能需重新评估能量谱。

Conclusion: 重新评估能量谱可能使不同观测结果更一致。

Abstract: A review of several analyses is presented that forces the conclusion that the
mass composition of the highest-energy cosmic rays is not proton-dominated.
This deduction, combined with the use of a modern hadronic interaction model,
should lead to a re-evaluation of the energy spectrum reported by the Telescope
Collaboration that may well bring that measurement, and the corresponding one
from the Pierre Auger Observatory, into better agreement.

Conclusion: 结合分析优化了Pythia 8的模拟性能，为宇宙线研究提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: We present a combined analysis of the Pythia 8 event generator using
accelerator data and evaluate its impact on air shower observables. Reliable
simulations with event generators are essential for particle physics analyses,
achievable through advanced tuning to experimental data. Pythia 8 has emerged
as a promising high-energy interaction model for cosmic ray air shower
simulations, offering well-documented parameter settings and a user-friendly
interface to enable automatic tuning efforts. Using data from collider and
fixed-target experiments, we first derive tunes for each domain separately,
before tuning both domains simultaneously. To achieve this, we define a core
set of observables and quantify their dependence on selected parameters. The
tuning efforts are based on gradient descent and Bayesian methods, the latter
providing a full uncertainty propagation of the parameters to the observables.
Results for the impact of a combined analysis for the Pythia 8/Angantyr event
generator on air shower observables, such as particle densities at ground level
and energy deposit profiles, are presented.

Method: 采用蒙特卡洛模拟研究由注入电子引发的级联过程，分析级联光谱和电子对分布。

Result: 级联效应主导了RICS原始光谱，产生了复杂的偏振信号，同步辐射光谱偏振度高达40%-80%，且比RICS光谱更软。

Conclusion: 级联效应和偏振信号可能解释了IXPE观测到的磁星光谱高偏振现象。

Abstract: Resonant inverse Compton scattering (RICS) of soft thermal photons by
relativistic particles on closed magnetic field loops has been proposed to
explain the hard emission observed up to, and beyond, 200 keV from magnetars.
If particles injected at the base of the loops have Lorentz factors >= 10^2,
the RICS spectra will be attenuated by both one-photon pair production and
photon splitting in the ultra-strong magnetar fields, producing additional
spectral components from pair synchrotron radiation and split photons that
produce further generations of pairs and split photons. We investigate such
cascades initiated by the primary injected electrons through a Monte Carlo
simulation and study the cascade spectra and pair distributions. For most
observer angles, the pair synchrotron and split photon spectra dominate the
RICS primary spectra and produce complex polarization signals. In particular,
the synchrotron spectra are highly polarized with degree 40% - 80%, are softer
than the RICS spectra and may account for the high polarization of some
magnetar spectra observed by IXPE above 3 keV.

hydrogen-rich, superluminous supernova with persistent (at least $\sim100$
days) narrow Balmer lines (SLSN-IIn) at redshift $z=0.1557$. We observed
SN\,2021aaev to rise in $32.5 \pm 1.0$ days since first light and reach a peak
absolute magnitude of $-21.46 \pm 0.01$ in the ATLAS $o$ band. The pre-peak
spectra resemble those of typical SNe IIn with flash-ionization features
arising from the interaction with a dense, confined circumstellar medium (CSM),
albeit the flash timescale is longer than usual ($>20$ days). Post peak, the
narrow emission lines evolve slowly, and the absence of ejecta features
indicates strong deceleration by the CSM. The total radiated energy (about
$1.41\times10^{51}$~ergs) is possible with a low-mass (1--$2\,M_{\odot}$)
ejecta ploughing into a massive (9--$19\,M_{\odot}$), extended (outer radius
$>1\times10^{16}$~cm) H-rich CSM, or alternatively, with magnetar-powered
models. Interestingly, the host environment consists of a spiral galaxy with a
red substructure in the south-eastern part, and the SN's exact location
coincided with the quiescent red substructure (star-formation
rate$=0.02^{+0.13}_{-0.02}\,M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$). Given the atypical
environment and the obscuring effect of the massive CSM, a thermonuclear (Type
Ia-CSM) origin cannot be ruled out. Altogether, SN\,2021aaev is a compelling
case to study the diversity of SLSN-IIn features and their host environment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TDE中喷流与超大质量黑洞（SMBH）自转轴的预进动可能导致观测到的喷流行为复杂化，需研究其在包层中的传播机制。

Method: 采用“零伯努利吸积”（ZEBRA）包层模型，分析喷流在不同预进动角度和包层结构下的传播行为。

Result: 喷流在特定角度（如包层极方向）可自由逃逸，形成间歇性喷流；其他角度下喷流可能被包层阻挡。

Conclusion: 喷流的观测特性取决于其预进动角度与包层结构的匹配程度，为TDE中喷流行为的解释提供了新视角。

Abstract: It is likely that the disk of a tidal disruption event (TDE) is misaligned
with respect to the equatorial plane of the spinning supermassive black hole
(SMBH), since the initial stellar orbit before disruption is most likely has an
inclined orbital plane. Such misaligned disk undergoes Lense-Thirring
precession around the SMBH spin axis, leading to a precessing jet if launched
in the vicinity of the SMBH and aligned with the disk angular momentum. The
bound debris can also build a thick envelope which powers optical emission. In
this work, we study the propagation of the precessing jet in the TDE envelope.
We adopt a ``zero-Bernoulli accretion'' (ZEBRA) envelope model. A episodic jet
will be observed if the line of sight is just at the envelope pole direction
and $\theta_{\rm LT}=\theta_{\rm env}$, since the jet can freely escape from
this low density rotation funnel, where $\theta_{\rm LT}$ and $\theta_{\rm
env}$ are the jet precessing angle and the angle between the envelope polar
axis and the SMBH spin axis, respectively. The jet will be choked at other
directions. For $\theta_{\rm LT} < \theta_{\rm env}$, the jets can also break
out of the envelope for very small precession angle $\theta_{\rm LT}$ or if the
jet is aligned with SMBH spin. If the jet is choked within the envelope, the
radiation produced during cocoon shock breakout will imprint characteris

Abstract: In spider pulsar systems, a relativistic intrabinary shock forms when the
pulsar wind collides with the massive outflow driven off the pulsar's low-mass
stellar companion. The shock is a site of non-thermal particle acceleration,
likely via shock-driven magnetic reconnection, and produces synchrotron
emission. These shocks are among the few systems in which global scales can be
reasonably captured with kinetic simulations, enabling first-principles
particle acceleration and emission studies. We perform the first global 3D
kinetic simulations of spider pulsar intrabinary shocks and predict their
polarized emission properties. We report emission spectra, light curves, and
polarization patterns as a function of the stripe-averaged magnetic field,
cooling strength, and viewing inclination. At $90^\circ$ inclination and for a
low stripe-averaged magnetic field, we reproduce the double peaked light curve
observed in spider systems. We predict a significant polarization degree
$\gtrsim15\%$, which monotonically increases with the stripe-averaged field
strength. Our results can be applied to and tested by forthcoming X-ray
polarization observations of spider pulsars.

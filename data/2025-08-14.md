### [1] [Probing ALP-photon couplings in Neutron Stars: scalar versus pseudoscalar cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09141)

Abstract: We investigate the distribution of an interacting axion-like massive field
within a magnetized Neutron Star. For this we consider the effect of an intense
density-dependent axially symmetric stellar magnetic field ${\bf B}(r,\theta)$
adding another much weaker, but non-vanishing, electric field. We particularize
the latter for the case when a finite chiral charge density is present. The
axion field is thus coupled to a generic function $Q(F_0,G_0)$ depending on
Lorentz invariants $F_0, G_0$ which can be constructed from these
electromagnetic fields. From this, the static axion field equations are solved
as function of stellar radial coordinate and angular direction, $a(r,\theta)$,
using a prescribed linear form for $Q$. In addition, we use a semi-analytical
approach to calculate the stellar structure in this hybrid system where
pressure components are treated under a perturbative scheme, provided induced
deformations with respect to spherical symmetry are tiny. Our results show that
the axion couplings to magnetic and electric fields along with its mass,
critically determine the axion spatial distribution. Furthermore, we focus on
the possibility that the axion field might accumulate in specific outer regions
of the star, particularly within the crust, where it could form a condensate.
We explore the possible presence of magnetic flux tubes from superconductor
phases in this outer layers and qualitatively show they may enhance local
conversion into photons. We explore prospects of detectability through indirect
methods.

### [2] [Numerical modelling of the lobes of radio galaxies VI. Polarimetric simulations of universal pressure profile cluster atmospheres](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09282)

Motivation: 研究目的是通过数值模拟理解星系团大气中喷流的极化特性，并与现有观测数据（如VLA和LOFAR）对比，验证模型的准确性。

Method: 采用相对论磁流体动力学模拟，基于UPP和温度剖面生成RM图，通过RM合成技术分析极化数据，并与直接模拟结果对比。

Result: 成功模拟了极化增强现象和复杂喷流形态的可探测性，验证了RM合成技术的局限性，并提供了当前和未来高分辨率极化研究的参考。

Conclusion: 基于UPP的模拟是目前最接近现实的球对称大气模型，为未来AGN外流极化研究提供了重要依据。

Abstract: We present the results of a polarization study based upon relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic modelling of jets running into hydrostatic, spherically
symmetric cluster atmospheres. For the first time in a numerical simulation, we
derive Faraday rotation measure maps (RM maps) from model cluster atmospheres
based upon the universal pressure profile (UPP), incorporating a temperature
profile for a 'typical' self-similar atmosphere described by only one
parameter: M500. We compare our simulated polarization products with current
observational data from Very Large Array (VLA) and LOw Frequency ARay (LOFAR),
as well as continuing investigations from our previous work, such as the
detectability of the Laing Garrington effect. We also studied the variation of
mean fractional polarization with cluster mass and jet power. We produce
simulated Stokes Q and U channel images and using the Rotation Measure (RM)
synthesis technique we create RM maps. These data provide insight into what we
should expect of current and future high-resolution polarimetric studies of
active galactic nucleus (AGN) outflows as we were able to probe the limitations
of the RM synthesis technique by comparing it with the RM map direct from our
simulations. Highlights of our study include clear reproduction of polarization
enhancements towards the edges of radio lobes for suitable conditions and a
demonstration that complex lobe morphologies with multiple emission and Faraday
active regions interspersed as might be expected in some pole-on or perhaps
precessing sources should be distinguishable in observations with current
technology. Given that the UPP is our most representative general cluster
atmosphere, these numerical simulations, and the polarimetric properties
derived from them, represent the most realistic yet for spherically symmetric
atmospheres.

### [3] [Optical polarization properties of the closest tidal disruption event AT 2023clx indicate origin from tidal stream shocks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09309)
*Karri I. I. Koljonen,Kari Nilsson,Ioannis Liodakis,Elina Lindfors*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文通过光学偏振观测研究了潮汐瓦解事件AT 2023clx，发现其偏振度和偏振角的变化规律与AT 2020mot相似，支持潮汐流冲击驱动光学爆发的模型。


<details>

Motivation: 潮汐瓦解事件的偏振观测为超大质量黑洞周围的吸积过程提供了独特视角。

Method: 使用北欧光学望远镜对AT 2023clx进行光学偏振观测。

Result: 观测到偏振度在光变曲线峰值后上升并衰减，最大偏振度约5%，偏振角在6至20天内变化60°-100°。

Conclusion: 偏振变化支持潮汐流冲击驱动光学爆发的模型，表明这些事件中吸积盘形成机制可能相同。

Abstract: Polarization observations of tidal disruption events offer unique insights
into the accretion processes around supermassive black holes. Here, we present
optical polarization observations of the nearby event AT 2023clx, obtained
using the Nordic Optical Telescope. Our observations reveal a rise and
subsequent decay in the polarization degree, temporally offset from the peak of
the optical light curve, reaching maximum intrinsic polarization degree of
$\sim$5 per cent. In addition, the polarization angle shifts by
$\sim60^\circ-100^\circ$ between 6 to 20 days after the optical peak, remaining
stable thereafter. Remarkably, the observed polarization variability closely
resembles that of AT 2020mot, strongly suggesting a common mechanism for
accretion disk formation in these events. The variability in both polarization
degree and angle supports models in which tidal stream shocks drive the optical
outburst during the accretion disk formation.

### [4] [Impact of thermal effects on prompt-collapse binary neutron star mergers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09333)
*Carolyn A. Raithel,Vasileios Paschalidis*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究了中子星合并后残余物的命运，重点关注有限温度核物质状态方程（EoS）对直接坍缩阈值质量的影响，发现其影响较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨有限温度EoS的不确定性对中子星合并后直接坍缩阈值质量的影响，以补充此前主要关注零温度EoS的研究。

Method: 使用两种冷EoS结合四种有限温度EoS参数化，分析其对阈值质量的影响。

Result: 阈值质量对有限温度EoS的变化不敏感（亚百分比精度），但热压力在超核密度下可达冷压力的1-10%，影响喷射物和残余盘质量。

Conclusion: 有限温度EoS对直接坍缩阈值质量影响有限，但对合并后的热力学性质和喷射物有轻微影响。

Abstract: The fate of the remnant following the merger of two neutron stars initially
on quasicircular orbits depends primarily on the mass of the initial neutron
stars, the mass ratio, and the still-uncertain dense-matter equation of state
(EoS). Previous works studying the threshold mass for prompt collapse to a
black hole have primarily focused on the uncertainties in the zero-temperature
EoS, which are parametrized by a macroscopic quantity such as the
characteristic neutron star radius. However, prompt collapse can take place
either with or without a core bounce during the merger. In the bounce-collapse
scenario, shocks can produce additional thermal support, potentially altering
the threshold for collapse. In this work, we investigate the impact of the
uncertainties in the finite-temperature part of the nuclear EoS on the
threshold mass for prompt collapse in equal mass mergers. Using two cold EoSs,
combined with four parametrizations of the finite-temperature part of the EoS,
we find that the threshold mass is insensitive to realistic variations of the
thermal prescription, at sub-percent accuracy. We report on the thermal
properties and ejecta of mergers with masses just above the threshold mass,
i.e., which experience a single core-bounce before collapsing. During the
bounce, the thermal pressure can reach )(1-10)% of the cold pressure at
supranuclear densities, depending on the thermal treatment, leading to modest
differences in the dynamical ejecta that are launched and in the remnant disk
mass as a result.

### [5] [Complex Ionization and Velocity Structures in GX 340+0 X-ray Binary Revealed by XRISM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09359)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文首次利用高分辨率XRISM光谱分析了中子星低质量X射线双星GX 340+0，揭示了其发射和吸收特征的复杂细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究中子星低质量X射线双星的发射和吸收特征，以理解其多电离和多速度结构。

Method: 使用Cloudy光谱合成代码建模发射和吸收特征，并结合relxillNS模型分析相对论反射特征。

Result: 发现了多电离和多速度结构，包括宽窄线成分、静止和蓝移特征，以及2735 km/s的吸积盘风。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了GX 340+0的复杂光谱特征，为理解中子星吸积盘物理提供了新见解。

Abstract: We present the first high-resolution XRISM spectrum of the neutron star
low-mass X-ray binary GX 340+0, revealing unprecedented detail in its emission
and absorption features. The spectrum reveals a rich and complex Fe XXV
He$\alpha$ line profile and a P-Cygni profile from Ca XX. We use the
state-of-the-art spectral synthesis code Cloudy to model the emission and
absorption features in detail. Our analysis reveals multi-ionization and
multi-velocity structures, where the combination of broad ($\sim$ 800 km/s) and
narrow ($\sim$ 360 km/s) line components, along with rest-frame and blueshifted
emission and absorption lines, accounts for the observed line profile
complexity. We identify a modest $\sim$ 2735 km/s accretion disk wind
exhibiting both absorption and emission features. We also detect a relativistic
reflection feature in the spectrum, which we model using relxillNS -
specifically designed to characterize X-ray reprocessing in accretion disks
around neutron stars. Furthermore, we examine the detailed physics of the Fe
XXV He$\alpha$ complex, focusing on the forbidden-to-resonance line ratio under
the influence of continuum pumping and optical depth effects.

### [6] [AT2022sxl: A Candidate Repeating Tidal Disruption Event in Possible Association with Two High-Energy Neutrino Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09408)
*Shunhao Ji,Zhongxiang Wang,Litao Zhu,Stefan Geier,Alok C. Gupta*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文报告了一个候选重复潮汐撕裂事件（TDE）AT2022sxl，发现于大视场光学巡天数据中，观测到两次光学峰值间隔约7.2年，并伴随延迟约200天的中红外（MIR）耀发。光谱分析表明宿主星系可能是复合星系，TDE事件可能为H+He型，并产生Hα、Hβ和He I λ5876的宽发射线。此外，IceCube中微子观测站检测到的两次中微子事件与该TDE在位置和时间上匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究重复TDE事件及其与中微子事件的关联，探讨MIR辐射在中微子产生中的作用。

Method: 通过光学巡天数据发现候选TDE，分析光学和中红外耀发，结合光谱数据确定宿主星系和TDE类型，并与中微子事件进行时空匹配。

Result: 发现AT2022sxl为候选重复TDE，宿主星系为复合星系，TDE事件可能为H+He型，且与两次中微子事件在时空上匹配。

Conclusion: MIR辐射可能是TDE中产生中微子的必要条件，为理解TDE与高能天体物理现象的关联提供了新线索。

Abstract: We report a candidate repeating tidal disruption event (TDE), AT2022sxl,
found from large-field optical survey data. Two flares with a separation time
of $\sim$7.2\,yr between the two optical peaks are observed. Related
mid-infrared (MIR) flares, with delay times of $\sim$200\,day are also seen. We
analyze two optical spectra of the TDE source, onenear the optical peak of the
second flare from the Transient Name Server and one at the quiescent flux level
after the second flare. The latter was taken by us with the 10.4-m Gran
Telescopio Canarias. Comparing the features of the two spectra, we identify
that the host is likely a composite galaxy at redshift 0.23 and the TDE event,
probably an H+He type, mainly powered broad components in the emission lines of
H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, and He~I $\lambda$5876. More interestingly, we find that
two Bronze-type neutrino events, detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory,
match the TDE in position and the second flare, especially the delayed MIR
flare, in time. We discuss the MIR luminosity properties of the currently
reported (candidate) neutrino-emitting TDEs and suggest that luminous MIR
emission is a prerequisite for neutrino production in TDEs.

### [7] [New Metrics for Identifying Variables and Transients in Large Astronomical Surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09441)
*Shih Ching Fu,Arash Bahramian,Aloke Phatak,James C. A. Miller-Jones,Suman Rakshit,Alexander Andersson,Robert Fender,Patrick A. Woudt*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于高斯过程回归的方法，用于分析天文光变曲线，解决了数据稀疏和不规则采样等问题，并在ThunderKAT数据集中验证了其优于传统方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型天文巡天项目需要识别变源和暂现源，但光变曲线的统计表征因数据质量问题和多样性而具有挑战性。

Result: 在6394个射电光变曲线上验证，该方法比传统指标ην和Vν具有更好的区分能力和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为初步筛选工具，适用于其他巡天项目，并提供了Python和R的计算工具。

Abstract: A key science goal of large sky surveys such as those conducted by the Vera
C. Rubin Observatory and precursors to the Square Kilometre Array is the
identification of variable and transient objects. One approach is the
statistical analysis of the time series of the changing brightness of sources,
that is, their light curves. However, finding adequate statistical
representations of light curves is challenging because of data quality issues
such as sparsity of observations, irregular sampling, and other nuisance
factors inherent in astronomical data collection. The wide diversity of objects
that a large-scale survey will observe also means that making parametric
assumptions about the shape of light curves is problematic. We present a
Gaussian process (GP) regression approach for characterising light curve
variability that addresses these challenges. Our approach makes no assumptions
about the shape of a light curve and, therefore, is general enough to detect a
range of variable source types. In particular, we propose using the joint
distribution of GP amplitude hyperparameters to distinguish variable and
transient candidates from nominally stable ones and apply this approach to 6394
radio light curves from the ThunderKAT survey. We compare our results with two
variability metrics commonly used in radio astronomy, namely $\eta_\nu$ and
$V_\nu$, and show that our approach has better discriminatory power and
interpretability. Finally, we conduct a rudimentary search for transient
sources in the ThunderKAT dataset to demonstrate how our approach might be used
as an initial screening tool. Computational notebooks in Python and R are
available to help facilitate the deployment of this framework to other surveys.

### [8] [Linear Polarization in a Black Hole, 4U~1957+115 and its X-ray Spectral Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09692)
*Lev Titarchuk,Elena Seifina,Paolo Soffiitta,Diana Makhinya*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的光谱偏振方法，用于通过黑洞源的线性偏振值估计X射线双星的倾角，基于Sunyaev & Titarchuk (1985)的理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用IXPE等任务的光谱偏振观测数据，结合光谱分析，验证该方法在黑洞源（如4U 1957+115）中的应用。

Method: 通过多任务数据（IXPE、NuSTAR等）分析X射线光谱，使用Comptonization模型拟合，确定光学深度、光子指数和等离子体温度。

Result: 发现光子指数随质量吸积率单调增加，最终在高吸积率时饱和于Γ∼3，并通过标度法确定了黑洞质量。

Conclusion: 该方法结合光谱偏振和光谱分析，为黑洞源的倾角和质量估计提供了新途径。

Abstract: We present a new spectro-polarimetric method for estimation of the
inclination of X-ray binaries using the linear polarization (LP) value in black
hole (BH) sources, based on the early paper by Sunyaev \& Titarchuk (1985,
ST85). The X-ray LP arises from multiple scattering of initially soft photons
in a hot, optically thick Compton cloud (CC) using a flat geometry. ST85 showed
that the LP degree $P$ depends on the binary inclination $i$ and remains
independent of the photon energy. Moreover, the $P$ follows a characteristic
angular distribution based on the CC optical depth $\tau_0$, in particular for
$\tau_0 >$ 10 the LP follows the Chandrasekhar (1950) distribution. In light of
the vast number of recent IXPE spectro-polarimetric observations of BHs,
testing this approach in combination with spectral analysis of these sources by
other missions is desirable. In particular, the BH source, 4U 1957+115 was
observed with IXPE in the high/soft state for which $P\sim 2\%$ was found
(Marra et al. 2024). To apply the new method, in addition to knowing $P$ for a
given source, it is necessary to estimate the CC optical depth $\tau_0$ and
then to calculate of the best-fit photon index $\Gamma$ and the plasma
temperature $kT_e$. We present the X-ray spectral analysis of 4U~1957+11 using
data from IXPE, NuSTAR, NICER, RXTE}, Swift, Suzaku and ASCA. We show that the
X-ray source spectra are well described by the Comptonization model with
$\Gamma$ varying from 1.5 to 3. We find a monotonic increase in $\Gamma$ with
the mass accretion rate, $\dot M$, and a final saturation of the index at
$\Gamma\sim3$ for high $\dot M$. We determine a BH mass by the scaling method:
$M_{1957}=4.8 \pm 1.8~M_{\odot}$, assuming a source distance of 22 kpc, using H
1743-322, 4U 1630-47, and GRS 1915+105 as reference sources.

Abstract: We study the cooling of isolated dark-matter-admixed neutron stars, employing
a realistic nuclear equation of state and realistic nuclear pairing gaps,
together with fermionic dark matter of variable particle mass and dark-matter
fraction. The related parameter space is scanned for the stellar structural and
cooling properties. We find that a consistent description of all current
cooling data requires fast direct Urca cooling and reasonable proton 1S0 gaps.
but no neutron 3P2 pairing. Dark matter affects the cooling properties by a
modification of the nuclear density profiles, but also changes stellar radius
and maximum mass. Possible signals of a large dark matter content could be a
very massive but slow-cooling star or a very light but fast-cooling star.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Starobinsky引力（含二次修正项）对中子星结构的影响，特别是Ricci标量的行为和最大稳定质量的变化。

Method: 采用两相混合物质模型（夸克物质和强子物质），数值求解修正的TOV方程。

Result: Ricci标量在星体外逐渐衰减至零，最大稳定质量随α增加，MIT-BSk21模型支持2.07M⊙的质量。

Conclusion: Starobinsky引力下中子星的最大质量可能超过广义相对论的预测，旋转配置下质量阈值可达2.48-2.59M⊙。

Abstract: We investigate the stellar structure of neutron stars in the framework of
Starobinsky gravity, characterized by a quadratic correction to the
Einstein-Hilbert action, $f(R) = R + \alpha R^2$. In order to {\em preserve
causality throughout\/} the star, we adopt a two-phase hybrid construction for
the stellar matter, in which the core region consists of deconfined quark
matter described by the MIT bag model, while the outer layers are composed of
hadronic matter represented by unified equations of state such as SLy4, BSk20,
and BSk21. Within this framework, we derive the modified field equations with
static spherical symmetry, and numerically integrate the corresponding
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations with the chosen hybrid equations of
state. Our analyses show that, unlike in general relativity, the Ricci scalar
remains nonzero outside the stellar surface, and gradually falls to zero beyond
50 km, while the stellar surface remains within 10--12 km for the hybrid
equations of state considered. This extended Ricci scalar profile arises from
the extra degree of freedom (scalaron) inherent in Starobinsky gravity, which
also contributes to the gravitational mass outside the star, causing the ADM
mass measured at infinity to exceed the stellar mass at the surface.
Nevertheless, the key physical relationships, such as the mass-central density
and mass-radius curves, remain consistent with what is expected physically.
Notably, we find that the maximum stable mass of neutron stars increases with
the Starobinsky parameter $\alpha$, with the combined MIT-BSk21 model
supporting an ADM mass of up to $2.07 \, M_\odot$ for $\alpha = 10\,r_g^2$.
This theoreical limit for a nonrotating neutron star suggests that a rotating
configuration could reach mass thresholds in the range of $2.48$ to $2.59 \,
M_\odot$, considering that rapid rotation can enhance the maximum mass by
approximately 20--25\%.

Abstract: Searching for radio pulsars orbiting around the Galactic centre black hole
(BH), Sagittarius A$^\star$ (Sgr A$^\star$), represents a holy grail goal for
large-area radio telescopes, in particular for the Square Kilometre Array.
Follow-up timing observation of such a PSR-Sgr A$^\star$ binary system with an
orbital period $\lesssim O(1\,{\rm year})$ will bring forward a handful of new
tests on different aspects of fundamental physics that are barely accessible
with other means. However, mass perturbation in the Galactic centre harms the
gravitational cleanness of PSR-Sgr A$^\star$ systems. In order to flexibly
account for perturbations, a numerical pulsar timing model is gradually being
built, which can be used to probe the spacetime around Sgr A$^\star$ BH and
study the nature of dark matter.

Result: 发现当前模型存在局限性，需未来多波段和多信使观测以区分不同解释。

Conclusion: 未来设施对类似事件的持续研究对解决理论挑战至关重要。

Abstract: The detection of gamma-ray burst GRB~221009A has attracted significant
attention due to its record brightness and the first-ever detection of
multi-TeV $\gamma$-rays from a GRB. Located at redshift $z=0.151$, this event
is relatively nearby by GRB standards yet remains cosmologically distant,
making the survival of multi-TeV photons surprising. The Large High Altitude
Air Shower Observatory detected photons with energies up to $\sim 13$~TeV
during the early afterglow phase, challenging standard EBL models. We
investigate whether several theoretical frameworks can explain this anomalous
emission: reduced EBL opacity due to cosmic voids along the line of sight,
novel emission mechanisms within the GRB environment, secondary $\gamma$-ray
production through cosmic-ray cascades, and new-physics scenarios involving
Lorentz-invariance violation or axion-like particles. Our analysis highlights
the exceptional nature of this event and ongoing theoretical tensions about the
dominant physical processes. We discuss the limitations of current models and
identify specific observational signatures that future multiwavelength and
multi-messenger observations could provide to discriminate between competing
explanations. Continued study of similar events with next-generation facilities
will be crucial for resolving these challenges and advancing our understanding
of extreme particle acceleration in astrophysical environments.

Abstract: Over several dedicated programs that include targets beyond the main
cosmological samples, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collected
spectra for 311,102 unique objects in two fields centered on the COSMOS and
XMM-LSS fields. In this work, we develop spectroscopic redshift robustness
criteria for those spectra, validate these criteria using visual inspection,
and provide two custom Value-Added Catalogs with our redshift
characterizations. With these criteria, we reliably classify 217,037 galaxies
below z < 1.6, 9,688 quasars and 35,505 stars. As a critical element in
characterizing the selection function, we provide the description of 70
different algorithms that were used to select these targets from imaging data.
To facilitate joint imaging/spectroscopic analyses, we provide row-matched
photometry from the Dark Energy Camera, Hyper-Suprime Cam, and public
COSMOS2020 photometric catalogs. Finally, we demonstrate example applications
of these large catalogs to photometric redshift estimation, cluster finding,
and completeness studies.

TL;DR: 论文提出通过引入Gauss-Bonnet耦合项，调整张量与标量比r，缓解ACT数据与其他宇宙学数据集在标量谱指数n_s上的矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ACT数据与其他数据集在n_s上的不一致问题，使更多膨胀模型符合观测约束。

Method: 利用Gauss-Bonnet耦合项调整r，保持n_s几乎不变，应用于混沌膨胀、E模型、T模型和山顶膨胀。

Result: 发现参数空间广泛区域与ACT的CMB约束一致。

Conclusion: Gauss-Bonnet耦合能帮助多种膨胀模型与当前CMB测量结果一致。

Abstract: Recent analyses combining Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data with other
cosmological datasets report a higher scalar spectral index $n_s$, creating
tension with a wide range of inflationary models. Since a Gauss-Bonnet term
with a coupling function $\xi(\phi) = 3\lambda/[4V(\phi)]$ leaves $n_s$ nearly
unchanged (up to a field rescaling) while reducing the tensor-to-scalar ratio
$r$ by a factor $(1-\lambda)$, so choosing $(1-\lambda)$ sufficiently small
effectively removes $r$ as a limiting observable, making it easier for
inflationary models to satisfy the latest observational constraints and
alleviating this tension. Applying this mechanism to chaotic inflation,
E-models, T-models, and hilltop inflation, we find that broad regions of
parameter space become consistent with the latest ACT-based CMB constraints.
These results demonstrate that Gauss-Bonnet couplings can help bring a broad
class of inflationary models into agreement with current CMB measurements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决原始核合成预测与观测锂丰度之间的差异，理解其起源。

Method: 结合标准化学演化模型与层次结构形成情景，确定锂丰度随[Fe/H]的变化，并与观测数据（如J0023+0307和SMSS J0313-6708）对比。

Result: Spite高原在[Fe/H]范围-8.0到-2.0内自然形成，锂丰度为1.81×10^-10；J0023+0307和SMSS J0313-6708的形成时间与Pop III恒星爆炸相关。

Conclusion: Spite高原是Pop III恒星形成的观测特征，观测数据支持Pop III恒星质量范围为10-100 M⊙，但140-260 M⊙恒星的贡献未被排除。

Abstract: The discrepancy between the predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis and the
observed lithium abundance in Spite plateau stars has been attributed either to
a challenge to the standard model of nucleosynthesis or to stellar processes
occurring after the stars formed. To understand the origin of this discrepancy,
it is crucial to link the cosmic star formation rate with a chemical enrichment
model that incorporates the yields of both Population (Pop) III and II stars.
It is within this framework that the evolution of lithium can be determined.
The primary goal is to demonstrate that there is no discrepancy between the
predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis and the observed lithium abundance.
By combining a standard chemical evolution model with the hierarchical
structure formation scenario, it is possible to determine the lithium abundance
as a function of $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]$. The model's results are compared with
observational data, including two extremely iron-poor stars: J0023+0307 and
SMSS J0313-6708. The Spite plateau is naturally established in the range $-8.0
\lesssim [\mathrm{Fe/H}] \lesssim -2.0$ with $^{7}\mathrm{Li/H}$ $\sim 1.81
\times 10^{-10}$. We find that J0023+0307 could have formed $\sim 4.4 \times
10^{5} - 1.3 \times 10^{6}$ years after the explosion of the first Pop III star
in the Universe, whereas for SMSS J0313-6708 this event would have occurred
$\sim 2.2 \times 10^{5} - 4.4 \times 10^{5}$ years later. The Spite plateau
serves as an observational signature of the formation of Pop III stars. The
abundances observed in J0023+0307 and SMSS J0313-6708 are consistent with Pop
III progenitor stars in the mass range $10-100 M_{\odot}$. However, if some
high-redshift star formation occurs within subhalo-like structures, the
contribution of stars in the mass range $140-260 M_{\odot}$ to the formation of
the extended Spite plateau cannot be ruled out.

TL;DR: 扩展了随机δN形式主义以包含相互作用理论中的噪声修正，并推导了修正后的Langevin和Fokker-Planck方程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究相互作用理论中随机噪声的修正，以更准确地计算宇宙学相关函数。

Method: 通过in-in形式主义计算功率谱的一环修正，推导噪声幅度的修正公式。

Result: 噪声幅度修正为$\frac{H}{2 \pi} \Big(1+ \frac{ \Delta {\cal P}_{\cal R} }{ {\cal P}^{(0)}_{ {\cal R} } }\Big)^{\frac{1}{2}}$。

Conclusion: 相互作用理论中噪声幅度的修正在宇宙学计算中不可忽略。

Abstract: Stochastic $\delta N$ formalism is a powerful tool to calculate the
cosmological correlators non-perturbatively. However, it requires the initial
data for the amplitude of the noise on the initial flat hypersurface which for
a free theory during inflation is fixed to be $\frac{H}{2 \pi}$. In this work,
we study the setups where the underlying theory involves interactions and the
stochastic noises inherit these interactions. We extend the stochastic $\delta
N$ formalism to these setups and rewrite the corresponding Langevin and
Fokker-Planck equations in which the QFT corrections in the amplitude of the
noises are taken into account. As an example, in the three-phase SR-USR-SR
setup which is employed for PBHs formation, the modification in the amplitude
of noise is calculated from the one-loop corrections in power spectrum via
in-in formalism. We show that in these setups the amplitude of the stochastic
noise is modified to $\frac{H}{2 \pi} \Big(1+ \frac{ \Delta {\cal P}_{\cal R}
}{ {\cal P}^{(0)}_{ {\cal R} } }\Big)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ in which $ \frac{\Delta
{\cal P}_{\cal R} }{ {\cal P}^{(0)}_{{\cal R} } }$ is the fractional one-loop
correction in power spectrum.

*Valerio De Luca,Gabriele Franciolini,Antonio Riotto*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: GW231123是LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA合作组探测到的最重双黑洞合并事件，位于质量间隙且具有高自旋。研究表明其可能来源于初始质量较小的原初黑洞，并通过宇宙学吸积解释观测到的质量和自旋。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释GW231123的质量和自旋特性，探讨其是否源于原初黑洞，并验证这一假设的可观测性。

Method: 利用原初黑洞框架，结合宇宙学吸积模型，分析GW231123的质量和自旋数据。

Result: GW231123的质量和自旋特性可以通过原初黑洞框架解释，但参数空间接近现有观测的排除区域。

Conclusion: 未来观测（如O5运行和下一代探测器）将验证这一假设，并可能发现更多类似事件。

Abstract: GW231123, the heaviest binary black hole merger detected by the
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration to date, lies in the pair-instability mass gap
and exhibits unusually high component spins. In this letter, we show that both
merging black holes may have a primordial origin with smaller initial masses.
The observed masses and, crucially, the spins of GW231123 are naturally
accommodated within the most vanilla primordial black hole framework, once
cosmological accretion is taken into account. Interestingly, the parameter
space needed to explain the inferred GW231123 rate is at the edge of the
exclusion region from Xray and CMB observations, suggesting that this
interpretation can be either confirmed or ruled out. The upcoming O5 observing
run by the collaboration should detect ${\cal O}(20)$ similar events, testing
their mass-spin correlation, while next-generation detectors would be capable
of observing high redshift events, as predicted in this scenario.

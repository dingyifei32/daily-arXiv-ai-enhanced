A key next step towards characterizing this signal and identifying\nits origin is to map the sky distribution of its power. Several strategies have\nbeen proposed to reconstruct this distribution using PTA data. In this work, we\ncompare these different strategies to determine which one is best suited to\ndetect GWB anisotropies of different topologies. We find that, for both\nlocalized and large-scale anisotropies, reconstruction methods based on pixel\nand radiometer maps are the most promising. However, in both scenarios, even\nthe optimistically large anisotropic signals discussed in this work remain\nchallenging to detect with near-future PTA sensitivities. For example, we find\nthat for a GWB hotspot contributing to $80\\%$ of the GWB power in the second\nfrequency bin, detection probabilities reach at most $\\mathcal{O}(10\\%)$ for a\nPTA with noise properties comparable with the ones of the upcoming IPTA third\ndata release. Finally, we consider the fundamental limitations that cosmic\nvariance poses to these kinds of searches by deriving the smallest deviations\nfrom isotropy that could be detected by an idealized PTA with no experimental\nor pulsar noise."}

This necessity arises from our findings\nthat a void's properties are more fundamentally tied to its rank within its\ncontemporary population than to its absolute size. Using this framework, we\nshow that the evolution of halo voids stabilizes at redshifts below $z \\simeq\n1$, driven primarily by cosmic expansion rather than ongoing halo formation.

The decay indices of optical LCs following a simple\npower-law (PL) are shallower than corresponding X-ray LCs, indicative of a\nspectral break between two wavelengths. Not all LCs with PL decay align with\nthe forward shock model and require additional components such as energy\ninjection or a structured jet.

However, in four cases, plateaus followed by steep decay may\nhave an internal origin. The optical luminosity observed during the plateau is\ntightly correlated with the break time, indicative of a magnetar as their\npossible central engine. For LCs with early bumps, the peak position,\ncorrelations between the parameters, and observed achromaticity allowed us to\nconstrain their origin as the onset of afterglow, off-axis jet, late\nre-brightening, etc. In conclusion, the ensemble of observed features is\nexplained through diverse physical mechanisms or emissions observed from\ndifferent outflow locations and, in turn, diversity among possible progenitors."}

Since its launch, the Fermi-Large Area Telescope\n(LAT), the main instrument onboard the Fermi satellite, has remarkably unveiled\nthe sky at GeV energies providing outstanding results in time-domain gamma-ray\nastrophysics. In particular, LAT has observed some of the most powerful\ntransient phenomena in the Universe (such as gamma-ray bursts, blazar flares,\nmagnetar flares, ...) enabling the possibility to test our current\nunderstanding of the laws of physics in extreme conditions. In this paper I\nwill review some of the main recent results with a focus on the transient\nphenomena seen by LAT with a multi-wavelength and multi-messenger connection."}

Within a fermionic DM model that interacts only through\ngravitation, along with a well-constrained nuclear matter equation of state, we\nshow that the simultaneous mass and radius measurement of PSRJ0740+6620 reduces\nthe uncertainty of DM central energy density by more than 50\\% compared to the\nresults obtained from using the two observables independently, while other DM\nparameters remain unconstrained.

Kapadia"], "title": "Early warning for lensed gravitational wave counterparts from time delays of their host galaxies observed in the optical", "comment": "12 pages, 9 figures", "summary": "Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) can be leveraged to\nprovide early-warning times of $\\mathcal{O}({\\rm hours})$ to $\\mathcal{O}({\\rm\ndays})$ before the merger of Binary Neutron Stars (BNSs) and Neutron Star Black\nHoles (NSBHs). This in turn could enable electromagnetic (EM) telescopes to\ncapture emissions surrounding the time of the merger. In this work, we assess\nthe practicability of lensing-driven early-warning by analysing optical images\nof the lensed host galaxy to predict the arrival time of subsequent BNS/NSBH\nsignals following the observation of the first signal. We produce mock lenses\nwith image quality and resolution similar to images taken with the Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) and the ground-based Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) on the Subaru\ntelescope. We compare the time delay uncertainties between these two cases for\ntypical lensed image configurations and multiplicity. These include doubles and\nquads, and among quads: the fold, cusp, cross image configurations. We find\nthat time delay uncertainties for doubles are comparable for both HST and HSC\nmocks. On the other hand, quads tend to provide accurate time-delay predictions\n(typical relative error $\\sim0.1$) with HST. Analysis of a real lens led to a\ndifference in time-delay estimates of $\\mathcal{O}(\\rm days)$ between the\npredictions derived from HST and HSC data. Our work therefore strongly\nadvocates the need for high-resolution EM observations of lensed host galaxies\nto feasibly enable lensing-driven early-warning."}

In\naddition to previously described neural-net (NN) weights, we introduce here\npoint-spread function weights and particle background weights, which can be\ncritical for faint sources. In some cases these can be augmented by time/phase\nand energy weights. We provide a publicly available analysis tool to\nincorporate these new weights, validate our method on simulated data, and test\nit on archival IXPE observations. Together these weights decrease the area of\nthe polarization uncertainty contour by a factor of two and will be essential\nfor background-limited IXPE observations."}

### [1] [Cosmic Dipoles from Large-Scale Structure Surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08931)
*Jaiyul Yoo,Matteo Magi,Dragan Huterer*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 论文研究了宇宙微波背景（CMB）、超新星和星系巡天中的宇宙偶极子，发现观测结果与标准宇宙学模型不一致，可能对ΛCDM模型构成挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观测到的宇宙偶极子（CMB、超新星和星系）之间存在不一致性，这与标准宇宙学模型的预期不符，可能暗示模型存在问题。

Method: 在标准ΛCDM模型框架下，详细分析了CMB、超新星和星系巡天中宇宙偶极子的来源，并探讨了观测速度与内在速度的影响。

Result: 观测速度是宇宙偶极子的主要贡献因素，而内在速度随红移增加迅速减小。理论上，CMB、超新星和星系的偶极子应方向一致但幅度可能不同。

Conclusion: 研究澄清了文献中的一些常见误解，并指出宇宙偶极子的不一致性可能对标准宇宙学模型构成挑战。

Abstract: Large-scale structure surveys can be used to measure the dipole in the cosmic
microwave background (CMB), in the luminosity distances inferred from type-Ia
supernova observations, and in the spatial distribution of galaxies and
quasars. The measurements of these cosmic dipoles appear to be mutually
inconsistent, even though they are expected to indicate the common observer
velocity. This observational tension may represent a significant challenge to
the standard model of cosmology. Here we study in detail what contributes to
the cosmic dipoles from CMB, supernova, and galaxy survey in the standard
$\Lambda$CDM model, though our theoretical model can be applied beyond the
standard model. While measurements of the cosmic dipoles yield the relative
velocities between the source samples and the observer velocity, the motion of
the observer is the dominant contribution in the conformal Newtonian gauge, and
the intrinsic velocities of the samples fall steeply with increasing redshift
of the sources. Hence the cosmic dipoles of CMB, type-Ia supernovae, and
galaxies should be aligned but can have different amplitudes. We also clarify
several misconceptions that are commonly found in the literature.

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 论文报道了对高红移（z=1.07）大质量星系团SPT-CL J0546-5345的首次强透镜分析，发现其具有显著的透镜效应和质量分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高红移星系团的强透镜效应，填补已知透镜星系团在高红移区域的空白。

Method: 利用JWST/NIRCam和HST成像数据，识别并分析多重成像背景星系，约束星系团的质量分布。

Result: 测得有效爱因斯坦半径和投影质量，发现其与哈勃前沿场星系团相似，但宇宙年龄更年轻。

Conclusion: SPT-CL J0546-5345是一个高红移、高质量的强透镜星系团，为研究早期宇宙提供了重要样本。

Abstract: Massive galaxy clusters act as prominent strong-lenses. Due to a combination
of observational biases, cluster evolution and lensing efficiency, most of the
known cluster lenses lie typically at $z_{l}\sim0.2-0.7$, with only a few
prominent examples at higher redshifts. Here we report a first strong-lensing
analysis of the massive galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0546-5345 at a redshift
$z_l=1.07$. This cluster was first detected through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
effect, with a high estimated mass for its redshift of $M_{200,c} = (7.95 \pm
0.92) \times 10^{14}\,M_{\odot}$. Using recent JWST/NIRCam and archival HST
imaging, we identify at least 10 secure and 6 candidate sets of multiply imaged
background galaxies, which we use to constrain the mass distribution in the
cluster. We derive effective Einstein radii of $\theta_{E}= 18.1 \pm 1.8 ''$
for a source at $z_{s}=3$, and $\theta_{E}= 27.9 \pm 2.8 ''$ for a source at
$z_{s}=9$. The total projected mass within a $200$ kpc radius around the
strong-lensing region is $M(<200\,\mathrm{kpc}) = (1.9 \pm 0.3) \times
10^{14}\,M_{\odot}$. While our results rely on photometric redshifts warranting
spectroscopic follow-up, this central mass resembles that of the Hubble
Frontier Fields clusters - although SPT-CL J0546-5345 is observed when the
Universe was $\sim 3-4$ Gyr younger. Amongst the multiply-imaged sources, we
identify a hyperbolic-umbilic-like configuration, and, thanks to its point-like
morphology, a possible Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). If confirmed
spectroscopically, it will add to just a handful of other quasars and AGN known
to be multiply lensed by galaxy clusters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高红移星系的光度函数，探索引力透镜效应带来的星系检测优势，同时识别和量化低红移污染源对结果的潜在影响。

Method: 利用放大偏置概念，对HFF透镜场的光度红移目录进行首次统计污染水平估计。

Result: 发现约56%的3.5 < z_phot < 5.5样本可能是低红移污染源，影响高红移宇宙研究的准确性。

Conclusion: 建议通过JWST观测单独识别和消除污染源，以提高高红移宇宙研究的可靠性。

Abstract: Gravitational lensing by massive galaxy clusters enables faint distant
galaxies to be more abundantly detected than in blank fields, thereby allowing
one to construct galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) to an unprecedented depth at
high redshifts. Intriguingly, photometric redshift catalogs (e.g. Shipley et
al. (2018)) constructed from the Hubble Frontier Fields survey display an
excess of z$\gtrsim$4 galaxies in the cluster lensing fields and are not seen
in accompanying blank parallel fields. The observed excess, while maybe a gift
of gravitational lensing, could also be from misidentified low-z contaminants
having similar spectral energy distributions as high-z galaxies. In the latter
case, the contaminants may result in nonphysical turn-ups in UV LFs and/or wash
out faint end turnovers predicted by contender cosmological models to
$\Lambda$CDM. Here, we employ the concept of magnification bias to perform the
first statistical estimation of contamination levels in HFF lensing field
photometric redshift catalogs. To our great worry, while we were able to
reproduce a lower-z lensed sample, it was found $\sim56\%$ of $3.5 < z_{phot} <
5.5$ samples are likely low-z contaminants! Widely adopted Lyman Break
Galaxy-like selection rules in literature may give a 'cleaner' sample
magnification bias-wise but we warn readers the resulting sample would also be
less complete. Individual mitigation of the contaminants is arguably the best
way for the investigation of faint high-z Universe, and this may be made
possible with JWST observations.

### [4] [Alleviating the Hubble tension with Torsion Condensation (TorC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09228)
*Sinah Legner,Will Handley,Will Barker*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 利用Planck 2018数据研究Torsion Condensation（TorC）的宇宙学参数约束，发现TorC可能缓解哈勃张力，但不足以显著优于ΛCDM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TorC是Poincaré规范理论的一种形式，旨在通过引入扭率自由度扩展广义相对论，为宇宙学提供自然扩展。

Method: 使用PolyChord嵌套采样算法和修改版CAMB，通过Cobaya接口约束TorC的两个额外参数。

Result: TorC允许更大的哈勃常数，缓解Planck 2018与SH0Es 2020数据集间的统计张力，但Bayesian模型比较未显著支持TorC。

Conclusion: TorC是有潜力的引力理论，未来观测数据将对其进一步验证。

Abstract: Constraints on the cosmological parameters of Torsion Condensation (TorC) are
investigated using Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background data. TorC is a case
of Poincar\'e gauge theory -- a formulation of gravity motivated by the gauge
field theories underlying fundamental forces in the standard model of particle
physics. Unlike general relativity, TorC incorporates intrinsic torsion degrees
of freedom while maintaining second-order field equations. At specific
parameter values, it reduces to the $\Lambda$CDM model, providing a natural
extension to standard cosmology. The base model of TorC introduces two
parameters beyond those in $\Lambda$CDM: the initial value of the torsion
scalar field and its time derivative -- one can absorb the latter by allowing
the dark energy density to float. To constrain these parameters, `PolyChord`
nested sampling algorithm is employed, interfaced via `Cobaya` with a modified
version of `CAMB`. Our results indicate that TorC allows for a larger inferred
Hubble constant, offering a potential resolution to the Hubble tension. Tension
analysis using the $R$-statistic shows that TorC alleviates the statistical
tension between the Planck 2018 and SH0Es 2020 datasets, though this
improvement is not sufficient to decisively favour TorC over $\Lambda$CDM in a
Bayesian model comparison. This study highlights TorC as a compelling theory of
gravity, demonstrating its potential to address cosmological tensions and
motivating further investigations of extended theories of gravity within a
cosmological context. As current and upcoming surveys -- including Euclid,
Roman Space Telescope, Vera C. Rubin Observatory, LISA, and Simons Observatory
-- deliver data on gravity across all scales, they will offer critical tests of
gravity models like TorC, making the present a pivotal moment for exploring
extended theories of gravity.

### [5] [Modeling the impacts of galaxy intrinsic alignments on weak lensing peak statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09232)

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 论文研究了弱引力透镜（WL）峰值统计中星系固有排列（IAs）的影响，并提出了一个包含IA效应的理论模型，以修正其对宇宙学参数估计的偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱引力透镜峰值统计能捕捉宇宙非线性结构，但IA效应会引入偏差，影响高精度应用。本文旨在量化IA影响并提出修正方法。

Method: 扩展了基于晕的模型，纳入IA效应，包括星系团透镜轮廓修正和形状噪声相关性。通过半解析星系形成模拟验证模型。

Result: 模型在卫星星系径向排列分散角大于45°时有效。若不修正IA，Euclid/CSST类巡天的S8参数偏差可达8σ；修正后不仅能消除偏差，还能约束卫星IA分散角。

Conclusion: 提出的模型能有效修正IA效应，提升弱引力透镜峰值统计的精度，并为卫星IA约束提供新方法。

Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing (WL) peak statistics capture cosmic non-linear
structures and can provide additional cosmological information complementary to
cosmic shear two-point correlation analyses. They have been applied to
different WL surveys successfully. To further facilitate their high precision
applications, it is very timely to investigate the impacts of different
systematics on WL peak statistics and how to mitigate them. Concerning the
influence from galaxy intrinsic alignments (IAs), in this paper, we develop a
theoretical model for WL high peaks taking into account the IA effects. It is
an extension of our previous halo-based model. The IA corrections mainly
include the modification of the lensing profile of clusters of galaxies due to
the alignments of satellite galaxies and the additional shape noise
correlations. We validate our model using simulations with the semi-analytical
galaxy formation. We consider the cases where the satellite galaxies are
averagely radially aligned toward the centers of their host clusters but with
different dispersions $\sigma_{\theta}$. We show that our model works well for
$\sigma_{\theta}>45^{\circ}$. If the IA corrections are not included in the
model, for the Euclid/CSST-like source galaxy distribution and the survey area
of $\sim 1000 deg^2$, the IA induced bias on $S_8$ can reach $\sim 8\sigma$
even for $\sigma_{\theta}=75^{\circ}$. With our model, not only the bias can be
well mitigated, but also we can constrain the satellite IA to the level of {\bf
$\sigma(\sigma_{\theta})\sim \pm 24^{\circ}$} simultaneously from WL high peak
analyses alone using data from such a survey.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了宇宙学原理的潜在偏差，通过Bianchi I几何模型约束剪切参数Σ₀，发现某些模型中Σ₀显著非零，挑战了传统假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期观测显示宇宙可能存在各向异性膨胀，挑战标准宇宙学模型的宇宙学原理。

Method: 使用Boltzmann代码CLASS实现各向异性模型，并通过MontePython采样器探索参数空间。

Result: 在特定模型中，Σ₀显著非零（约10⁻⁴），且与观测一致，但ΛCDM模型仍统计上更优。

Conclusion: 各向异性模型为宇宙学异常提供新视角，需进一步研究其影响。

Abstract: The cosmological principle is a cornerstone of the standard cosmological
model. However, recent observations suggest potential deviations from this
assumption, hinting at a small anisotropic expansion. Such an expansion can
arise from sources that break rotational invariance. A minimal realization of
this scenario is described by a Bianchi I geometry, where each spatial
direction evolves at a different rate, and the degree of anisotropy is
quantified by the shear parameter $\Sigma$. In this work, we constrain the
present-day value of the shear, $\Sigma_0$, by confronting theoretical
predictions with recent cosmological data. We implement various anisotropic
models within the Boltzmann code \texttt{CLASS} and explore their parameter
space using the sampler \texttt{MontePython}. Although our results show that
$\Sigma_0$ is model-dependent, notably, in one specific scenario considering a
homogeneous scalar field coupled to a 2-form field, $\Sigma_0 = 0$ is excluded
at the $2\sigma$ confidence level, with mean value around $|\Sigma_0| \sim
10^{-4}$ while remaining consistent with observations. These findings challenge
the conventional assumption that cosmic shear is negligible in the present
universe. Moreover, the anisotropic expansion in this model is driven by a
steep scalar field potential, a feature often found in supergravity-inspired
scenarios. While anisotropic models offer interesting alternatives and could
help explain some cosmological anomalies, they generally introduce additional
parameters, making the standard $\Lambda$CDM model statistically favored in
most cases. Still, they remain compatible with current observations and provide
new perspectives on features not fully explained within the standard framework.
These results highlight the importance of further exploring anisotropic
cosmologies to better understand their implications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过未来实验（如LIGO、FAST、SKA等）提高对早期宇宙标量诱导引力波的探测灵敏度，以验证其存在或设置限制。

Method: 结合CMB数据和FAST/SKA提供的引力波背景上下限，分析两种情景（未探测到和成功探测到引力波）下的标量谱指数约束。

Result: 在ΛCDM+r模型中，标量谱指数在上下限情景下分别为0.9589和0.9661，变化显著；其他模型中的α_s和β_s也显示明显变化。

Conclusion: FAST/SKA提供的上下限对标量诱导引力波的探测具有重要影响，标量谱指数的变化可作为潜在探测指标。

Abstract: Gravitational wave astronomy presents a promising opportunity to directly
observe scalar-induced gravitational waves originating from the early universe.
Future experiments, including ground-based interferometers like LIGO and Virgo,
the Pulsar Timing Array, and telescopes such as FAST and SKA, are poised to
significantly enhance sensitivity to these gravitational waves. In this paper,
we combined Cosmic Microwave Background data with upper or lower limits of the
stochastic gravitational wave background provided by FAST or SKA, to constrain
scalar-induced gravitational waves. To provide a comprehensive forecast, we
consider two scenarios: one where FAST or SKA does not detect scalar-induced
gravitational waves, thereby setting an upper limit on the fractional energy
density; and another where these waves are detected successfully, thus
establishing a lower limit on the fractional energy density. In the
$\Lambda$CDM+$r$ model, the scalar spectral index of the power-law power
spectrum is constrained to $n_s=0.9589^{+0.0021}_{-0.0011}$ from the
combinations of CMB+BAO+SKA datasets in the upper limit scenario. The
constraint shifts to $n_s = 0.9661^{+0.0027}_{-0.0039}$ in the lower limit
scenario. Comparing with the constraint from the combinations of CMB+BAO
datasets, the scalar spectral index $n_s$ exhibits significant changes, which
could serve as an indicator for detecting scalar-induced gravitational waves.
In the $\Lambda$CDM+$\alpha_s$+$r$ model and the
$\Lambda$CDM+$\alpha_s$+$\beta_s$+$r$ model, the running of the scalar spectral
index $\alpha_s$ and the running of the running of the scalar spectral index
$\beta_s$ also show notable variations, suggesting potential indicators. The
numerical findings clearly demonstrate the impact of the upper and lower limits
provided by FAST or SKA.

TL;DR: 论文首次观测到大尺度星系形状自相关（II相关性），扩展至100 h⁻¹ Mpc，为宇宙学和星系形成研究提供了新窗口。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测量星系形状自相关（II相关性）对宇宙学和理解大质量椭圆星系形成至关重要，但因其信噪比低而更具挑战性。

Method: 利用SDSS和SDSS-III BOSS数据，分析LRG、LOWZ和CMASS星系样本，通过展开Legendre多项式分离视线投影效应并增强信号。

Result: 所有样本的II相关性呈现明显的幂律形式，结合II(+)和II(−)相关性可将检测显著性提高约10%。

Conclusion: 该研究为探测形状自相关中的独特信号（如引力波张量扰动）建立了实用框架。

Abstract: Measuring the autocorrelation of galaxy shapes, the so-called
intrinsic-intrinsic (II) correlation is important for both cosmology and
understanding the formation of massive elliptical galaxies. However, such
measurements are significantly more challenging than the cross-correlation with
galaxy density (GI correlation) due to the much lower signal-to-noise ratio. In
this paper, we report the first observational evidence for large-scale
intrinsic alignments measured from the ellipticity autocorrelations, extending
out to $100\,h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}$. From SDSS and SDSS-III BOSS, we analyze over
the redshift range $0.16\leq z\leq 0.70$ luminous red galaxies (LRG), LOWZ and
CMASS galaxy samples, the latter two of which are cross-matched with
high-quality DESI imaging data. By expanding one of the two II correlation
functions, II($-$), in terms of the associated Legendre polynomials, we
effectively isolate the line-of-sight projection effects and enhance the
signal. The resulting correlation for all three samples exhibits a clear
power-law form. We also show that combining the two II correlations, II($+$)
and II($-$), increases the detection significance by $\sim 10\%$, though they
appear equivalent mathematically under the linear alignment model. Importantly,
this measurement opens a new observational window for probing signals uniquely
encoded in shape autocorrelations, such as tensor perturbations from the
gravitational waves. This analysis establishes a practical framework for
probing such effects.

Motivation: 研究在非冷暗物质（CDM）范式下，粒子追踪算法在SIDM模拟中的适用性，以改进子晕追踪的准确性和一致性。

Method: 应用粒子追踪算法Symfind到具有大截面振幅的SIDM模拟中，评估其性能，并与传统方法对比。

Result: 在SIDM中，核心粒子追踪技术不一定准确；Symfind在某些情况下优于传统方法，但在其他情况下无优势。

Conclusion: 建议采用混合方法，结合粒子追踪和传统技术的优势，以生成更完整和鲁棒的SIDM子晕目录。

Abstract: Cosmological N-body simulations are among the primary tools for studying
structure formation in the Universe. Analyses of these simulations critically
depend on accurately identifying and tracking dark matter subhalos over time.
In recent years, several new algorithms have been developed to improve the
accuracy and consistency of subhalo tracking in cold dark matter simulations.
These algorithms should be revisited in the context of new physics beyond
gravity, which can modify the evolution and final properties of subhalo
populations. In this work, we apply the particle-tracking-based subhalo finder
Symfind to velocity-dependent self-interacting dark matter simulations with
large cross section amplitudes to assess the performance of particle-tracking
methods beyond the CDM paradigm. We find that the core-particle-tracking
technique, which is key to the success of these algorithms in CDM, does not
always yield accurate results in SIDM. The interplay between dark matter
self-interactions and tidal stripping can cause the diffusion of core particles
to larger radii, leading particle-tracking-based algorithms to prematurely lose
track of SIDM subhalos. For massive core-expansion subhalos and core-collapse
subhalos that experience close or repeated pericentric passages, a significant
fraction of core particles can be lost, and particle-tracking-based finders
such as Symfind offer no clear advantage over traditional methods that rely on
identifying phase-space overdensities. On the other hand, for subhalos with
large pericentric distances or fewer, more distant passages, Symfind tends to
outperform. These differences depend sensitively on the cross section amplitude
and turnover velocity of the underlying SIDM model. We therefore recommend a
hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both techniques to produce
complete and robust catalogs of core-expansion and core-collapse SIDM subhalos.

TL;DR: 论文通过结合低密度区域的弱透镜信号、星系-星系透镜效应和两点相关函数，改进了对宇宙学参数σ₈的约束，结果与PLANCK一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统透镜研究集中在高密度区域，但为了更全面测试宇宙学模型，需包括低密度区域的透镜效应。

Method: 使用DESI DR9数据构建低密度区域，结合SHAM方法模拟，利用DECaLS DR8的剪切测量进行联合分析。

Result: 低密度区域的透镜信号显著（31.1σ），σ₈约束提升14%，σ₈=0.824±0.015，与PLANCK一致。

Conclusion: 低密度区域的透镜信号对宇宙学分析有重要贡献，但光晕质量和红移误差参数存在显著简并性。

Abstract: Lensing studies are typically carried out around high density regions, such
as groups and clusters, where the lensing signals are significant and
indicative of rich density structures. However, a more comprehensive test of
the cosmological model should also include the lensing effect in low density
regions. In this work, we incorporate the stacked weak lensing signals around
the low density positions, alongside galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy-galaxy
two point correlation function to perform a joint cosmological analysis on
$\sigma_8$. The low density positions are constructed from the DR9 data release
of the DESI legacy imaging survey, using galaxies with r-band absolute
magnitude cut M$<$-21.5 and in the redshift range of 0.18$<$z$<$0.28. In doing
so, we simultaneously parameterize photometric redshift errors and halo mass
uncertainties while building mock catalogs from simulations using the method of
SubHalo Abundance Matching (SHAM). For the weak lensing measurements, we use
the shear estimators derived from the DECaLS DR8 imaging data, processed by the
Fourier\_Quad pipeline. The survey boundaries and masks are fully taken into
account. Our analysis achieves a total significance of $31.1\sigma$ detection
for lensing in the low density positions, which significantly improve the
$\sigma_8$ constraint compared to galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy-galaxy two
point correlation function by 14$\%$. For flat $\Lambda$CDM model, we constrain
$\sigma_8$ =$0.824^{+0.015}_{-0.015}$, which shows a good agreement with the
PLANCK result. Additionally, the halo mass uncertainty $\sigma_{\lg M}$ and
photometric redshift error $\sigma_z$ are constrained to be
$0.565^{+0.086}_{-0.070}$ and $0.004^{+0.004}_{-0.003}$ respectively, which are
somewhat different from our expectations due to the significant degeneracy of
the two parameters.

TL;DR: DESI合作的分析显示，结合BAO测量、Planck CMB数据和SNIa样本后，与ΛCDM模型存在显著偏差。研究发现DESY5 SNIa样本、Planck CMB数据、透镜测量和DESI-DR2 BAO测量是主要影响因素。

Method: 结合不同CMB数据集、BAO测量和DESY5 SNIa样本，在w0waCDM框架下系统分析偏差。

Result: DESY5 SNIa样本（尤其是低红移部分）、Planck CMB数据、透镜测量和DESI-DR2 BAO测量对观测到的偏差贡献最大。其他组合仍与ΛCDM一致。

Conclusion: SNIa系统误差、CMB数据和BAO数据集的选择对动态暗能量模型约束至关重要，需改进数据校准和验证以评估标准模型的潜在偏差。

Abstract: Analyses by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration
suggest a significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model when their baryon
acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements are combined with Planck cosmic
microwave background (CMB) data and various Type Ia supernova (SNIa) samples.
In this work, we systematically investigate the origin of the deviations from
the $\Lambda$CDM reported in recent cosmological analyses by combining
different CMB datasets, BAO measurements, and DESY5 SNIa samples within the
$w_0w_a$CDM framework. We find that the DESY5 SNIa sample, particularly its
low-redshift component (DES-lowz), the Planck CMB data, the lensing
measurements of Planck and ACT-DR6, and the DESI-DR2 BAO measurements
contribute most significantly to the observed tensions. In contrast,
combinations involving DES-SN, WMAP, SPT, and ACT-DR6 remain consistent with
$\Lambda$CDM within $\sim1\sigma$. Our results highlight the critical impact of
SNIa systematics, CMB data, and the choice of BAO dataset on constraints of
dynamical dark energy models. These findings underscore the importance of
improved calibration, homogeneity, and cross-validation of observational
datasets to robustly assess potential deviations from the standard cosmological
model.

Abstract: This paper focuses on extending the use of Minkowski Tensors to analyze
anisotropic signals in cosmological data, focusing on those introduced by
redshift space distortion. We derive the ensemble average of the two
translation-invariant, rank-2 Minkowski Tensors for a matter density field that
is perturbatively non-Gaussian in redshift space. This is achieved through the
Edgeworth expansion of the joint probability density function of the field and
its derivatives, expressing the ensemble averages in terms of cumulants up to
cubic order. Our goal is to connect these theoretical predictions to the
underlying cosmological parameters, allowing for parameter estimation by
measuring them from galaxy surveys. The work builds on previous analyses of
Minkowski Functionals in both real and redshift space and addresses the effects
of Finger-of-God velocity dispersion and shot noise. We validate our
predictions by matching them to measurements of the Minkowski Tensors from dark
matter simulation data, finding that perturbation theory is a qualified
success. Non-perturbative Finger-of-God effects remain significant at
relatively large scales (R< 20 Mpc/h) and are particularly pronounced in the
components parallel to the line of sight.

### [13] [Comparative Study of Structure Formation, Recombination, and Matter--Radiation Equality in \textbf{$f(R, L_m)$} Gravity and \textbf{$Λ$}CDM Cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10101)
*G. K. Goswami,J. P. Saini*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 比较了$f(R, L_m)$引力和标准$\Lambda$CDM宇宙学中三个关键宇宙时期的差异，发现$f(R, L_m)$中结构形成更早，复合时期略有延长，物质-辐射平衡时间不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨$f(R, L_m)$引力理论在宇宙学中的表现，并与标准$\Lambda$CDM模型对比，验证其可行性和差异性。

Method: 使用非线性密度扰动演化方程计算结构形成红移，通过可见性函数研究复合时期，分析能量密度演化确定物质-辐射平衡红移。

Result: $f(R, L_m)$中结构形成更早（$z_c$更高），复合时期略长（FWHM更大），物质-辐射平衡红移更高（$z_{\\mathrm{eq}} \\approx 4203$）。

Conclusion: $f(R, L_m)$引力保留了宇宙学关键特征，同时提供了与标准模型可测试的差异。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparative analysis of three pivotal epochs in
cosmic history: structure formation, recombination, and matter-radiation
equality, within the framework of $f(R, L_m)$ gravity and the standard
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Using a nonlinear evolution equation for density
perturbations, we determine the collapse redshift ($z_c$), showing that cosmic
structures form earlier in $f(R, L_m)$ gravity due to enhanced effective
gravitational coupling. Recombination is studied via the visibility function
$g(z)$, peaking at $z_{\mathrm{rec}} \approx 1092.6$ in both models, consistent
with Planck 2018 data. We compute the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of
$g(z)$ and find a slightly extended decoupling duration in $f(R, L_m)$.
Finally, we analyze the evolution of energy densities and determine the
matter-radiation equality redshift as $z_{\mathrm{eq}} \approx 4203$ in $f(R,
L_m)$ and $z_{\mathrm{eq}} \approx 2779$ in $\Lambda$CDM, with corresponding
cosmic times of approximately $67{,}756$ and $67{,}232$ years, respectively.
These results confirm that $f(R, L_m)$ gravity retains key cosmological
landmarks while introducing testable deviations from the standard paradigm.

Motivation: 寻找无金属星系的直接证据，以验证宇宙早期星系形成的极端条件。

Method: 利用JWST的NIRCam宽视场无缝光谱技术观测星系AMORE6，分析其光谱和形态特征。

Result: AMORE6的氧丰度极低（<0.20%太阳金属丰度），具有低恒星质量、蓝紫外光谱斜率及极紧凑形态，符合原始环境中的恒星形成特征。

Conclusion: AMORE6的发现为宇宙大爆炸模型提供了关键验证，尽管其出现时间较晚，但仍具有重要意义。

Abstract: The existence of galaxies with no elements such as Oxygen - formed by stars
after Big Bang nucleosynthesis - is a key prediction of the cosmological model.
Finding them would provide direct and transformative evidence of the formation
of the first galaxies in extremely different conditions than those observed
today. JWST has enabled the identification of galaxies all the way to cosmic
times of a few hundred million years. However, no pristine "zero-metallicity"
Population III galaxies have been identified so far. Here, we report the
identification of an extremely metal-poor galaxy at redshift z = 5.725
("AMORE6"), about one billion years after the Big Bang, observed near the
critical line of a foreground galaxy cluster, and thus multiply imaged and
magnified (mu = 39-78). Publicly available JWST NIRCam Wide Field Slitless
Spectroscopy (WFSS) spectra consistently detect H$\beta$ at both image
positions, but [O III]4960,5008 remains undetected. This places a firm upper
limit on its oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) < 6.0 (1 sigma), or < 0.20% of
solar metallicity. AMORE6 is characterized by low stellar mass (5.6+0.2-0.1 x
10^5 Msun), very blue rest-frame UV spectral slope, and extremely compact
morphology (effective radius re = 4.0+1.4-1.4 pc). These properties are
consistent with massive star formation in a pristine or near-pristine
environment. The finding of such an example at a relatively late time in cosmic
history is surprising. However, regardless of cosmic epoch, the identification
of a potentially pristine object is a key validation of the Big Bang model.

TL;DR: 论文报告了使用NenuFAR射电干涉仪对宇宙黎明时期（红移z>15）21厘米信号功率谱的最新上限，结果比以往更深。


<details>

Motivation: 研究旨在通过改进数据处理流程，减少干扰，提供对21厘米信号功率谱的更严格限制。

Method: 使用NenuFAR干涉仪进行四晚观测，优化目标区域以减少旁瓣泄漏，改进数据处理流程，特别是强射电源的扣除和低频干扰的抑制。

Result: 在红移z=20.3和z=17.0处，分别获得了2σ上限Δ²₂₁<4.6×10⁵ mK²和Δ²₂₁<5.0×10⁶ mK²，是目前最强的限制。

Conclusion: 结果表明，进一步观测可以显著提高对21厘米信号的限制，并可能排除某些极端模型。

Abstract: We report the deepest upper limits to date on the power spectrum of the 21-cm
signal during the Cosmic Dawn (redshifts: $z>15$), using four nights of
observations with the NenuFAR radio interferometer. The limits are derived from
two redshift bins, centred at $z=20.3$ and $z=17.0$, with integration times of
26.1 h and 23.6 h, from observations of an optimal target field chosen to
minimise sidelobe leakage from bright sources. Our analysis incorporates
improvements to the data processing pipeline, particularly in subtracting
strong radio sources in the primary beam sidelobes and mitigating low-level
radio frequency interference, yielding a 50-fold reduction in the excess
variance compared to a previous analysis of the north celestial pole field. At
$z=20.3$, we achieve a best $2\sigma$ upper limit of $\Delta^{2}_{21}<4.6
\times 10^5 \, \textrm{mK}^{2}$ at $k=0.038$ $h\, \mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$, while at
$z=17.0$, the best limit is $\Delta^{2}_{21}<5.0 \times 10^6 \,
\textrm{mK}^{2}$ at $k=0.041$ $h\, \mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$. These are the strongest
constraints on the 21-cm power spectrum at the respective redshifts, with the
limit at $z = 20.3$ being deeper by more than an order of magnitude over all
previous Cosmic Dawn power spectrum limits. Comparison against simulated exotic
21-cm signals shows that while the $z=20.3$ limits begin to exclude the most
extreme models predicting signals stronger than the EDGES detection, an
order-of-magnitude improvement would constrain signals compatible with EDGES. A
coherence analysis reveals that the excess variance is largely incoherent
across nights for the $z=20.3$ redshift bin, suggesting that deeper
integrations could yield significantly stronger constraints on the 21-cm signal
from the Cosmic Dawn.

Motivation: 研究中子星内部结构，探索BECS模型是否与观测数据兼容。

Method: 利用GW170817、XMMU J173203.3-344518等天文数据及中子星核心热容下限，分析BECS模型的散射长度$a$范围。

Result: 若GW170817涉及BECS，散射长度$a$应在4-10 fm；$a\sim3.1-4$ fm时，可匹配XMMU J173203.3-344518的质量和半径；热容在$a>2-5$ fm时超过下限。

Conclusion: 支持$a\sim4$ fm的BECS模型，与多种观测数据一致，有助于理解中子星内部。

Abstract: We evaluate the feasibility of Bose-Einstein condensate stars (BECS) as
models for the interior of neutron stars. BECS are compact objects composed of
bosons, formed through the spin-parallel pairing of neutrons. Here, we utilize
the astronomical data from GW170817, XMMU J173203.3-344518 (the lightest
neutron star known), and a novel lower limit on neutron star core heat capacity
to scrutinize the compatibility of BECS with these recent observations of
neutron stars. Our specific focus is to constrain the values of the scattering
length $a$, a parameter determining the strength of particle interactions in
the model. Our analysis suggests that if the stars involved in GW170817 were
BECSs, the scattering length of their constituent bosons should fall within the
$4$ to $10$ fm range. Additionally, at a scattering length of $a\sim 3.1-4$ fm,
stars with mass and radius characteristics akin to XMMU J173203.3-344518 are
identified. Moreover, we find that the heat capacity depends of the mass and
temperature of BECS, and surpasses the established lower bound for neutron star
cores when $a>2-5$ fm. In summary, our results endorse BECS models with $a\sim
4$ fm, providing neutron star observables in robust agreement with diverse
observations and contributing to the ongoing understanding of neutron star
interiors.

Abstract: The detection of extensive air showers using radio antennas has evolved into
a mature technique, complementing particle detector arrays by providing
sensitivity to the longitudinal development of the showers and enabling an
independent determination of the cosmic-ray energy. Both the Pierre Auger
Observatory in Argentina and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole
have been undergoing upgrades, including the integration of radio antennas. The
next-generation neutrino detector IceCube-Gen2 will also feature a surface
array for PeV-EeV cosmic-ray detection, consisting of scintillation detectors
and radio antennas. Prototype stations for this upgrade have been in operation
for several years at both, the South Pole and the Auger Observatory, enabling
cross-checks and potentially a cross-calibration of the energy scales between
the two experiments. In this contribution, we present an analysis of air
showers observed with the radio antennas of the IceCube-Gen2 prototype station,
coinciding with detections by the water-Cherenkov detectors of the densest part
of the Pierre Auger Observatory's surface array, featuring a 433 m spacing.

Abstract: We present an analysis of the correlation between the depth of the maximum of
air-shower profiles and the signal in water-Cherenkov stations in events
registered simultaneously by the fluorescence and surface detectors of the
Pierre Auger Observatory. The analysis enables us to place constraints on the
spread of nuclear masses in ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with a minor impact
from the experimental systematic uncertainties and uncertainties in air-shower
simulations. Due to this unique feature, the correlation analysis has
previously allowed us to exclude all pure and proton-helium compositions near
the ankle in the cosmic-ray energy spectrum at 5$\sigma$ confidence level. The
same property makes the correlation analysis an effective tool for testing the
consistency of predictions of the post-LHC hadronic interaction models,
including their latest versions such as EPOS LHC-R, QGSJet-III-01,
Sibyll${}^\bigstar$ and Sibyll 2.3e. In this work, the correlation analysis
using the Phase I hybrid data from the Pierre Auger Observatory is presented.
The analysis uses the newest generation of hadronic interaction models and
covers an extended energy range around the ankle in the cosmic-ray spectrum.

Result: 光曲线持续上升，峰值光度达10^40 erg/s，提出了两种可能的物理场景：延迟球状外流或高度离轴相对论喷流。

Conclusion: 未来射电观测和VLBI数据可进一步区分这两种场景。

Abstract: We present ongoing radio observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE)
AT2018hyz, which was first detected in the radio at 972 days after disruption,
following multiple non-detections from earlier searches. The new observations
presented here span approximately 1370-2160 days and 0.88-240 GHz. We find that
the light curves continue to rise at all frequencies during this time period,
following a power law of about F ~ t^3 (compared to F_nu ~ t^5.7 at 972-1400
days), and reaching a peak luminosity of L~ 10^40 erg/s, comparable to the
luminosity of the relativistic TDE Swift 1644+57 on the same timescale. The
multi-frequency data indicate that the peak frequency does not significantly
evolve over the 1030-day span of our observations, while the peak flux density
increases by an order of magnitude. The observed behavior is consistent with
two possible scenarios: (i) a delayed spherical outflow launched about 620 days
post-disruption with a velocity of ~0.3c and an energy of ~10^50 erg, and (ii)
a highly off-axis (~80-90 deg) relativistic jet with a Lorentz factor of Gamma
~8 and E_K ~ 10^52 erg. Continued radio observations to capture the light curve
peak, as well as VLBI observations, could distinguish between these scenarios.

Conclusion: 研究支持火球模型，揭示了GRB余辉的磁场起源和环境特征。

Abstract: Afterglows of GRBs are, in general, well described by the fireball model.
Yet, deducing the full set of model parameters from observations without prior
assumptions has been possible for only a handful of GRBs. With GROND, a
7-channel simultaneous optical and near-infrared imager at the 2.2m telescope
of the Max-Planck Society at ESO/La Silla, a dedicated gamma-ray burst (GRB)
afterglow observing program was performed between 2007 and 2016.
  Here, we combine GROND observations of four particularly well-sampled GRBs
with public Swift/XRT data and partly own sub-mm and radio data to determine
the basic fireball afterglow parameters.
  We find that all four bursts exploded into a wind environment. We are able to
infer the evolution of the magnetic field strength from our data, and find
evidence for its origin through shock amplification of the magnetic field of
the circumburst medium.

Abstract: In recent years, the existence of a gap in the mass spectrum of compact
objects formed from stellar collapse, between the heaviest neutron stars and
the lightest black holes, has been a matter of significant debate. The presence
or absence of a mass gap has implications for the supernova mechanism, as well
as being a fundamental property of the compact object mass function. In X-ray
binaries containing black holes a gap is observed, but it is not known whether
this is representative of a true gap in the mass function or due to selection
effects or systematic biases in mass estimation. Binary black hole mergers
detected from gravitational waves in the GWTC-3 transient catalog furnish a
large sample of several tens of low-mass black holes with a well-understood
selection function. Here we analyze the \nevts{} GWTC-3 merger events (along
with GW230529\_181500) with at least one black hole ($3 \, M_\odot < m_1$) and
chirp masses below those of a $20\,M_\odot$--$20\,M_\odot$ merger ($\mathcal{M}
< 17.41 M_{\odot}$) to uncover the structure of the low-mass black hole mass
function. Using flexible parameterized models for the mass function, we find,
similar to existing studies, a sharp peak in the mass function at $m \simeq
(8-10 M_{\odot})$. We observe a steady decline in the merger rate to lower
masses, but by less than an order of magnitude in total, and find that the
first percentile of black hole masses in our most flexible model is $m_{1\%}
=3.13^{+0.18}_{-0.04}$. In other words, this sample of low-mass black holes is
not consistent with the existence of a mass gap.

Abstract: The hottest, most ionized, and fastest winds driven by accretion onto massive
black holes have the potential to reshape their host galaxies.
Calorimeter-resolution X-ray spectroscopy is the ideal tool to understand this
feedback mode, as it enables accurate estimates of physical characteristics
needed to determine the wind's kinetic power. We report on a photoionization
analysis of five observations of the Seyfert-1.5 galaxy NGC 4151, obtained with
XRISM/Resolve in 2023 and 2024. In the Fe K band, individual spectra require as
many as six wind absorption components. Slow "warm absorbers" (WAs,
$v_{\mathrm{out}} \sim 100 - 1000~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$), very fast outflows
(VFOs, $v_{\mathrm{out}} \sim 10^3~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1} - 10^4~{\rm km}~{\rm
s}^{-1}$), and ultra-fast outflows (UFOs, $v_{\mathrm{out}} \sim 10^4~{\rm
km}~{\rm s}^{-1} - 10^5~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ or $0.033 - 0.33~c$) are
detected simultaneously, and indicate a stratified, multiphase wind. Fast and
variable emission components suggest that the wind is axially asymmetric. All
of the wind components have mass flow rates comparable to or in excess of the
mass accretion rate, though the slowest zones may be "failed" winds that do not
escape. Two UFO components have kinetic luminosities that exceed the
theoretical threshold of $L_{kin} \geq 0.5\% L_{Edd}$ necessary to strip the
host bulge of gas and halt star formation, even after corrections for plausible
filling factors. The bulk properties of the observed winds are consistent with
magnetocentrifugal driving, where the density depends on radius as $n \propto
r^{-1.5}$, but radiative driving and other mechanisms may also be important.
Numerous complexities and variability require further analysis.

Motivation: 研究Dainotti关系的物理机制，以解释GRB X射线余辉中平台期的多样性与标准化问题。

Method: 提出多极磁场模型，分析238个GRB样本的平台期数据，验证其与Dainotti关系的吻合度。

Result: 多极磁场模型能解释平台期能量范围和Dainotti关系的斜率（b=-1），且与观测数据一致。

Conclusion: 多极磁场为Dainotti关系提供了统一解释，支持GRB作为宇宙学探针的潜力。

Abstract: The Dainotti relation empirically connects the isotropic plateau luminosity
($L_X$) in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) X-ray afterglows to the rest-frame time at
which the plateau ends ($T_a^*$), enabling both the standardization of GRBs and
their use as cosmological probes. However, the precise physical mechanisms
underlying this correlation remain an active area of research. Although
magnetars, highly magnetized neutron stars, have been proposed as central
engines powering GRB afterglows, traditional dipole spin-down radiation models
fail to account for the full diversity of observed behaviors. This limitation
necessitates a more comprehensive framework. We propose that multipolar
magnetic field emissions from magnetars offer a plausible explanation for the
Dainotti relation. Unlike simple dipole fields, higher-order multipolar
configurations enable more complex energy dissipation processes. The
coexistence of multiple components can plausibly explain the range of afterglow
decay indices found from a sample of 238 GRBs with plateau features from the
Swift-XRT database up to the end of December 2024, the majority of which
deviate from the dipolar prediction of $\alpha = -2$, and more crucially, the
spin-down physics yields a link between $L_X$ and $T_a^*$ in a way that
preserves the Dainotti correlation with a slope of $b = - 1$, independent of
the specific multipole order. Moreover, we find that the inclusion of higher
order multipoles can explain the range of plateau energies found in the
Dainotti relations. Thus, a unified picture emerges in which multipolar fields
are able to reproduce both the slope and the normalization of the correlation.

Abstract: Central compact objects (CCOs) are a subclass of neutron stars with a dipole
magnetic field strength considerably weaker than those of radio pulsars and
magnetars. One possible explanation for such weak magnetic fields in the CCOs
is the hidden magnetic field scenario, in which supernova fallback submerges
the magnetosphere of a proto-neutron star beneath a newly formed crust.
However, the fallback mass and timescale required for this submergence process
remain uncertain. We perform one-dimensional general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the supernova fallback onto a magnetized
proto-neutron star, while considering neutrino cooling. In our simulations, the
infalling material compresses the magnetic field and drives a strong shock. The
shock initially expands outward, but eventually stalls and recedes as neutrino
cooling becomes significant. After the shock stalls, the gas density above the
magnetosphere increases rapidly, potentially leading to the formation of a new
crust. To understand the shock dynamics, we develop semi-analytic models that
describe the resulting magnetospheric and shock radii when the shock stalls. By
comparing the fallback time scale with the shock stalling time scale,
corresponding to the waiting time for the new crust formation, we derive a
necessary condition for the submergence of the PNS magnetic field. Our results
will provide guidance for investigating the diversity of young isolated neutron
stars through multidimensional simulations.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了中微子在致密天体环境中的快速味转换（FFCs），并利用可解释机器学习框架（KANs和SINDy）从模拟数据中提取物理洞察。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速味转换的模拟需要大量计算资源且难以提取直接物理洞察，机器学习方法虽能预测结果但缺乏解释性。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)和Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy)两种可解释机器学习框架分析FFC模拟数据。

Result: KANs在重建中微子能谱时准确率达90%，而SINDy提供了简洁的支配方程但精度较低。研究发现重轻子中微子数密度是系统演化的主导因素。

Conclusion: 研究为天文学和天体物理学提供了支持数据驱动物理发现的可解释机器学习框架。

Abstract: Neutrinos can experience fast flavor conversions (FFCs) in highly dense
astrophysical environments, such as core-collapse supernovae and neutron star
mergers, potentially affecting energy transport and other processes. The
simulation of fast flavor conversions under realistic astrophysical conditions
requires substantial computational resources and involves significant
analytical challenges. While machine learning methods like Multilayer
Perceptrons have been used to accurately predict the asymptotic outcomes of
FFCs, their 'black-box' nature limits the extraction of direct physical
insight. To address this limitation, we employ two distinct interpretable
machine learning frameworks-Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and Sparse
Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy)-to derive physically insightful
models from a FFC simulation dataset. Our analysis reveals a fundamental
trade-off between predictive accuracy and model simplicity. The KANs
demonstrates high fidelity in reconstructing post-conversion neutrino energy
spectra, achieving accuracies of up to $90\%$. In contrast, SINDy uncovers a
remarkably concise, low-rank set of governing equations, offering maximum
interpretability but with lower predictive accuracy. Critically, by analyzing
the interpretable model, we identify the number density of heavy-lepton
neutrinos as the most dominant factor in the system's evolution. Ultimately,
this work provides a methodological framework for interpretable machine
learning that supports genuine data-driven physical discovery in astronomy and
astrophysics, going beyond prediction alone.

Result: 展示了最新的分析灵敏度，并与之前测量结果进行了比较。

Conclusion: 该分析为地球密度和质量提供了一种基于弱力的非引力测量方法，具有重要科学意义。

Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has observed a sample of high purity,
primarily atmospheric, muon neutrino events over 11 years from all directions
below the horizon, spanning the energy range 500 GeV to 100 TeV. While this
sample was initially used for an eV-scale sterile neutrino search, its purity
and spanned parameter space can also be used to perform an earth tomography.
This flux of neutrinos traverses the earth and is attenuated in varying amounts
depending on the energy and traversed column density of the event. By
parameterizing the earth as multiple constant--density shells, IceCube can
measure the upgoing neutrino flux as a function of the declination, yielding an
inference of the density of each shell. In this talk, the latest sensitivities
of this analysis and comparisons with the previous measurement are presented.
In addition, the analysis procedure, details about the data sample, and
systematic effects are also explained. This analysis is one of the latest,
weak-force driven, non-gravitational, measurements of the earth's density and
mass.

Abstract: Understanding where elements were formed has been a key goal in astrophysics
for nearly a century, with answers involving cosmology, stellar burning, and
cosmic explosions. Since 1957, the origin of the heaviest elements (formed via
the rapid neutron capture process; r-process) has remained a mystery,
identified as a key question to answer this century by the US National Research
Council. With the advent of gravitational wave astronomy and recent
measurements by the James Webb Space Telescope we now know that neutron star
mergers are a key site of heavy element nucleosynthesis. We must now understand
the heavy element yield of these events as well as mapping when these mergers
occurred back through cosmic time, currently thought to peak when the universe
was half its current age. This requires an extremely sensitive ultraviolet,
optical, and infrared telescope which can respond rapidly to external
discoveries of neutron star mergers. We here describe how the Habitable Worlds
Observatory can provide the first complete answer to one of the questions of
the century.

Method: 结合荧光和地面探测器的数据，分析$X_\text{max}$和地面信号的预测与实测差异，调整模型参数。

Result: 模型预测的$X_\text{max}$尺度需加深，暗示更重的质量组成；模型参数需调整以匹配数据。

Conclusion: 当前强子相互作用模型需修正以更准确描述实测数据，这对宇宙射线研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: The combined data of Fluorescence and Surface Detectors of the Pierre Auger
Observatory has recently provided the strongest constraints on the validity of
predictions from current models of hadronic interactions. The unmodified
predictions of these models on the depth of shower maximum ($X_\text{max}$) and
the hadronic part of the ground signal are unable to accurately describe the
measured data at a level of more than 5$\sigma$ in the energy range 3-10 EeV.
This inconsistency has been shown to originate not only from the predicted
amount of muons at the ground level, but also from the predicted scale of
$X_\text{max}$, which must be adjusted to better match the observed data. The
resulting deeper $X_\text{max}$ scales of the models imply a heavier mass
composition to be interpreted from the $X_\text{max}$ measurements. We show the
results of the test with an updated data set of the Pierre Auger Observatory,
studying also the energy evolution of the fitted modification parameters and
new versions of the models of hadronic interactions. Additionally, we discuss
the phenomenological consequences of the deeper $X_\text{max}$ scale of models
on the interpretation of the features of the energy spectrum and the muon
problem in air-shower modelling.

Conclusion: 该模型不仅解释了SN2022jli的观测特征，还可推广到其他类似超新星，并探讨了系统的未来演化与现有中子星双星的联系。

Abstract: We present 3D hydrodynamical modelling of supernova-induced
binary-interaction-powered supernovae; a scenario proposed for the peculiar
type Ic supernova SN2022jli. In this scenario, supernova ejecta of a
stripped-envelope star impacts a close-by stellar companion, temporarily
inflating the envelope. The expanded envelope engulfs the neutron star, causing
strong mass accretion at super-Eddington rates. Feedback from the accretion
powers the supernova light curve with periodic undulations. Our simulations
capture key features of SN2022jli, both the overall decline and the
superimposed undulations of the light curve. Based on our parameter study, we
find that (i) the accretion feedback should be sufficiently geometrically
confined and the eccentricity of the post-supernova binary orbit should be
$0.7\lesssim e\lesssim0.9$ to sustain a high accretion rate, and (ii) the
viewing angle should be close to edge-on to match the low undulation amplitude
($\Delta L/L\sim0.1$) of SN2022jli. Different combinations of parameters could
account for other supernovae like SN2022mop, SN2009ip and SN2015ap. We also
discuss possible explanations for other key features of SN2022jli such as the
$\gamma$-ray detection at $\sim200~\mathrm{d}$ and the rapid optical drop at
$\sim250~\mathrm{d}$. Finally, we speculate on the future evolution of the
system and its relation to existing neutron star binaries.

Motivation: 研究中子星内部是否存在一阶强子-夸克相变（FOPT），并探讨如何通过改进的观测直接测试这种相变。

Method: 采用非参数高斯过程（GP）EOS框架，结合最新观测数据（如NICER对PSR J0614--3329的半径测量），并显式包含一阶相变。

Result: 贝叶斯因子B≈2.3，微弱支持相变存在；相变起始密度n_PT在68%置信度下低于2n_s或高于4n_s；低密度下的对称能斜率参数L与核实验值一致。

Conclusion: 研究微弱支持中子星内部存在一阶强子-夸克相变，并揭示了相变密度与对称能斜率参数L的关联。

Abstract: The possible occurrence of a first-order hadron-quark phase transition (FOPT)
in neutron-star interiors remains an open question. Whether such a transition
can be directly tested with improved observations is a key challenge. Here, we
incorporate the latest constraints, especially a new NICER radius measurement
for PSR J0614--3329, into a nonparametric Gaussian Process (GP) EOS framework
that explicitly includes a first-order transition. We find a Bayes factor of
$B\approx2.3$ when comparing models with and without an explicit phase
transition, marginally favoring its presence. At $68\%$ credibility, the
transition onset density $n_{\rm PT}$ is either below $2\,n_s$ (corresponding
to masses $\lesssim1\,M_\odot$, with density jump $\Delta n\sim0.5\,n_s$) or,
more prominently, above $4\,n_s$ (near the central density of the heaviest NS,
with $\Delta n\sim3\,n_s$), where $n_s$ represents the nuclear saturation
density. In addition, by using symmetry-energy expansion at low densities
($<1.1\,n_s$), we infer a slope parameter $L=40.2^{+19.3}_{-14.3}$ MeV, in good
agreement with nuclear-experiment values. Intriguingly, $L$ correlates
positively with the radius difference between $1.4\,M_\odot$ and $2.0\,M_\odot$
stars.

Motivation: AGN盘的密集环境可能影响恒星形成、演化和迁移，进而导致CCSNe爆炸的各向异性。

Method: 构建平衡方程，考虑压力梯度和迁移加速度，计算不同类型前身星在不同AGN盘位置的CCSNe光变曲线。

Result: 迁移加速度对爆炸各向异性影响显著，大半径处各向异性光度明显，超大质量黑洞（SMBH）会抑制各向异性并降低总光度。

Conclusion: AGN盘中的迁移加速度是影响CCSNe各向异性的主要因素，SMBH质量对光度和各向异性有显著调控作用。

Abstract: Active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk provide dense environments to influence on
the star formation, evolution, and migration. In AGN disks, pressure gradients
and migration accelerations could create the anisotropy of the core-collapse
supernovae (CCSNe) when the massive stars explode at the end of their lives. In
this study, we construct the equilibrium equations by considering the above two
factors and then compute the light curves for three types of progenitor stars
at different locations of AGN disks for the different supermassive black hole
(SMBH) masses, accretion efficiencies, explosion energies, and masses of
ejecta. The results show that the migration acceleration has more significant
effects on the anisotropic explosions than the pressure gradients of the AGN
disks. The anisotropic luminosities are pronounced at large radii, and massive
SMBHs would suppress the anisotropy and reduce the total luminosity.

Abstract: The Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) observatory continues to operate
successfully in orbit at the Lagrange point L2. The Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC
telescope has demonstrated high efficiency in conducting X-ray surveys both
over large sky regions and the entire celestial sphere. A recently published
source catalog, based on data from the first four and partially completed fifth
sky scans, contains 1,545 objects detected in the 4-12 keV energy range. In
this work, using the same sky survey data, we assess the sensitivity to point
source detection across the celestial sphere based on X-ray aperture photometry
- that is, we calculate the upper flux limit in the 4-12 keV band at any given
significance level. The method is implemented using both Poisson statistics and
Bayesian inference, with consistent results between the two approaches. This
information is important for studying variable and transient X-ray sources, as
well as sources that are not detected with sufficient statistical significance
in the ART-XC all-sky survey. The ART-XC upper limit service is available at

Abstract: We report on a quasi-periodic variation at $\sim1$ Hz during a fast X-ray
outburst of a high-mass X-ray binary MAXI J0709$-$159 / LY CMa observed by the
Neutron-star interior composition explorer (NICER). The new X-ray transient
MAXI J0709$-$159 was discovered on 2022 January 25. Due to the transient X-ray
behavior characterized by the short (a few hours) outburst duration, rapid
($\lesssim$ 1 s) variability with spectral change, and large luminosity swing
from $10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to $10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$, the object was
considered likely to be a supergiant X-ray binary with a neutron star (NS)
categorized as a Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient (SFXT). Follow-up NICER and
NuSTAR observations confirmed that the position of the new X-ray object is
consistent with a Be star, LY CMa, which has been also identified as a B
supergiant. We analyzed the NICER data obtained from 3 hours to 6 days after
the discovery. The light curve reveals that the X-ray activity continued for
$\sim7$ hours in sparse short flares, each lasting $\lesssim 100$ seconds, and
the luminosity instantaneously reached up to $\sim 1\times 10^{38}$ erg
s$^{-1}$. The light-curve and spectral features reasonably agree with those
expected from accretion of a clumpy stellar-wind onto a magnetized NS. The
variability power spectrum during the brightest flare shows a broad peak at
$1.1$ Hz resembling a quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO). If the QPO is
attributed to the Keplerian orbital frequency at the inner edge of a transient
accretion disk truncated by the NS magnetosphere, the NS surface magnetic field
is estimated to be $\sim 10^{12}$ G.

Abstract: Millisecond pulsars are known to show complex radio pulse profiles and
polarisation position angle evolution with rotational phase. Small scale
surface magnetic fields and multipolar components are believed to be
responsible for this complexity due to the radiation mechanisms occurring close
to the stellar surface but within the relatively small light-cylinder compared
to the stellar radius. In this work, we use the latest NICER phase aligned
thermal X-ray pulse profile of PSR~J0740+6620 combined with radio and
$\gamma$-ray pulse profiles and radio polarisation to deduce the best magnetic
field configuration that can simultaneously reproduce the light-curves in these
respective bands. We assume a polar cap model for the radio emission and use
the rotating vector model for the associated polarisation, a striped wind model
for the $\gamma$-ray light-curves and rely on the NICER collaboration results
for the hot spot geometry. We demonstrate that an almost centred dipole can
account for the hot spot location with a magnetic obliquity of $\alpha \approx
51 \deg$ and a line of sight inclination angle of $\zeta \approx 82 \deg$.
However, with this geometry, the hot spot areas are three times too large. We
found a better solution consisting of two dipoles located just below the
surface in approximately antipodal positions. Our double dipole model is able
to reproduce all the salient radio and $\gamma$-ray characteristics of
PSR~J0740+6620 including radio polarisation data. A double dipole solution is
more flexible than an off-centred dipole because of two independent magnetic
axes and could hint at a magnetic field mostly concentrated within the crust
and not in the core.

Conclusion: 改进的触发器和搜索方法显著提升了Pierre Auger Observatory的中微子探测能力。

Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory has the capability to identify neutrino-induced
extensive air showers above $10^{17}$ eV by using its large Surface Detector
(SD) array. Data from the Observatory have been used to set some of the most
stringent upper limits to the neutrino flux in the ultra-high energy (UHE)
range. The data have also been used for follow-up detection of transient events
in the context of multi-messenger astrophysics. In mid-2013, two additional SD
triggers (Time-over-Threshold-deconvolved (ToTd) and Multiplicity-of-Positive
Steps (MoPS)) were shown to increase the detection capability for the
neutrino-induced air showers in the energy regime below $10^{19}$ eV by a
factor of 5-10. This contribution will give an overview of the ongoing work
regarding the searches for UHE neutrinos at the Pierre Auger Observatory. The
impact of the ToTd and MoPS triggers for neutrino search in the zenith angle
range of $60^{\circ} < \theta < 75^{\circ}$ is discussed. A novel neutrino
identification method, which integrates these triggers, is applied to
observational data to look for neutrino-like events using a $\textit{blind}$
search strategy. New constraints to point-like sources of UHE neutrinos will be
presented for the angular range explored.

Abstract: Pulsars, the cosmic lighthouses, are strongly self-gravitating objects with
core densities significantly exceeding nuclear density. Since the discovery of
the Hulse--Taylor pulsar 50 years ago, binary pulsar studies have delivered
numerous stringent tests of General Relativity (GR) in the strong-field regime
as well as its radiative properties -- gravitational waves (GWs). These systems
also enable high-precision neutron star mass measurements, placing tight
constraints on the behaviour of matter at extreme densities. In addition,
pulsars act as natural detectors for nanohertz GWs, primarily from supermassive
black hole binaries, culminating in the first reported evidence of a stochastic
GW background in 2023. In this article, I review key milestones in pulsar
research and highlight some of contributions from my own work. After a brief
overview of the gravity experiments in \S 1, I review the discovery of pulsars
-- particularly those in binaries -- and their critical role in gravity
experiments (\S 2) that laid the foundation for recent advances. In \S 3, I
present the latest efforts on GR tests using the Double Pulsar and a pioneer
technique to constrain the dense matter equation of state. \S 4 demonstrates
the potential of binary pulsars on testing alternative theories to GR. Advances
in nanohertz GW detection with pulsar timing arrays are discussed in \S 5. I
outline some of the current challenges in \S 6 and conclude with final remarks
in \S 7.

### [39] [Numerical simulations of jet launching and breakout from collapsars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10231)
*Gerardo Urrutia,Agnieszka Janiuk,Hector Olivares*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文研究了GRB（伽马射线暴）喷流的产生和演化，通过2.5维GRMHD模拟，发现强偶极磁场是成功发射相对论性喷流的关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟GRB从产生到喷流突破星体包层的全过程计算成本高，因此研究聚焦于黑洞视界附近的喷流产生及其后续演化。

Method: 采用2.5维GRMHD模拟，初始条件为Wolf-Rayet星模型和MESA代码演化的长GRB前身星，并施加偶极磁场以探索其影响。

Result: 喷流以磁主导为主，热和动能成分在传播过程中保持相当。成功发射喷流需强偶极磁场和高速自旋（a=0.9），否则喷流停滞。喷流突破时间为1.5-3.5秒，光度为10^49-10^53 erg/s。

Conclusion: 强偶极磁场驱动的磁滞盘是成功发射相对论性喷流的关键，磁场分布和前身星分层决定了喷流结构和成功与否。

Abstract: Simulate the entire GRB dynamics since its production until the jet's
break-out from the star envelope is computationally expensive. In this work, we
aim to investigate jet production at the black hole horizon and its subsequent
evolution beyond the envelope boundary. We perform 2.5-dimensional GRMHD
simulations using, as initial conditions, remapped massive star progenitors
previously evolved with a state-of-the-art stellar evolutionary codes.
Specifically, we adopt the Wolf-Rayet star models 12TH and 16TI from the
Woosley \& Heger framework, and we evolve our own Long GRB progenitor with the
MESA code. A dipolar magnetic field is imposed, with variations in field
strength to explore its influence. We find that the jets are magnetically
dominated, with their thermal and kinetic components remaining comparable
during propagation through the stellar envelope. The cocoon is thermally
dominated in most cases. Jet launching is successful when the magnetic field
has a dipolar configuration and spin $a=0.9$, in contrast, a hybrid magnetic
field does not result in jet formation. We observe disk formation in cases
without a magnetized jet, however, the formation of a well-defined funnel is
not evident and the expansion of such wind does not break the star for longer
times. Our simulations show that a collapsar launches a successful,
relativistic jet only when a strong, large-scale dipolar field, driving a
magnetically arrested disk. Such jets collimate, accelerate, and break out of
progenitor stars in $1.5\lesssim t\lesssim3.5$ s, while weaker or
non-magnetised flows stall inside the star. The resulting jets have
luminosities of $L_{j}\sim10^{49}$--$10^{53}\,$erg\,s$^{-1}$ and the final
energy structure reveals that magnetisation distribution and progenitor
stratification as the key determinants of jet structure and success.

TL;DR: Pierre Auger Observatory从Phase I升级到Phase II，增加了新的探测器和技术，用于更精确测量超高能宇宙射线（UHECRs）。软件框架Offline也在持续更新，支持数据分析和模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更精确地测量和识别超高能宇宙射线的来源，以及改进空气簇射的测量方法。

Method: 升级了水切伦科夫探测器（WCDs），增加了表面闪烁体探测器、无线电探测器、小型光电倍增管和升级的电子板，并引入地下μ子探测器。使用Offline软件框架进行事件重建和模拟。

Result: Phase II的升级提供了更高质量的数据，支持更精确的UHECRs源识别和空气簇射测量。

Conclusion: Pierre Auger Observatory的升级和软件更新显著提升了UHECRs研究的精确性和效率。

Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory consists of 1660 water-Cherenkov detectors
(WCDs) and 27 fluorescence telescopes, covering a surface of 3000 km2 in the
province of Mendoza, Argentina. After almost two decades, Auger Phase I has
ended the data taking and has already delivered many outstanding physics
results. The Auger Observatory is currently running in Phase II, with upgraded
detectors for enhanced data of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). During
Phase I, several engineering detectors were developed and tested. Some of those
developments led to new detectors, which are now part of the upgraded
Observatory. For Phase II, the WCDs were upgraded with a surface-scintillator
detector, a radio detector, a small photomultiplier, and an upgraded
electronics board, facilitating mass-sensitive measurements for source
identification of UHECRs. Moreover, an underground muon detector allows for a
direct measurement of the muon content of air showers. The Offline framework is
the main software for the event reconstruction and detector simulation at the
Pierre Auger Observatory. It is continuously being developed to accommodate
changes in the detector and new algorithms. It allows the running of various
applications, which are made up of individual modules, either on raw data or
simulations on an event-by-event basis. Large productions of shower and
detector reference libraries are done with CORSIKA 7 and Offline on the
European Grid Infrastructure (EGI) using the Virtual Organization Auger.
Various air-shower geometries (up to 89 degrees in zenith) were considered, as
well as several primary particles (from light to ultra-heavy nuclei, photons,
and neutrinos), hadronic interaction models and detector configurations for
Phase I and Phase II. In this contribution, we present the actual efforts and
updates on software for data production and reference Monte Carlo simulations
for Auger data analysis.

### [41] [A Method for Testing Diffusive Shock Acceleration and Diffusion Propagation of 1-100 TeV Cosmic Electron with Multi-wavelength Observation of Geminga Halo and Pulsar Wind Nebula](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10276)
*Weikang Gao,Li-Zhuo Bao,Kun Fang,En-sheng Chen,Siming Liu,HongBo Hu*

TL;DR: 论文通过Geminga区域的HAWC和Fermi-LAT数据测试了扩散激波加速和扩散传播模型，结果与理论一致，但需更高精度数据验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接验证扩散激波加速和扩散传播理论在高能宇宙射线中的有效性，填补从MeV到sub-PeV能量的理论测试空白。

Method: 利用HAWC和Fermi-LAT的最新光谱和形态数据，开发方法测试1至数百TeV能量范围内的理论模型。

Result: 理论与实验观测一致，但当前形态数据能量区间较宽，无法高精度验证能量依赖扩散系数。

Conclusion: 未来HAWC和LHAASO-KM2A的高精度观测有望进一步验证理论，尤其是100 TeV以上扩散系数的快速增加。

Abstract: Diffusive shock acceleration and diffusion propagation are essential
components of the standard cosmic ray model. These theories are based on
extensive observations of high-energy solar processes, providing substantial
direct evidence in the MeV energy range. Although the model is widely and
successfully used to explain high-energy cosmic phenomena, direct validation
has been elusive. The multi-wavelength spectra and angular profile measurements
of the Geminga pulsar wind nebula and its pulsar halo, particularly the precise
spectral observations by HAWC and LHAASO-KM2A in recent years, offer a rare
opportunity to test these theories with cosmic rays energies between 1 TeV and
several hundred TeV. These observations are expected to elevate the direct
testing of theoretical models from multi-MeV to sub-PeV energies. In this work,
a method is developed to test the diffusive shock acceleration and diffusion
propagation model between one and several hundred TeV energies through the
latest spectral and morphological data of the Geminga region from HAWC and
Fermi-LAT. Our results show that the theories of diffusive shock acceleration
and diffusion propagation are consistent with experimental observations.
However, the published morphological data adopted rather wide energy bins and
currently do not allow a high precision test of the inferred energy dependent
diffusion coefficient by observed energy spectra with DSA theory. It is
anticipated that future HAWC and LHAASO-KM2A observations will yield
higher-precision results, and the confirmation of a rapidly increasing
diffusion coefficient above 100 TeV would serve as important evidence
supporting the diffusive shock acceleration and diffusion propagation theory.

Method: 利用表面、荧光和无线电探测器数据，分析UHECR的$X_{\rm max}$和μ子含量等可观测指标。

Result: 数据表明UHECR质量组成复杂，不支持质子主导模型，且观测到的通量特征不能仅用质子传播效应解释。

Conclusion: 研究为UHECR质量组成提供了更清晰的图景，并探讨了其随赤纬变化的可能性。

Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory has driven the field of ultra-high-energy cosmic
ray (UHECR) physics, producing several groundbreaking observations over the
last 20 years. One of the most striking findings has been the complex evolution
of UHECR mass composition, as revealed by detailed analyses of observables such
as the depth of shower maximum ($X_{\rm max}$) and the muon content of showers.
As more data are collected and sophisticated analyses are undertaken, not only
are new fine details emerging, but the general picture of UHECR mass
composition is becoming increasingly robust. This contribution presents recent
results on the mass composition of UHECRs derived from surface, fluorescence,
and radio detectors. Together with other key findings from the Observatory,
these results converge to present a coherent picture of UHECR mass composition,
effectively ruling out proton dominance and challenging the interpretation of
the observed flux features as purely proton-induced propagation effects. To
finish the contribution, we compare the $X_{\rm max}$ data from the southern
and northern equatorial bands of the exposure of the Pierre Auger Observatory
fluorescence detector to evaluate the possibility of changes in composition as
a function of declination.

### [43] [Study of solar activity with AERA at the Pierre Auger Observatory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10297)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究分析了太阳活动对AERA数据的影响，揭示了太阳活动与无线电波传播之间的复杂关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太阳活动释放的能量会影响地球电离层，进而影响无线电通信和宇宙射线探测，研究旨在量化这种影响。

Method: 利用AERA收集的11年数据，分析太阳活动对30-80 MHz频段的影响，并与e-CALLISTO和SWAVES的独立观测进行对比。

Result: 发现MUF与30-40 MHz频段的宽带噪声显著相关，并观测到与NOAA报告的无线电中断一致的现象。

Conclusion: 太阳活动与无线电波传播的相互作用对宇宙射线探测有重要影响。

Abstract: Solar activity events release vast amounts of energy, including radio waves,
X-rays, ultraviolet radiation, and energetic particles, which interact with the
ionosphere of the Earth and can disrupt radio wave propagation, affecting radio
communications. They can either enhance reflections, improving long-distance
terrestrial communications, or cause signal degradation and absorption,
respectively, depending on whether the increased ionization affects the upper
or lower layers of the ionosphere. In the first case, the solar cycle modulates
the Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF), the highest frequency usable for radio
communication between two Earth-based points. The Auger Engineering Radio Array
(AERA) of the Pierre Auger Observatory was developed to measure the radio
emission from extensive air showers in the $30-80$ MHz band. We examine the
impact of solar activity on AERA data collected over approximately 11 years. We
report the detection of different types of solar radio bursts and we
investigate how increased solar radiation - particularly in the X-ray and
extreme ultraviolet bands - also affects measurements in the AERA energy band.
Our results show a remarkable correlation between the MUF and the broadband
noise observed in the $30-40$ MHz frequency range. Radio blackouts are also
observed in AERA spectrograms in coincidence with those reported by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Additionally, we
performed a search for temporal coincidences between AERA data and independent
observations of solar radio burst events from the e-CALLISTO network and the
SWAVES instrument. These findings highlight the complex interplay between solar
activity and radio wave propagation, which is also relevant for cosmic-ray
detection.

Motivation: 现有方法计算耗时且可能遗漏微弱源，需要手动添加，因此需要一种更高效的方法来减少计算资源消耗。

Method: 使用threeML软件包和HAL插件进行似然性分析，结合种子源位置的方法来优化搜索。

Result: 现有方法需要多天完成建模，且可能遗漏微弱源；优化方法有望显著减少计算时间和资源。

Conclusion: 通过引入种子源位置的方法，可以显著提高搜索效率并减少计算资源消耗。

Abstract: The analysis of HAWC data is done using a likeihood-based systematic
multi-source search procedure utilizing the threeML software package and the
HAL Plugin. This approach was inspired by the extended source search described
in the Fermi-LAT Extended Source Search Catalog. The pipeline to search for
point sources and extended sources within the region of interest (ROI) is
described in the recent HAWC papers. This procedure is computationally
intensive and often requires multiple days to produce a final model for a
region. Often this approach misses fainter sources, which need to be added
manually later. This blind search could be complemented by providing a method
to seed source locations, which can be assessed and evaluated by likelihood
analysis, thereby significantly reducing the computational time and resources
spent on finding a model.

Method: 通过分析中子星的质量-半径关系R(M)和潮汐形变能力λ(M)的二阶导数，识别超子的特征。

Result: 超子存在会导致质量-半径关系的负曲率增加，以及潮汐形变能力的二阶导数减小。

Conclusion: 这些特征可用于区分中子星物质中是否包含超子，为研究极端条件下的物质状态提供了新方法。

Abstract: We describe distinctive stellar features indicating the presence of hyperons
in neutron stars. A strongly negative curvature of the mass-radius relation
R(M) is characteristic of hyperons, which can be determined from measurements
of neutron stars with three different masses. Similarly, a reduced second
derivative of the tidal deformability as function of mass $\lambda(M)$ points
to hyperonic degrees of freedom in NS matter. The slopes of such curves R(M)
and \lambda(M) can distinguish a hyperonic equation of state from purely
nucleonic models if they appear increased (decreased for \lambda(M)) relative
to the maximum mass of neutron stars.

Abstract: In the framework of the coherent curvature radiation model of pulsar radio
emission, charged particles responsible for the radio emission are generated on
the polar cap in the localized pair cascade processes called sparks. When a
pulsar can no longer sustain the sparking process on its polar cap, the
coherent radio emission from the pulsar stops, and the pulsar is called dead.
In this work, we revisit the pulsar death phenomena under two popular voltage
gap models: vacuum voltage gap and partially screened voltage gap. We notice
that a dying pulsar resorts to a single spark on the polar cap to sustain the
pair production under both voltage gap frameworks. The presence of only one
spark on the polar cap has important implications for the radio emission
properties of the pulsar. We study the emission properties of five pulsars
close to the lower boundary on the $P-\dot{P}$ plane of the current pulsar
population, as these pulsars are expected to be dying. We find that the dying
pulsars in our sample and the normal pulsar population have very similar
emission properties. We show that the majority of pulsars in the pulsar death
valley, including five pulsars in our sample, show evidence of multiple sparks
as opposed to what is expected from single spark death line models.

Abstract: Ground-based full-sky studies of the angular distribution of arrival
directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays require combining data from
different observatories, such as the Pierre Auger Observatory (Auger) and the
Telescope Array (TA), because no single array can cover all declinations. A
working group comprising members from the Auger and TA collaborations has been
tasked with performing such studies for more than a decade and has found
several indications of full-sky anisotropies. Here, we update the results for
the large- and medium-scale anisotropy analyses using the latest data from TA,
which include corrections for daily and yearly atmospheric effects in data for
large-scale anisotropies and looser selection criteria in data for medium-scale
anisotropies. We extend the latter one by considering two more galaxy
catalogues, consisting of jetted or all AGNs. Finally we also introduce a new
angular harmonic space analysis that allows us to measure both the
auto-correlation and cross-correlation with all catalogues for all multipoles
independently ($\ell_\text{max} = 20$ in this work) and scanning the energy
threshold.

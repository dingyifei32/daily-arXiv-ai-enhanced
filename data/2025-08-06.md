TL;DR: 研究验证了Euclid宽视场巡天中红移断层扫描的准确性，发现基于光测红移的方法优于基于光谱红移均值的方法，并评估了其对宇宙学参数的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决光测红移的系统偏差问题，确保Euclid巡天能准确测量宇宙结构的演化。

Method: 使用自组织映射（SOMs）模拟Euclid宽视场巡天数据，比较基于光测红移和光谱红移均值的红移断层扫描方法。

Result: 基于光测红移的方法在8/10的红移区间满足Euclid要求，而基于光谱红移均值的方法均不满足。在更现实的模拟中，6/10区间满足要求。

Conclusion: 建议采用基于光测红移的红移断层扫描方法，其对宇宙学参数的影响在可接受范围内。

Abstract: The Euclid survey aims to trace the evolution of cosmic structures up to
redshift $z$ $\sim$ 3 and beyond. Its success depends critically on obtaining
highly accurate mean redshifts for ensembles of galaxies $n(z)$ in all
tomographic bins, essential for deriving robust cosmological constraints.
However, photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) suffer from systematic biases
arising from various sources of uncertainty. To address these challenges, we
utilised self-organising maps (SOMs) with mock samples resembling the Euclid
Wide Survey (EWS), to validate Euclid's uncertainty requirement of
$|\Delta\langle z \rangle| = \langle z_{\text{est}} \rangle - \langle z \rangle
\leq 0.002 (1+z)$ per tomographic bin, assuming DR3-level data. We observe that
defining the redshift tomography using the mean spectroscopic redshift
(spec-$z$) per SOM cell, results in none of the ten tomographic redshift bins
satisfying the requirement. In contrast, the redshift tomography on the
photo-$z$s of the EWS-like sample yields superior results, with eight out of
ten bins [$0 < z\leq 2.5$] meeting the Euclid requirement. To enhance the
realism of our study, we morph our calibration sample to mimic the C3R2 survey
in incremental steps. In this context, a maximum of six out of ten bins meet
the requirement, strongly advocating the adoption of a redshift tomography
defined by the photo-$z$s of individual galaxies rather than the commonly used
mean spec-$z$ of SOM cells. To examine the impact on the expected biases for
$\Omega_{\text{m}}$, $\sigma_{8}$, and $\Delta w_{0}$ measured by Euclid, we
perform a Fisher forecast for cosmic shear only, based on our redshift
uncertainties. Here, we find that even under an evaluation of the uncertainty
where the impact of the redshift bias is substantial, most absolute biases
remain below 0.1$\sigma$ in the idealised scenario and below 0.3$\sigma$ in the
more realistic case.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证ΛCDM模型中太阳系加速度对位置漂移信号的贡献是否恒定，并探索宇宙学信息。

Method: 分析Gaia数据发布3中的宇宙参考系数据集，重点约束位置漂移信号的偶极子和四极子，尤其是红移依赖性。

Result: 发现偶极子与预期存在2-3σ的矛盾，四极子显著但无红移演化，可能源于系统误差或宇宙学原因。

Conclusion: 结果尚不明确，需进一步研究，并强调了Gaia数据在宇宙学中的潜在应用。

Abstract: The proper motion (also known as position drift) field of extragalactic
sources at cosmological distances across our sky can be used to measure the
acceleration of the Solar System through the aberration effect. If measured
very precisely, the signal would also hold cosmological information, for
instance about bulk flows of distant sources or the presence of tensor modes.
In the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, the acceleration of the
Solar System is by far the dominant contributor to the position drift signal
for sources at cosmological distances, and the measurement is therefore
expected to yield a constant spheroidal dipole across redshifts as long as
convergence to the cosmic restframe has been reached. The aim of this paper is
to test this hypothesis. We analyze data from the cosmic reference frame
dataset of Gaia data release 3 focusing on constraining the dipole and
quadrupole in the position drift signal, with an emphasis on redshift
dependence of the signal as a consistency test of the $\Lambda$CDM model. The
spheroidal dipole that we find is in mild tension, at the level of $2-3\sigma$,
with the constant-in-redshift signature expected from the local acceleration of
the Solar System. We also find significant quadrupole components, that however
do not have any significant evolution with redshift. The most straightforward
interpretation of these findings is (unknown) systematic errors related to the
Gaia instrumentation, but a cosmological origin is a possibility. Our analysis
remains inconclusive on the cause of the redshift dependence of the dipole and
warrants further investigations with upcoming data releases. We discuss
possible implications of our results and highlight the importance of proper
motion measurements for rest frame determinations in cosmology. In our
discussion, we highlight interesting avenues for doing cosmology with Gaia
data.

### [3] [Visualising relativistic effects in redshift space distortions of large scale structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03249)
*Pritha Paul,Chris Clarkson*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 论文探讨了红移空间中的大规模结构扭曲，包括线性尺度上的牛顿修正和大尺度上的相对论效应，分析了这些效应对星系分布形状的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究红移空间扭曲的物理起源及其对星系分布形状的影响，特别是高阶相对论效应对密集和稀疏区域的扭曲作用。

Method: 定性分析大规模密集区域（如星系团）和稀疏区域（如空洞）在红移空间中的扭曲，考虑高阶相对论效应。

Result: 红移空间扭曲不仅表现为椭球压缩，还包括更高阶的非对称形状（如蛋形或豆形），影响真实空间结构的分析。

Conclusion: 高阶相对论效应对红移空间扭曲有显著影响，需在分析真实空间结构（如堆叠空洞）时加以考虑。

Abstract: Observing large scale structure in redshift space gives rise to the well
known redshift space distortions whereby a spherical distribution of galaxies
is distorted into an ellipsoid along the line of sight of the observer. This
effect is important on linear scales and so can be thought of as a Newtonian
correction to the density perturbation even though their physical origin is in
the Doppler effect. On larger scales subtler aspects of the Doppler and
gravitational redshift effects give rise to further distortions in redshift
space. These further contort objects beyond an ellipsoidal compression, into
shapes with broken line-of-sight symmetry such as an egg- or bean-like shapes.
In this paper, we aim to qualitatively picture how large over-dense regions,
including clusters or superclusters, and under-dense regions, such as voids,
undergoing infall or outflow respectively, become distorted in redshift space
when higher-order relativistic effects are taken into account. This will
contribute when analysing structure in real space such as stacking voids which
are no longer radially symmetric when these effects are included.

### [4] [Human vs. machine -- 1:3. Joint analysis of classical and ML-based summary statistics of the Lyman-$α$ forest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03264)
*S. Chang,P. Nayak,M. Walther,D. Gruen*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 论文比较了传统统计方法和机器学习方法在总结Lyman-α森林数据时的效果，发现机器学习方法不仅包含传统方法的信息，还能提供更强的参数约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计方法在总结Lyman-α森林数据时会丢失信息，机器学习方法可能提供更全面的信息。

Method: 应用三种传统统计方法和一种机器学习方法总结模拟数据，并比较其对参数推断的效果。

Result: 机器学习方法不仅包含传统方法的信息，还能将参数约束提高1:3以上。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法在数据总结和参数推断上优于传统统计方法。

Abstract: In order to compress and more easily interpret Lyman-$\alpha$ forest
(Ly$\alpha$F) datasets, summary statistics, e.g. the power spectrum, are
commonly used. However, such summaries unavoidably lose some information,
weakening the constraining power on parameters of interest. Recently, machine
learning (ML)-based summary approaches have been proposed as an alternative to
human-defined statistical measures. This raises a question: can ML-based
summaries contain the full information captured by traditional statistics, and
vice versa? In this study, we apply three human-defined techniques and one
ML-based approach to summarize mock Ly$\alpha$F data from hydrodynamical
simulations and infer two thermal parameters of the intergalactic medium,
assuming a power-law temperature-density relation. We introduce a metric for
measuring the improvement in the figure of merit when combining two summaries.
Consequently, we demonstrate that the ML-based summary approach not only
contains almost all of the information from the human-defined statistics, but
also that it provides significantly stronger constraints by a ratio of better
than 1:3 in terms of the posterior volume on the temperature-density relation
parameters.

### [5] [High Frequency Peak Radio Sources from the AT20G Catalogue and Their Radio Spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03462)
*Elena Majorova,Olga Zhelenkova*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 研究从AT20G目录中筛选出269个高频峰值（HFP）候选源，分析其光谱特性，发现样本较均匀且多为类星体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索高频峰值源的特性及其与角尺寸的关系，以验证与CSS和GPS源的相似性。

Method: 构建源的光谱，确定光谱指数、峰值频率、峰值通量密度及光谱半宽，并进行光学识别。

Result: 样本中67%源无低频数据，70%为类星体，峰值频率与角尺寸关系与CSS和GPS源一致。

Conclusion: HFP源具有紧凑特性，光谱特性与CSS和GPS源相似，验证了其物理关联。

Abstract: A sample of high-frequency peaker (HFP) candidates was formed from the AT20G
catalog radio sources with spectral indices of the optically thick emission
region $\alpha_{below}$ exceeding +0.5. A study of the spectral properties of
the sources in the sample, which included 269 radio sources, was performed. The
spectra of the sources were constructed and the spectral indices below
$\alpha_{below}$ and above the peak $\alpha_{above}$, the peak frequency
$\nu_{obs}$, the flux density at the peak frequency $S_{peak}$, and the peak
half-width in the radio spectrum were determined. Analysis of the spectra
showed that the sample is fairly homogeneous and consists of HFPs with
$\nu_{obs}>5$ GHz. Most sources (67%) do not have data at frequencies below 0.8
GHz. 187 sources have ultra-inverted spectra ($\alpha_{below}>$+0.7), which is
3.2% of all sources in the AT20G catalog and 70% of radio sources in our
sample. Optical identification of radio sources in the sample showed that 70%
of the hosts are quasars. The sample consists of compact objects with radio
luminosity at 20 GHz in the range of $10^{23}$-$10^{30}$ W/Hz, angular sizes of
emitting regions of radio sources are 0.002-0.25 mas, projected linear sizes
are from 0.2 to 30 pc. The dependence of the peak frequencies of radio sources
on their angular sizes is in good agreement with that previously discovered for
CSS and GPS sources.

### [6] [Measuring the Astrophysical $\barν:ν$ Ratio with IceCube](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02795)
*Barbara Skrzypek,Spencer Klein*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过分析中微子的非弹性散射来测量天体物理中微子与反中微子的比例，填补了相关领域的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 天体物理中微子与反中微子比例的研究对理解其来源和产生机制至关重要，但目前仅有IceCube观测到的单一Glashow事件数据。

Method: 利用10.3年的IceCube数据，分析1 TeV至1 PeV能量范围内的起始径迹事件，通过非弹性散射特性区分中微子和反中微子。

Result: 首次在亚PeV能量范围内测量了天体物理中微子与反中微子的比例。

Conclusion: 该方法为天体物理中微子研究提供了新的工具，有助于进一步理解其产生机制和光谱特性。

Abstract: Recent measurements of astrophysical neutrinos have expanded our
understanding of their nature and origin. However, very little is still known
about the astrophysical $\bar{\nu}:\nu$
  ratio. The only prior measurement is the recent, single Glashow event seen by
IceCube. Understanding the astrophysical $\bar{\nu}:\nu$
  ratio has a bearing on multiple questions, including the astrophysical
spectral shape and neutrino production mechanisms. This analysis uses a new
approach to measuring the astrophysical muon $\bar{\nu}:\nu$ ratio at various
energies. It uses inelasticity, the fraction of the initial neutrino energy
carried away by the hadronic shower. Inelasticity probes the $\bar{\nu}:\nu$
  ratio due to the fact that at energies below roughly 100 TeV, valence quarks
dominate in deep inelastic scattering interactions, leading to different
neutrino and antineutrino inelasticities and cross-sections. We use 10.3 years
of IceCube data consisting of starting tracks at energies between 1 TeV and 1
PeV with a self-veto selection that enhances astrophysical event purity in the
down-going direction. Based on this sample and analysis method, we present the
first measurement of the astrophysical $\bar{\nu}:\nu$
  ratio at sub-PeV energies.

### [7] [The X-ray Variability and Luminosity Function of High Mass X-ray Binaries in the Dwarf Starburst Galaxy IC 10](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02876)
*Breanna A. Binder,Rosalie Lazarus,Mina Thoresen,Silas Laycock,Sayantan Bhattacharya*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 通过19年的Chandra观测分析IC 10矮星暴星系中的X射线双星（XRB）变异性及X射线光度函数（XLF），发现其XRB群体主要由年轻、高质量XRB主导，且亮度较高的HMXBs更持久。首次构建IC 10的XLF，并用于模拟其恒星形成历史。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究IC 10星系中XRB的变异性及XLF，以了解其XRB群体的性质及恒星形成历史。

Method: 分析235 ks的Chandra观测数据，识别23个XRB，研究其动态范围和占空比，构建XLF并模拟恒星形成历史。

Result: 发现IC 10的HMXBs主要由年轻、高质量XRB主导，亮度较高的HMXBs更持久。XLF显示需要近期（3-8 Myr）恒星形成爆发来解释观测到的HMXB XLF亮端。

Conclusion: IC 10的XRB群体和XLF特征支持其近期恒星形成活动的假设，为理解矮星暴星系的恒星形成提供了新视角。

Abstract: We present an analysis of $\sim$235 ks of Chandra observations obtained over
$\sim$19 years of the nearby dwarf starburst galaxy IC 10 in order to study the
X-ray variability and X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of its X-ray binary (XRB)
population. We identify 23 likely XRBs within the 2MASS $K_S$ isophotal radius
and find the distributions of their dynamic ranges and duty cycles are
consistent with a young, high-mass XRB population dominated by supergiant
(sg)-fed systems, consistent with previous work. In general, we find that
brighter HMXBs (those with $L_X\gtrsim$several$\times10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$)
have higher duty cycles (i.e., are more persistent X-ray sources) than fainter
objects, and the dynamic ranges of the sgHMXBs in the lower metallicity
environment of IC 10 are higher than what is observed for comparable systems in
the Milky Way. After filtering out foreground stars on the basis of Gaia
parallaxes we construct, for the first time, the XLF of IC 10. We then use the
XLF to model the star formation history of the galaxy, finding that a very
recent (3-8 Myr) burst of star formation with rate of $\sim$0.5 $M_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$ is needed to adequately explain the observed bright-end
($L_X\sim10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$) of the HMXB XLF.

### [8] [Bounding anisotropic Lorentz Invariance Violation from measurements of the effective energy scale of quantum gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02883)
*Merce Guerrero,Anna Campoy-Ordaz,Robertus Potting,Markus Gaug*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将LIV框架下的能量尺度$E_{QG,n}$转换为SME参数$c^{(6)}_{(I)jm}$的方法，并改进了光子SME系数的约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究很少将LIV的一般约束转化为SME等具体理论框架的系数，尤其是对$E_{QG,2}$的约束。

Method: 开发了一种透明的方法，将$E_{QG,2}$转换为SME参数，并标准化了现有约束。

Result: 改进了光子SME系数的约束约一个数量级。

Conclusion: 提供了一种从LIV到SME的一致转换方法，显著提升了SME系数的约束精度。

Abstract: Observations of energy-dependent photon time delays from distant flaring
sources provide significant constraints on Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV).
Such effects originate from modified vacuum dispersion relations, causing
differences in propagation times for photons emitted simultaneously from
gamma-ray bursts, active galactic nuclei, or pulsars. These modifications are
often parametrized within a general framework by an effective quantum gravity
energy scale $E_{QG,n}$. While such general constraints are well established in
the LIV literature, their translation into specific coefficients of alternative
theoretical frameworks, such as the Standard-Model Extension (SME), is rarely
carried out. In particular, existing bounds on the quadratic case ($n=2$) of
$E_{QG,n}$ can be systematically converted into constraints on the
non-birefringent, CPT-conserving SME coefficients $c^{(6)}_{(I)jm}$. This work
provides a concise overview of the relevant SME formalism and introduces a
transparent conversion method from $E_{QG,2}$ to SME parameters. We review the
most stringent time-of-flight-based bounds on $E_{QG,n}$ and standardize them
by accounting for systematics, applying missing prefactors, and transforming
results into two-sided Gaussian uncertainties where needed. We then use these
standardized constraints, along with additional bounds from the literature, to
improve bounds on the individual SME coefficients of the photon sector by about
an order of magnitude. A consistent methodology is developed to perform this
conversion from the general LIV framework to the SME formalism.

### [9] [Influence of Density Distribution on Synchrotron Polarization Dispersion in Magnetized Interstellar Medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02938)
*Yawen Xiao,Jianfu Zhang,Alex Lazarian,Dmitri Pogosyan*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种称为偏振频率分析（PFA）的新方法，用于研究湍流磁场的特性，弥补了传统法拉第旋转测量合成的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统法拉第旋转测量合成方法在研究湍流磁场特性时存在困难，因此需要一种新的方法来克服这些限制。

Method: 基于合成偏振观测和MHD湍流模拟数据，研究了密度与磁场耦合效应对同步辐射偏振分散的影响，并应用PFA技术分析了不同模拟环境下的湍流磁场特性。

Result: PFA技术能够在弱耦合效应下揭示湍流磁场的标度斜率，在强耦合效应下反映旋转测量的标度斜率。该方法避免了法拉第去偏振的影响。

Conclusion: PFA技术是一种有前景的方法，可用于利用低频射电望远镜阵列（LOFAR）和平方公里阵列（SKA）的观测数据揭示湍流特性。

Abstract: Faraday rotation measure synthesis is a well-known approach originated in
Burn (1966) and later developed by Sokoloff et al. (1998) and Brentjens \& de
Bruyn (2005) for studying magnetic fields. This work presents a complementary
approach--the polarization frequency analysis (PFA)--allowing the properties of
the turbulent magnetic field, which are difficult for Burn's original approach.
Based on synthetic polarization observation of MHD turbulence simulation data,
we study the influence of the coupling effect between density and magnetic
field on synchrotron polarization dispersion. By applying the PFA to different
simulated interstellar turbulence environments, we find that the PFA technique
can reveal the scaling slope of the turbulent magnetic field in the case of a
weak coupling effect and can also reflect the scaling slope of the rotation
measure in the case of a strong coupling effect. Since avoiding the influence
of Faraday depolarization, the PFA technique is a promising way to uncover
turbulence properties using observational data from the Low-Frequency Array for
Radio Astronomy and the Square Kilometer Array.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究了CTA 102的喷流宽度剖面，发现其几何形状为拟抛物线型，未观察到明显的锥形过渡，表明Bondi半径不足以解释喷流行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索喷流几何形状从抛物线到锥形的过渡是否与Bondi半径相关，以增进对活动星系核喷流行为的理解。

Method: 使用多频VLBA图像分析CTA 102的喷流宽度剖面，拟合单幂律模型。

Result: 喷流宽度剖面显示拟抛物线几何形状，无明确锥形过渡，且Bondi半径附近未发现结构断裂。

Conclusion: Bondi半径单独不足以解释喷流行为，喷流宽度振荡表明存在其他物理过程影响喷流约束。

Abstract: Active Galactic Nucleus jets have long be thought to exhibit a conical jet
shape, but recently, several jets were found to have a transition from
parabolic to conical structure. As more sources are investigated, this
collimation profile appears to represent a common paradigm. Previous works
suggest that the Bondi radius may serve as an indicator of the transition
location, although discrepancies have been observed in some sources. To explore
this further, we selected CTA 102 for which existing literature presents mixed
evidence regarding the presence of a jet geometry break. We investigated the
jet width profile of CTA 102 to study the possible transition changes in the
jet, thereby improving the understanding of connection between Bondi radius and
jet transition. We used multi-frequency VLBA images of CTA 102 at 2, 5, and 8
(single epoch), and 15, 22 and 43 GHz (stacked). The jet width profile was
modeled with a single power law $W_{jet}\propto r^{\epsilon}$ yielding a
power-law index of $\epsilon=0.69\pm0.02$, indicative of a quasi-parabolic
geometry with no clear transition to a conical regime. The absence of
discernible structural break around the Bondi radius implies that the physical
conditions associated with the radius alone are insufficient to explain the jet
collimation behaviour. On the other hand, we observe oscillatory features in
the jet width profile, suggesting the influence of additional physical
processes beyond gravitational confinement. These findings contribute to a more
nuanced understanding of jet collimation in AGN and highlight the complexity of
jet-environment interactions.

TL;DR: JWST观测SN 1987A的第二批数据确认了中心区域的窄线特征，并发现了新的离子线，暗示中子星可能具有510 km/s的踢速度。尘埃散射和吸收解释了部分观测现象，脉冲星风星云或冷却中子星模型均与数据兼容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究SN 1987A中心区域的电离特性，以确定是否存在致密天体（如中子星）及其动力学特征。

Method: 利用JWST的NIRSpec和MIRI/MRS进行高分辨率光谱观测，分析窄线特征及其位移，结合尘埃散射和吸收模型解释数据。

Result: 确认了多条窄线特征，发现中子星可能具有510 km/s的踢速度；尘埃散射解释了[Ca IV]的性质，而尘埃吸收在长波段起重要作用。

Conclusion: 观测支持中心存在致密天体，但脉冲星风星云和冷却中子星模型均与数据兼容，未来短波段的观测将有助于进一步区分模型。

Abstract: The first JWST observations of SN 1987A provided clear evidence that a
compact object is ionizing the innermost ejecta. Here we analyze a second epoch
of JWST NIRSpec and MIRI/MRS observations to better characterize the properties
of this region, aided by a higher spectral resolving power for the new NIRSpec
data. We confirm the presence of the previously identified narrow lines from
the central region; [Ar VI] 4.5292 $\mu$m, [Ar II] 6.9853 $\mu$m, [S IV]
10.5105 $\mu$m, and [S III] 18.7130 $\mu$m, and also identify similar
components in [Ca V] 4.1585 $\mu$m, [Cl II] 14.3678 $\mu$m, and possibly [Fe
II] 1.6440 $\mu$m. These lines are blueshifted by $\sim$ -250 km/s, while the
emission region is spatially unresolved and located southeast of the center.
The offset and blueshift could imply a kick velocity of $510 \pm 55$ km/s for
the neutron star. We also identify [Ca IV] 3.2068 $\mu$m near the center, but
it is displaced to the north and has a redshift of $\sim 700$ km/s. We find
that scattering by dust in the ejecta with a typical grain size $\sim 0.3\
\mu$m can explain the [Ca IV] properties and the absence of other narrow lines
at shorter wavelengths, while dust absorption is important at $\lambda \gtrsim
8\ \mu$m. Photoionization models for a pulsar wind nebula and a cooling neutron
star are both compatible with the observations, with the exception of the [Fe
II] feature. The two models primarily differ at short wavelengths, where new
lines are expected to emerge over time as the optical depth of dust in the
expanding ejecta decreases.

Abstract: We perform a suite of numerical simulations of tidal disruption events, using
smoothed particle hydrodynamics, for a close binary system consisting of two
low-mass white dwarfs, and an intermediate mass non-spinning black hole. The
binary components are considered to be detached and on the same plane with the
black hole. Our results quantify how the outcomes of these events depend
crucially on the positional configuration of the binary components at the
orbital pericenter, and we also show how distinctive behaviour for
non-identical mass binaries arise, as compared to identical ones. We highlight
these differences on observables such as mass fallback rates, kick velocities
and gravitational waves, and also compute clump formation time within the
stellar debris. In our setup, prograde binary motion, where the angular
momentum of the binary is in the same direction as that of the center of mass
motion around the black hole, is qualitatively similar to multiple events of
single star tidal disruptions. However, we argue that interactions between
stellar debris in the corresponding retrograde scenarios result in different
and distinct outcomes. Our results should serve as indicative benchmarks in the
observational aspects of tidal interactions between close white dwarf binaries
and intermediate mass black holes.

Abstract: We perform a detailed observational analysis of several galactic X-ray
binaries, focusing on the interplay between black hole spin, jet power, and
radiative efficiency within the context of Blandford-Znajek-powered jets. Using
updated measurements from continuum fitting and Fe-line methods, we constrain
the spin parameter a and the deviation parameter $\beta$ for five key black
hole systems: H1743-322, XTE J1550-564, GRS 1124-683, GRO J1655-40, and GRS
1915+105. For each system, we compare the allowed parameter spaces derived
independently from observed radiative efficiencies and emitted jet powers under
different assumptions for the jet Lorentz factor $\Gamma=2,5$. By overlapping
these observational constraints with theoretical expectations for regular black
holes, we assess the viability of various spin-deviation combinations in
explaining the observed phenomena. Our results reveal significant restrictions
on the allowed values of $\beta$, with typical upper bounds around 0.38 - 0.4,
except for rapidly spinning sources where the constraint becomes notably
tighter. We further present a modified method for generating rotating solutions
from static regular black hole spacetimes and provide a robust theoretical
framework for relating jet power to black hole angular frequency in curved
geometries. We also find that the theoretical jet power is modified by
regularization factor for regular black holes. These findings place stringent
observational bounds on deviations from the Kerr geometry and provide important
insight into the astrophysical mechanisms powering accreting stellar-mass black
holes.

Conclusion: 暗物质动力学摩擦扩大了初始参数空间并延长了分叉周期，这些系统是理想的多信使天体。

Abstract: The black hole (BH) spin could significantly change the density of dark
matter (DM) in its vicinity, creating a mini-spike of the density of DM. The
dynamical friction (DF) between DM and the companion star of a BH can provide
an efficient loss of angular momentum, driving the BH-main sequence (MS) star
binary to evolve toward a compact orbit system. We investigate the influence of
the DF of DM on the detectability of intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH)-MS
binaries as low-frequency gravitational wave (GW) sources. Taking into account
the DF of DM, we employ the detailed binary evolution code MESA to model the
evolution of a large number of IMBH-MS binaries. Our simulation shows that the
DF of DM can drive those IMBH-MS binaries to evolve toward low-frequency GW
sources for a low donor-star mass, a high spike index, or a short initial
orbital period. When the spike index $\gamma=1.60$, those IMBH-MS binaries with
donor-star masses of $1.0-3.4~ M_{\odot}$ and initial orbital periods of
$0.65-16.82~ \rm days$ could potentially evolve into visible LISA sources
within a distance of $10~\rm kpc$. The DF of DM can enlarge the initial
parameter space and prolong the bifurcation periods. In the low-frequency GW
source stage, the X-ray luminosities of those IMBH X-ray binaries are $\sim
10^{35}-10^{36}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$, hence they are ideal multimessenger objects.

Conclusion: 该模型为快速射电暴的起源提供了一种新的物理机制，并通过观测数据验证了其可行性。

Abstract: We propose a new model for the origin of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs),
attributing these phenomena to sudden discharges of accumulated electric charge
in the accretion disk of compact objects such as black holes. Our framework
demonstrates how Compton scattering within the disk plasma generates charge
separation, creating a capacitor-like system stabilized by the equilibrium
between radiation pressure and electrostatic forces. We detail the discharge
process through destabilizing mechanisms in this capacitor, resulting in
radiative emission. We compare our model's prediction on radiation signatures
with observational data, using FRB2018725A as an example to obtain key
quantitative relationships. Additionally, we estimate the total charge buildup
via Compton scattering for a stellar-mass black hole, constrained by the
best-fit between our model and observations, and determine the corresponding
electron density in the accretion disk for this mechanism to operate.

Abstract: Binary black holes (BBHs) forming in the accretion disks of active galactic
nuclei (AGNs) represent a promising channel for gravitational-wave production.
BBHs are typically expected to originate at migration traps, i.e. radial
locations where the Type I migration of embedded stellar-mass black holes (BHs)
transitions from outwards to inwards. In this work, we test this assumption by
explicitly simulating the radial migration of BH pairs in AGN disks under
different torque prescriptions, including thermal effects and the switch to
Type II migration. We quantify where and when binaries form as a function of
supermassive BH (SMBH) mass, disk viscosity, and migrating BH mass. We find
that while the majority of pair-up events occur near migration traps, a
substantial fraction takes place elsewhere in the disk, particularly for
high-viscosity disks ($\alpha=0.1-0.4$) and SMBHs with mass above a threshold
of $10^{7.5}$ solar masses, where differential migration is most efficient. The
inclusion of thermal torques favors pair-up in outer locations of the disk and
facilitates rapid pair-up. We also investigate hierarchical BBH formation,
showing that higher-generation pair-ups are more tightly clustered around trap
locations. Our results provide realistic prescriptions for BBH pair-up
locations and timescales, highlighting the limitations of assuming fixed BBH
formation sites.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Pop III恒星产生GRB的条件及其效率，以理解观测到的GRB率与理论预测的差异。

Method: 通过恒星演化模型模拟不同质量和旋转速率的Pop III恒星，结合吸积和喷流传播模型计算黑洞质量和自旋。

Result: 在中等风效率下，Pop III GRB产生效率为10^-5至3×10^-4 M⊙^-1，预计Swift可观测到2-40次/年。

Conclusion: 若观测率远低于预测，则风效率需高于0.45，暗示孤立Pop III恒星难以产生GRB，支持双星演化场景。

Abstract: The rate of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) from isolated Pop III stars
is not well known, as it depends on our poor understanding of their initial
mass function (IMF), rotation rates, stellar evolution, and mass loss. A
sub-population of massive ($M_{\rm ZAMS}\gtrsim20M_\odot$) Pop III stars is
expected to suffer core-collapse and launch a relativistic jet that would power
a GRB. In the collapsar scenario, a key requirement is that the pre-supernova
star imparts sufficient angular momentum to the remnant black hole to form an
accretion disc and launch a relativistic jet, which demands rapid initial
rotation of the progenitor star and suppression of line-driven mass loss during
its chemically homogeneous evolution. Here we explore a grid of stellar
evolution models of Pop III stars with masses $20\leq M_{\rm ZAMS}/M_\odot \leq
100$, which are initially rotating with surface angular velocities $0.6\leq
\Omega_0/\Omega_{\rm crit}\leq 0.9$, where centrifugally-driven mass loss
ensues for $\Omega>\Omega_{\rm crit}$. Realistic accretion and jet propagation
models are used to derive the initial black hole masses and spins, and jet
breakout times for these stars. The GRB production efficiency is obtained over
a phase space comprising progenitor initial mass, rotation, and wind
efficiency. For modest wind efficiency of $\eta_{\rm wind}=0.45-0.35$, the Pop
III GRB production efficiency is $\eta_{\rm
GRB}\sim10^{-5}-3\times10^{-4}\,M_\odot^{-1}$, respectively, for a top-heavy
IMF. This yields an observable all-sky equivalent rate of $\sim2-40\,{\rm
yr}^{-1}$ by \textit{Swift}, with 75\% of the GRBs located at $z\lesssim8$. If
the actual observed rate is much lower, then this would imply $\eta_{\rm
wind}>0.45$, which leads to significant loss of mass and angular momentum that
renders isolated Pop III stars incapable of producing GRBs and favours a binary
scenario instead.

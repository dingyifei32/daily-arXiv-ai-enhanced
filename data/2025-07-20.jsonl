The dominant approach in cosmology has been to use\nthe so-called halo model, which assumes radially symmetric profiles centered\naround luminous tracers such as galaxies. More recently, field-level machine\nlearning methods have been proposed that can learn to estimate the unobserved\nfield after being trained on simulations. However, it is unclear whether\nmachine learning methods indeed significantly improve over linear methods or\nthe halo model. In this paper we make a systematic comparison of different\napproaches to reconstruct dark matter and baryons from galaxy data using the\nCAMELS simulations. We find the best results using a combined GNN-CNN approach.\nWe also provide a general analysis and visualization of the relationship of\nmatter, baryons, halos and galaxies in these simulations to interpret our\nresults."}

Consequently,\nthe Fourier modes in common between simulation and observation have limited\noverlap, especially in cylindrical (2D) k-space that is natural for 21-cm\ninterferometry. This makes sample variance (i.e. the deviation of the simulated\nsample from the population mean due to finite box size) a potential issue when\ninterpreting upcoming 21-cm observations. We introduce \\texttt{21cmPSDenoiser},\na score-based diffusion model that can be applied to a single, forward-modelled\nrealisation of the 21-cm 2D power spectrum (PS), predicting the corresponding\n\\textit{population mean} on-the-fly during Bayesian inference. Individual\nsamples of 2D Fourier amplitudes of wave modes relevant to current 21-cm\nobservations can deviate from the mean by over 50\\% for 300 cMpc simulations,\neven when only considering stochasticity due to sampling of Gaussian initial\nconditions. \\texttt{21cmPSDenoiser} reduces this deviation by an order of\nmagnitude, outperforming current state-of-the-art sample variance mitigation\ntechniques like Fixing \\& Pairing by a factor of few at almost no additional\ncomputational cost ($\\sim6$s per PS). Unlike emulators, the denoiser is not\ntied to a particular model or simulator since its input is a (model-agnostic)\nrealisation of the 2D 21-cm PS. Indeed, we confirm that it generalises to PS\nproduced with a different 21-cm simulator than those on which it was trained.\nTo quantify the improvement in parameter recovery, we simulate a 21-cm PS\ndetection by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Arrays (HERA) and run different\ninference pipelines corresponding to commonly-used approximations.

In\nthis review, we present an overview of recent developments in GW standard siren\ncosmology, the latest observational results, and prospects for constraining\ncosmological parameters using future GW detections. We first introduce standard\nsirens based on how redshift information is obtained and outline the Bayesian\nframework used in cosmological parameter estimation. We then review the\nmeasurements on the Hubble constant from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network and\npresent the potential role of future standard siren observations in\ncosmological parameter estimations. A central focus of this review is the\nunique ability of GW observations to break cosmological parameter degeneracies\ninherent in the EM observations. Since the cosmological parameter degeneracy\ndirections of GW and EM observations are quite different (roughly orthogonal in\nsome cases), their combination can significantly improve constraints on\ncosmological parameters. This complementarity is expected to become one of the\nmost critical advantages for GW standard siren cosmology. Looking forward, we\nhighlight the importance of combining GW standard sirens with other emerging\nlate-universe cosmological probes such as fast radio bursts, 21 cm intensity\nmapping, and strong gravitational lensing to forge a precise cosmological probe\nfor exploring the late universe.

EELRs only appear in post-merger systems and all such hosts at\nz<0.045 show them. Thus, we conclude that TDEs and galaxy mergers have a strong\nrelation, and >45% of post-merger hosts in the sample exhibit EELRs.\nFurthermore, we constrained the distributions of stellar masses near the\ncentral black holes (BHs), using the spectral synthesis code Starlight and\nBPASS stellar evolution models.

In order to quantify the contribution\nof this source class to the pool of Galactic CRs, we need to estimate the\ntypical acceleration efficiency of these systems. Methods. We search for\nemission in the GeV band, as most of the energy is emitted in this band. We\nperform an analysis of Fermi-LAT data collected towards the M16 region, a\nstar-forming region also known as the Eagle Nebula, which hosts the Young\nMassive Star Cluster NGC 6611. We model the acceleration at the stellar wind\ntermination shock and the propagation through the wind-blown bubble to derive\nthe energetics of the process and interpret the GeV observations. Results. We\nfind significant GeV emission in correspondence of a molecular cloud associated\nto the Young Massive Star Cluster NGC 6611. We interpret this as hadronic\nemission associated to particle accelerated at the cluster wind termination\nshock and propagated through the low-density wind-excavated bubble to the\ncloud. Our modeling allows us to put firm constraints on the acceleration\nefficiency in NGC 6611, assessing it between $\\sim$ 1 % and $\\sim$ 4 %."}

However, multiple physical\nmechanisms, including pion/kaon condensation, magnetic fields, superfluidity,\ndark matter clustering, and violations of general relativity, can lead to a\npressure anisotropy. This work presents a comprehensive measurement of pressure\nanisotropy in neutron stars. Our analysis incorporates both an extensive set of\nnuclear experimental constraints and multi-messenger astrophysical\nobservations, including gravitational wave detections and electromagnetic\nobservations. The Bayesian framework employed marginalizes over equation of\nstate uncertainties and allows the anisotropy to vary between individual\nneutron stars. We find the Bayes factor for anisotropy against isotropy is\n$e^{0.46}=10^{0.20}=1.58\\gtrsim 3:2$. Additionally, the posterior indicates a\npopulation-wide preference for negative pressure anisotropy, with GW170817\nserving as the primary contributor. The individual variability suggests\ndensity-scale-independent anisotropy, potentially attributable to magnetic\nfields, dark matter clustering, or deviations from general relativity rather\nthan phase transitions. While the evidence for pressure anisotropy remains\ninconclusive, these results demonstrate that pressure anisotropy can be\nutilized as a valuable diagnostic tool for identifying missing physics in\nneutron star modeling or revealing tension among observations in the era of\nmulti-messenger astronomy."}

We report on an\nXMM-Newton Target of Opportunity observation performed on 2025 March 4, more\nthan twenty days after the outburst onset.

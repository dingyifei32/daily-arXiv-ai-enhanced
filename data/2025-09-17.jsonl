Specifically, we study the biases introduced by the customary\nuse of uniform priors on the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameters, $w_0$\nand $w_a$, when assessing evidence for evolving dark energy. To do so, we\nconstruct theory-informed priors on $(w_0, w_a)$ using a normalizing flow (NF),\ntrained on two representative quintessence models, which learns the\ndistribution of these parameters conditional on the underlying $\\Lambda$CDM\nparameters. In the combined $\\textit{Planck}$ CMB + DESI BAO analysis we find\nthat the apparent tension with a cosmological constant in the CPL framework can\nbe reduced from $\\sim 3.1\\sigma$ to $\\sim 1.3\\sigma$ once theory-informed\npriors are applied, rendering the result effectively consistent with\n$\\Lambda$CDM. For completeness, we also analyze combinations that include Type\nIa supernova data, showing similar shifts toward the $\\Lambda$CDM limit. Taken\ntogether, the observed sensitivity to prior choices in these analyses arises\nbecause uniform priors - often mischaracterized as \"uninformative\" - can\nactually bias inferences toward unphysical parameter regions. Consequently, our\nresults underscore the importance of adopting physically motivated priors to\nensure robust cosmological inferences, especially when evaluating new\nhypotheses with only marginal statistical support. Lastly, our NF-based\nframework achieves these results by post-processing existing MCMC chains,\nrequiring $\\approx 1$ hour of additional CPU compute time on top of the base\nanalysis - a dramatic speedup over direct model sampling that highlights the\nscalability of this approach for testing diverse theoretical models."}

Upper limits of the luminosity measurements\nwere included in the analysis by using the Kaplan-Meier estimator method. It is\nfound that the high-z quasars exhibit X-ray variability on both short-term\n(hours-to-days) and intermediate-term (weeks-to-months) timescales, with\nshort-term variability dominating the overall variation. A linear correlation\nexists between the global mean ($\\mu_{\\mathrm{L_{2-10\\,keV}}}$) and standard\ndeviation ($\\sigma_{\\mathrm{L_{2-10\\,keV}}}$) of X-ray luminosities, which is\nindependent of the X-ray photon index and optical-to-X-ray spectral slope. The\nlocalized stochastic magnetic reconnection mechanism is strongly favored, which\ncan naturally lead to a scale-invariant power-law energy distribution and\nsatisfactorily explain the correlation. The $\\sigma$-$\\mu$ correlation\nparallels with the well-documented rms-flux relation of low-z active galactic\nnuclei (AGNs), implying the magnetic reconnection mechanism could drive\nshort-timescale X-ray variability in both high- and low-z AGNs.

J090630+693030 is\nfound to have a rest-frame period of 182.46 days and J143023+420436 has a\nperiod of 16.89 days, both could be explained by the global evolution of\nplasmoid chains, in which magnetic islands formed during reconnection may merge\nsuccessively."}

This interaction gives rise to secondary radiation in\ndifferent wavelength ranges, known as reprocessed emission. In eclipsing LMXBs,\nthe reprocessed emission from the bursts can be examined during eclipses, as\nthe primary emission is blocked and only the reprocessed emission is visible.\nWe searched for bursts during eclipses in the archival RXTE data of the\neclipsing LMXBs and found them in EXO 0748-676 and XTE J1710-281. In EXO\n0748-676, seven bursts were found to occur near eclipse egress, with their\ntails extending beyond the eclipse, and one such burst was found for XTE\nJ1710-281. We estimate the reprocessing fraction at orbital phases near eclipse\negress by modeling the peculiar eclipse bursts detected in both systems, which\nhave tails extending beyond the eclipses. We observe an increasing trend in\nreprocessing fraction as these eclipse bursts occur closer to the eclipse\negress. We discuss the possibilities of reprocessing in the ablated wind from\nthe companion star, the accretion disc, and the disc wind in EXO 0748-676 and\nXTE J1710-281.

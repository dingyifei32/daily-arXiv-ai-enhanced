The 21-cm signal from EoR is expected to be\nhighly non-Gaussian; therefore, we need to use higher-order statistics, e.g.,\nbispectrum. Moreover, the forward modeling of the signal and its statistics for\na varying set of model parameters requires rerunning the simulations many\ntimes, which is computationally very expensive. To overcome this challenge,\nmany artificial neural network (ANN) based emulators have been introduced,\nwhich produce the 21-cm summaries in a fraction of the time. However, ANN\nemulators have a drawback: they can only produce point-value predictions; thus,\nthey fail to capture the uncertainty associated with their predictions.\nTherefore, when such emulators are used in the Bayesian inference pipeline,\nthey cannot naturally propagate their prediction uncertainties to the estimated\nmodel parameters. To address this problem, we have developed Bayesian neural\nnetwork (BNN) emulators for the 21-cm signal statistics, which provide the\nposterior distribution of the predicted signal statistics, including their\nprediction uncertainty. We use these BNN emulators in our Bayesian inference\npipeline to infer the EoR parameters through 21-cm summaries of the mock\nobservation of 21-cm signal with telescopic noise for $1000$ hr of SKA-LOW\nobservation. We show that BNN emulators can capture the prediction uncertainty\nfor the 21-cm power spectrum and bispectrum, and using these emulators in the\ninference pipeline provides better and tighter constraints on them. We reduced\nthe training dataset and showed that, for smaller training datasets, BNN\noutperforms the ANN emulators. We also show that using the bispectrum as a\nsummary statistic gives better constraints on EoR parameters than the power\nspectrum."}

In\nthis work, we introduce two approaches aiming to reconstruct the full 21-cm\ndensity field, including the missing modes in the wedge: (a) a field-level\ninference under an effective field theory (EFT) framework; (b) a\ndiffusion-based deep generative model trained on simulations. Under the EFT\nframework, we implement a fully differentiable forward model that maps the\ninitial conditions of matter fluctuations to the observed, foreground-filtered\n21-cm maps. This enables a gradient-based sampler to simultaneously sample the\ninitial conditions and bias parameters, allowing a physically motivated mode\nreconstruction. Alternatively, we apply a variational diffusion model to\nperform 21-cm density reconstruction at the map level. Our model is trained on\nsemi-numerical simulations over a wide range of astrophysical parameters.

We simulate this process numerically and find that\nit can eject magnetic loops from the star. The internal magnetic field first\ndiffuses to the crust surrounding the liquid core and then erupts from the\nsurface, taking a significant amount of crustal material with it. The eruption\ninvolves magnetic reconnection, generating a giant gamma-ray flare. A\nsignificant fraction of the eruption energy is carried by the neutron-rich\ncrustal material, which must go through a phase of decompression and nuclear\nheating. The massive ejecta should produce additional emission components after\nthe giant flare, including radioactively powered gamma-rays, optical emission,\nand much later a radio afterglow. The predicted eruptions may rarely happen in\nobserved magnetars in our galaxy, which are relatively old and rarely produce\ngiant flares. The model can, however, explain the extremely powerful flare from\nSGR 1806-20 in December 2004, its ejecta mass, and afterglow. More active,\nyounger magnetars may produce frequent crustal eruptions and form unusual\nnebulae. Such hyperactive magnetars are candidates for the central engines of\ncosmological fast radio bursts (FRBs). We argue that each eruption launches an\nultrarelativistic magnetosonic pulse leading the ejecta and steepening into a\nrelativistic shock capable of emitting an FRB."}

The aperture-mass skewness\nis a compressed representation of three-point shear information, designed to\ncapture non-Gaussian features while keeping the data vector computationally\ntractable. We find that including the aperture-mass skewness improves the\n$S_8$-$\\Omega_m$ figure of merit by 80% compared to the 2PCF-only case,\nprimarily due to the breaking of degeneracies. Our joint analysis yields a\nconstraint of $S_8=0.736\\pm0.020$, which is slightly lower than the\ntwo-point-only result and increases the tension with Planck 2018 to 3.2$\\sigma$\nin the $S_8$-$\\Omega_m$ plane. The two- and three-point statistics are found to\nbe internally consistent across redshift bins and angular scales, and we detect\nno significant intrinsic alignment signal.

This finite-sample estimation introduces noise into the\ncovariance, which propagates to parameter estimates, a phenomenon known as the\nDodelson-Schneider (DS) effect, leading to inflated uncertainties. While the\nMassively Optimized Parameter Estimation and Data compression (MOPED) algorithm\noffers lossless Fisher information-preserving compression, it does not mitigate\nthe DS effect when the compression matrix itself is derived from noisy\ncovariances. In this paper, we propose a modified compression scheme, powered\nMOPED ($p$-MOPED), which suppresses noise propagation by balancing information\nretention and covariance estimate noise reduction through a tunable power-law\ntransformation of the sample correlation matrix. We test $p$-MOPED against\nstandard and diagonal MOPED on toy models and on cosmological data from the\nSubaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Year 3 weak lensing survey.

In this work, we apply the Hartle-Thorne spacetimes to study the\nfrequencies of the precession for both geodesic and non-geodesic (fluid) flows.\nWe build on previous findings on the effect of the NS quadrupole moment, which\nrevealed the importance of the interplay between the relativistic and classical\nprecession. Because of this interplay, the widely used Lense-Thirring metric,\nlinear in the NS angular momentum, is insufficient to calculate the behaviour\nof the precession frequency across an astrophysically relevant range of NS\nangular momentum values. We find that even for a moderately oblate NSs, the\ndependencies of the precession frequency on the NS angular momentum at radii\nwithin the innermost accretion region have maxima that occur at relatively low\nvalues of the NS angular momentum. We conclude that very different groups of\naccreting NSs, slow and fast rotators, can display the same precession\nfrequencies. This may explain the lack of evidence for a correlation between\nthe frequencies of the observed low-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations and\nthe NS spin. In our work, we provide a full, general description of precession\nbehaviour, and also examples that assume specific NS and quark star (MIT bag)\nequation of state.

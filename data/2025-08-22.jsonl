The color\nevolution of kilonova emission associated with short GRB is significant when\nthe spectrum is thermal emission, while it tends towards a constant when the\nspectrum is non-thermal radiation. On the other hand, if the central engine is\na black hole (BH) which is promptly generated by the NS-NS merger or NS-BH\nmerger, then the kilonova is powered only by the radioactive decay. There is no\ncolor evolution at the beginning before the peak of kilonova emission, but is\nsignificantly and rapidly increasing after the peak. On the contrary, if the\ncentral engine is a magnetar or stable NS, the kilonova emission is contributed\nfrom radioactive decay, magnetar, and PWN. The color evolution after the peak\nof kilonova emission is complex behavior which depends on the rotational energy\nand spin-down time-scale of magnetar, and finally tend to a constant in the\nlate state."}

Pulsars in which the two\npoles interact can potentially help solve this challenge. We here report the\ndiscovery of interaction of emission between the main and the interpulse in two\npulsars -- J1842+0358 and J1926+0737, based on FAST and MeerKAT data. When\nemission is bright in one pulse, it is dim in the other. Even when split in\njust 2 groups (strong versus weak) the anti-correlated brightness can change by\na factor $\\gtrsim$2. Both sources furthermore show the same quasi-periodic\nmodulation from the main and interpulse, at timescales exceeding 100 pulse\nperiods. The longitude stationary modulation from at least one pulse suggests\nthat it is a key signature for interpulse pulsars showing main and interpulse\ninteraction. If the interaction happens within an isolated magnetosphere,\nwithout external influences, either communication between the opposite poles is\nrequired, or global changes drive both. This detailed study of these two\nsources was only made possible by improved sensitivity. The fact that both show\ntwo-pole modulation strongly suggests this is a general phenomenon in\ninterpulse pulsars. In regular pulsars only one pole is visible, and a number\nof these show correlated changes between the profile and spin-down rate, that\nare also thought to be caused by global magnetospheric changes. Our results\nstrengthen the case that such interactive magnetospheres are common to all\npulsars."}

We solve the QKEs with\nvarying radial resolution ($r_{\\mathrm{bins}} = 150 \\, , 1500 \\, , 15000$) to\nassess numerical convergence in angular distributions, number densities, and\nenergy spectra for four neutrino flavors ($\\nu_e$, $\\bar{\\nu}_e$, $\\nu_x$,\n$\\bar{\\nu}_x$). Our results demonstrate that the solutions are numerically\nconverged already at the coarsest resolution, with higher resolutions yielding\nalmost identical outcomes. We introduce random perturbations to each radial\nbin, thus adding perturbations with a length scale that is related to the\nradial resolution. We study both time-independent and time-dependent\nperturbations to the matter density that affect the collision term and analyze\ntheir effects on neutrino flavor evolution. We find that such fluctuations do\nnot induce any significant instabilities or qualitative changes in flavor\nevolution. Angular structure remains robust, and flavor-dependent number\ndensities and energy spectra show only minor deviations compared to the\nunperturbed case. These findings suggest that matter perturbations have a\nnegligible effect on neutrino flavor evolution in spherically symmetric\nsettings."}

Abell 665 is one of only a few clusters with such a powerful shock\n($M \\sim 3$) and provides a unique opportunity to study the thermalization\ntimescale of the ICM, particularly the electron-ion equilibration timescale.\nUnderstanding this timescale is crucial for determining how energy from the\nmerger is distributed between thermal and non-thermal particle populations.\nUsing $\\sim$200 ks of NuSTAR observations, we measure the temperature\ndistribution across the shock to distinguish between two heating models: (1) an\ninstant, collisionless model where ions and electrons are immediately heated at\nthe shock front, and (2) a collisional model where electrons are initially\nadiabatically compressed at the shock and subsequently equilibrate with the\nions over $\\sim$100 Myr. Our measurements favor the delayed equilibration\nmodel, suggesting that electrons do not immediately reach thermal equilibrium\nwith the ions at the shock front and instead equilibrate over $t_{eq} = (4.0\n\\pm 3.4) \\times 10^8$ yrs. Additionally, our temperature measurements indicate\nthat the Mach number may be lower than previously estimated ($M = 2.8 \\pm\n0.7$), suggesting that the shock strength has been overestimated in past\nstudies. These results add to our understanding of the microphysics governing\nhow thermal energy is distributed in diffuse plasmas like the ICM, with\nimplications for galaxy cluster evolution, large scale structure formation, and\ncosmology."}

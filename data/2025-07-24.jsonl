Using\nboundary layer theory, we obtain analytic solutions for the two cases and apply\nour results to fallback accretion onto a black hole following a failed\nsupernova explosion. We give predictions for the observational signature of\nfallback accretion using realistic progenitor properties from MESA, both for a\nfully ionized inflow and for the more realistic case in which\nrecombination/ionization take place due to low photospheric temperatures. The\nobserved fading sources coincident with the failed-supernova candidates in NGC\n6946 and M31 are too luminous to be powered by spherical accretion onto newly\nformed black holes; the observed sources are instead likely due to accretion of\nthe turbulent, convective envelope of the supergiant progenitor."}

In this work, for the first\ntime, we present a novel consistency test of CDDR by combining HII galaxy data\nwith a comprehensive set of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements.\nThe BAO measurements include two-dimensional (2D) BAO and three-dimensional\n(3D) BAO, as well as the latest 3D BAO data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic\nInstrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2). We adopt four different\nparameterizations of the CDDR parameter, $\\eta(z)$, to investigate possible\ndeviations and their evolution with cosmic time. To ensure accurate redshift\nmatching across datasets, we reconstruct the distance measures through a\nmodel-independent Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach. Our analysis\nuniquely examines two distinct approaches: $i)$ marginalization over the BAO\nsound horizon $r_d$, and $ii)$ fixing $r_d$ to specific values. We find no\nsignificant deviation from the CDDR (less than 68% confidence level) in either\nthe marginalized $r_d$ or the $r_d=147.05$ Mpc scenario. However, a slight\ndeviation at the 68% confidence level is found when applying 2D-BAO data with\n$r_d=139.5$ Mpc. Furthermore, our analysis shows that all BAO data considered\nin this work support the validity of the CDDR, where 3D-DESI BAO provides the\ntightest constraints. We find no tension between 2D and 3D BAO measurements,\nwhich confirms their mutual consistency. In addition, the treatment of the\nsound horizon $r_d$ significantly impacts $\\eta(z)$ constraints, which proves\nits importance in CDDR tests.

Github repo available\n  at https://github.com/slibanore/oLIMpus", "summary": "Line-intensity mapping (LIM) is emerging as a powerful probe of the\nhigh-redshift Universe, with a growing number of LIM experiments targeting\nvarious spectral lines deep into the epochs of reionization and cosmic dawn. A\nkey remaining challenge is the consistent and efficient modeling of the diverse\nemission lines and of the observables of different surveys. Here, we present\noLIMpus, a fully analytical effective model to study LIM auto- and cross- power\nspectra. Our work builds on the 21-cm effective model presented in Zeus21,\napplying it to star-forming lines and improving it in different aspects. Our\ncode accounts for shot noise and linear redshift-space distortions and it\nincludes by default prescriptions for OII, OIII, H$\\alpha$, H$\\beta$, CII, CO\nline luminosities, together with the 21-cm model inherited from Zeus21. Beyond\nauto- and cross-power spectra, oLIMpus can produce mock coeval boxes and\nlightcones, and with a computational time of $\\sim s$ it is ideal for\nparameter-space exploration and inference. Its modular implementation makes it\neasy to customize and extend, enabling various applications, such as MCMC\nanalyses and consistent multi-line cross-correlations."}

Although recent studies with fast radio bursts (FRBs)\nhave largely addressed this discrepancy, the precise spatial distribution of\nthese baryons remains uncertain due to the effect of galaxy feedback.\nCosmological hydrodynamical simulations such as Simba have shown that the\npartitioning of baryons between the intergalactic medium (IGM) and haloes is\nsensitive to feedback models, motivating the connection of baryon distribution\nwith feedback physics. With the Simba simulation suite, this study investigates\nhow feedback affects the distribution of matter within large-scale cosmic\nstructures, with implications for FRB foreground modeling. We apply the T-web\nmethod to classify the cosmic web into different structures: knots, filaments,\nsheets, and voids. We then analyze how the different feedback variants of Simba\naffect the distribution of matter within each structure. Our results show that\nin Simba, the fractions of IGM gas in different cosmic web structures vary only\na few percent under different feedback models.

In this scenario, a\nfirst generation of BHs resulting from collapsing stars form in a dense\nenvironment. Here they can assemble dynamically and undergo subsequent mergers.\nWe discuss three challenges for the formation of a GW231123-like event inside a\nstar cluster: 1) The high masses of the incoming BHs appear to be in the\npredicted pair-instability mass gap and thus suggest that second-generation or\nhigher-order generation BHs are involved. 2) Very high spins ($\\chi_f \\gtrsim\n0.8$) are very unlikely for dynamically assembled BHs because of the isotropic\ndistribution of spin vectors. 3) Hierarchically formed BHs are susceptible to\nreceive large recoils, which could kick them out of their cluster. We simulate\nthis scenario and show that only a few percent of mergers recover remnants\nwithin GW231123's primary spin estimate $\\chi_1=0.9^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and are\nretained inside typical star clusters. A large fraction of very rapidly\nspinning second-generation BHs (including $\\chi_f>0.9$) can only form if the\nfirst-generation BHs merges with aligned spins. This is a natural outcome of\nmassive binary star evolution scenarios, such as a chemically homogeneous\nevolution. This scenario also predicts equal masses for the components,\nimplying that the resulting BHs tend to receive very low recoil kicks and would\ntherefore likely be retained inside a cluster. We conclude that GW231123-like\nevents, if formed in a star cluster, could require first-generation BHs with\nlarge aligned spins that evolved through stellar binary interaction, followed\nby the dynamical assembly for a subsequent merger.

If this is a genuine signal, it could be\nexplained by theories of Chern--Simons-type coupled to electromagnetism, which\ncould lead to a harmonic scale-dependent birefringence signal, if the\nhypothesis of an ultra-light (pseudo) scalar field does not hold. To\ninvestigate these models, we pursue two complementary approaches: first, we fit\nthe birefringence angle estimated at different multipoles, $\\beta_{\\ell}$, with\na power-law model and second, we perform a non-parametric Bayesian\nreconstruction of it. Both methods yield results consistent with a\nnon-vanishing constant birefringence angle.

We detect no gamma-ray excess in the direction of\nNGC 4151, and we derive constraining upper limits on the VHE gamma-ray flux.\nThe integral flux upper limit (at the 95% confidence level) above 200 GeV is $f\n= 2.3 \\times 10^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The comparison of the MAGIC and\nIceCube measurements suggests the presence of a gamma-ray obscured accelerator,\nand it allows us to constrain the gamma-ray optical depth and the size of the\nneutrino production site."}

The non-parametric Lynden-Bell's c$^{-}$ method has been applied to\nget the cumulative luminosity function and event rate which is compared with\nthe star formation history. How the selection and instrument effects bias the\ndeduced event rate has been carefully studied. We find that the event rate\nalways exceeds the star formation rate (SFR) at lower redshift and matches with\neach other at higher redshift, which is independent of energy bands and\nconsistent with previous findings of other satellites. Furthermore, it is found\nthat sample completeness does not affect the deduced event rate too much as\nmentioned for the Swift lGRBs in Dong et al.. A triple power-law function has\nbeen used to fit the cumulative flux distribution and categorize the total\nsample into three subsamples of bright, medium and faint GRBs.

The\nrare properties are the SN Ia ejecta interacting with a carbon-oxygen (CO)-rich\ncircumstellar material (CSM) at approximately 50 days post-explosion. In this\nDD-MED scenario, two massive CO white dwarfs (WDs), masses of M1=1.1Mo and\nM2=1, merge to leave a rapidly rotating lonely WD of about the Chandrasekhar\nmass. The merger process ejects 0.7Mo to form a nonspherical CO-rich CSM. At\nthe explosion, there is a lonely WD and a detached hydrogen- and\nhelium-deficient CSM. Studies proposed the other lonely WD scenario, the\ncore-degenerate (CD) scenario, to explain several specific SNe Ia and SN Ia\nremnants. SN 2020aeuh is the first particular SN Ia that is attributed to the\nDD-MED scenario. Besides being slightly brighter than typical SNe Ia and the\nCSM interaction, SN 2020aeuh is a normal SN Ia. Therefore, this study\nstrengthens the claim that the lonely WD scenarios, i.e., the DD-MED and CD\nscenarios, account for most, if not all, normal SNe Ia; all SN Ia scenarios,\nwhether lonely WD or not, might contribute to peculiar SNe Ia."}

Github repo available\n  at https://github.com/slibanore/oLIMpus", "summary": "Line-intensity mapping (LIM) is emerging as a powerful probe of the\nhigh-redshift Universe, with a growing number of LIM experiments targeting\nvarious spectral lines deep into the epochs of reionization and cosmic dawn. A\nkey remaining challenge is the consistent and efficient modeling of the diverse\nemission lines and of the observables of different surveys. Here, we present\noLIMpus, a fully analytical effective model to study LIM auto- and cross- power\nspectra. Our work builds on the 21-cm effective model presented in Zeus21,\napplying it to star-forming lines and improving it in different aspects. Our\ncode accounts for shot noise and linear redshift-space distortions and it\nincludes by default prescriptions for OII, OIII, H$\\alpha$, H$\\beta$, CII, CO\nline luminosities, together with the 21-cm model inherited from Zeus21. Beyond\nauto- and cross-power spectra, oLIMpus can produce mock coeval boxes and\nlightcones, and with a computational time of $\\sim s$ it is ideal for\nparameter-space exploration and inference. Its modular implementation makes it\neasy to customize and extend, enabling various applications, such as MCMC\nanalyses and consistent multi-line cross-correlations."}

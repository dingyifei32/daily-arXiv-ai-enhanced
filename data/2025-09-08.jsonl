The presence of DM reduces the number of twin or hybrid stars\ncompared to the case without DM, and this effect directly depends on the DM\nmass and fraction. We further find that the formation of DM-core or DM-halo\nconfigurations is mainly governed by DM parameters, whereas the realization of\ntwin or hybrid star scenarios is primarily controlled by quark parameters.\nUsing the $2M_\\odot$ constraint, we demonstrate that the parameter space for\ntwin stars can be further restricted in both DM-core and DM-halo scenarios."}

Since the start of data collection almost two decades ago,\nnumerous searches for photons have been conducted using the detection systems\nof the Observatory. These searches have led to the most stringent upper limits\non the diffuse photon flux. These limits place severe constraints on current\nmodels regarding the origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and emphasize the\nsignificant capabilities of the Pierre Auger Observatory in the context of\nmultimessenger astronomy at the highest energies. This contribution provides an\noverview of the ongoing efforts to search for high-energy photons in the data\nfrom the Pierre Auger Observatory. The latest results from searches for the\ndiffuse photon flux will be presented, along with follow-up investigations for\nphotons associated with transient events, such as gravitational wave\ndetections. Furthermore, future prospects will be discussed in light of the\nongoing AugerPrime detector upgrade, which will enhance the sensitivity of the\nObservatory to photons up to the highest energies."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "We report the milliarcsecond localization of a high (1379 pc/cc) dispersion\nmeasure (DM) repeating fast radio burst, FRB 20190417A. Combining European VLBI\nNetwork detections of five repeat bursts, we confirm the FRB's host to be a\nlow-metallicity, star-forming dwarf galaxy at z = 0.12817, analogous to the\nhosts of FRBs 20121102A, 20190520B and 20240114A. We also show that FRB\n20190417A is spatially coincident with a compact, luminous persistent radio\nsource (PRS). Visibility-domain model fitting constrains the transverse\nphysical size of the PRS to < 23.1 pc and yields an integrated flux density of\n191(39) microJy at 1.4 GHz. Though we do not find significant evidence for DM\nevolution, FRB 20190417A exhibits a time-variable rotation measure (RM) ranging\nbetween +3958(11) and +5061(24) rad/m2 over three years. We find no evidence\nfor intervening galaxy clusters in the FRB's line-of-sight and place a\nconservative lower limit on the rest-frame host DM contribution of 1212.0 pc/cc\n(90% confidence) -- the largest known for any FRB so far. This system\nstrengthens the emerging picture of a rare subclass of repeating FRBs with\nlarge and variable RMs, above-average host DMs, and luminous PRS counterparts\nin metal-poor dwarf galaxies. We explore the role of these systems in the\nbroader FRB population, either as the youngest or most extreme FRB sources, or\nas a distinct engine for FRB emission."}

We conduct a spectro-polarimetric analysis combining IXPE data with\narchival Chandra, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and Swift observations. We explore two\nlimiting magnetic field configurations, parallel and perpendicular to the bulk\nflow, and simulate their expected polarization signatures using the {\\tt 3DPol}\nradiative transport code. To account for the rapid rotation of the polarization\nangle predicted by these models, we implement a phase-dependent Stokes\nalignment procedure that preserves the polarization degree while correcting for\nphase-rotating PA. We also devise a new maximum-likelihood fitting strategy to\ndetermine the phase-dependence of the polarization angle by minimizing the\npolarization degree uncertainty. This technique shows a hint the binary may be\nrotating clockwise relative to the celestial north pole. We find no significant\ndetection of polarization in the IXPE data, with PD<51% at 99% confidence\nlevel. Our results excludes the high-polarization degree scenario predicted by\nthe perpendicular field model during the brightest orbital phase bin.\nSimulations show that doubling the current exposure would make the parallel\nconfiguration detectable. The new PA rotation technique is also applicable to\nIXPE data of many sources whose intrinsic PA variation is apriori not known but\nis strictly periodic."}

TL;DR: SN 2023uqf, a Type Ibn supernova coinciding with high-energy neutrino IC231004A, provides evidence for supernovae as cosmic hadron accelerators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify the origin of high-energy neutrinos by linking them to supernovae.

Method: Systematic optical follow-up with the Zwicky Transient Facility, analyzing lightcurve and spectroscopic data.

Result: SN 2023uqf's interaction with a dense circumstellar medium supports neutrino production theories.

Conclusion: First observational evidence that interacting supernovae can accelerate hadrons, validating long-held theories.

Abstract: Astrophysical high-energy (TeV-PeV) neutrinos were first discovered in 2013,
but their origin remains largely unknown. Here we present SN 2023uqf, a
supernova found in coincidence with high-energy neutrino IC231004A, as part of
a systematic optical follow-up program with the Zwicky Transient Facility. SN
2023uqf had a luminous and rapidly-evolving lightcurve, and spectroscopic
observations indicated that the source was a Type Ibn supernova. Spectroscopic
signatures confirm ongoing interaction between the supernova ejecta and a dense
circumstellar medium, as expected for high-energy neutrino production in a
core-collapse supernova. Given the rare nature of Type Ibn supernovae, SN
2023uqf is unlikely to have been discovered by chance over the course of our
program (p=0.3%). Our discovery of SN 2023uqf provides the first observational
evidence to support long-held theories that interacting supernovae can serve as
cosmic hadron accelerators.

TL;DR: 通过eROSITA-DE数据发现9个潮汐撕裂事件候选体，其中5个为新发现，X射线光谱符合软热辐射特征，部分有光学或红外对应体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究潮汐撕裂事件（TDE）的多样性和特征，尤其是超软X射线热暂现源。

Method: 通过eROSITA-DE数据筛选超软源，结合Swift观测和公开数据验证候选体性质。

Result: 发现9个TDE候选体，5个为新发现；X射线光谱为软热辐射；部分有光学或红外对应体。

Conclusion: 超软X射线谱可能与红外对应体相关，宿主星系与一般TDE宿主相似。

Abstract: Tidal disruption events are rare and diverse transients that occur when a
star is torn apart by a supermassive black hole and accreted, which can result
in a supersoft X-ray thermal transient. Here, we present nine tidal disruption
event (TDE) candidates identified in eROSITA-DE Data Release 1 through a novel
search for such supersoft sources. We select candidates by comparing the
catalogued count rates in several combinations of bands and evaluate the nature
of selected sources to produce our sample, among which five are entirely new
X-ray TDE candidates. All our candidates' X-ray spectra are consistent with
soft thermal emission and we show them to have faded through additional Swift
observations and catalogued data. We investigate publicly available data from
ground- and space-based telescopes and find two of our sources have optical
counterparts and four sources show flaring in their NEOWISE IR light curves.
The high proportion of our sources with IR flares compared to optically
selected TDE samples could suggest a link between supersoft X-ray spectra and
IR counterparts. We fit the IR light curves with a model of a spherical dust
shell heated by the TDE and find these results to be broadly consistent with
those of other TDEs with IR counterparts. Finally, we examine the host galaxies
and show them to be similar to the general TDE host population.

### [3] [Investigation of Electromagnetic and Muonic Air-Shower Components using IceTop Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08478)
*Lincoln Draper,Fahim Varsi,Dennis Soldin*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: IceTop通过双分量横向分布函数（LDF）重建宇宙射线引发的广延大气簇射（EAS）中的电磁和μ子成分，验证了其准确性，并研究了强子相互作用模型对重建结果的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究IceTop表面阵列对EAS中电磁和μ子成分的测量能力，并探索强子相互作用模型对重建参数的影响。

Method: 采用双分量LDF重建方法，分别拟合电磁和μ子成分的横向分布，分析不同强子相互作用模型下的重建结果。

Result: 验证了双分量LDF重建μ子分布的准确性，发现重建参数显著依赖于强子相互作用模型的选择。

Conclusion: 双分量LDF重建方法有效，但需考虑强子相互作用模型的不确定性。

Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory studies cosmic-ray initiated extensive air
showers (EASs) using the IceTop surface array, which is sensitive to the
electromagnetic component and low-energy ($\sim$ GeV) muonic component of EASs.
The contribution from the two components is reconstructed on an event-by-event
basis by simultaneously fitting separate lateral distribution functions (LDFs)
for both the electromagnetic and muonic components of each shower. In this
work, we demonstrate the ability of the two-component LDF reconstruction to
recreate the muon distribution in IceTop accurately. The parameters
characterizing the reconstructed muonic LDF can vary significantly based on the
choice of hadronic interaction model. Thus, the dependence of the reconstructed
muon LDF and other parameters on the hadronic interaction models is
investigated.

*Xiaohong Tang,Hua Feng*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文研究了超临界吸积系统的光学特性，发现其光学辐射范围广泛，部分系统表现出类似B型主序星的谱线，且存在短时标变异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨超临界吸积系统的光学辐射特性，以验证其与X射线辐射的关系及多样性。

Method: 通过识别光学对应体，比较超临界吸积系统与超亮X射线源的光学特性。

Result: 光学亮度范围广，部分系统谱线呈幂律或黑体形状，存在短时标变异性。

Conclusion: 超临界吸积系统具有多样性，未来需进一步光学光谱观测以确定其性质。

Abstract: Supercritical accretion onto compact objects is expected to drive optically
thick winds, resulting in observed X-ray emission as a function of viewing
angle. However, their optical emission, either from the outer accretion disk or
companion surface tends to be nearly isotropic. Based on a sample of luminous
and very soft X-ray sources that are argued to be supercritical accretion
systems viewed close to edge-on, we identified the optical counterparts for
some of them and compared the optical properties with those of ultraluminous
X-ray sources (ULXs), which are supposed to be supercritical accretion systems
viewed close to face-on. The optical luminosity is found in a wide range, with
the absolute visual magnitude ranging from dimmer than -1.2 in some sources to
about -7 in one case. Most sources show a power-law like spectrum while four of
them display a blackbody shape. One of them shows an optical spectrum
resembling a B type main sequence, suggesting that it may be a Be white dwarf
system. Strong variability in flux at timescales as short as 10 days are
revealed, indicating that some of these sources are powered by accretion onto
compact objects. These suggest that the luminous and very soft X-ray sources in
nearby galaxies have a diverse population, and some of them are indeed
consistent with emission from supercritical accretion, with consistent optical
magnitudes and colors. Future optical spectroscopic observations are needed to
further constrain their natures.

### [5] [Accretion is All You Need: Black Hole Spin Alignment in Merger GW231123 Indicates Accretion Pathway](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08558)
*Imre Bartos,Zoltan Haiman*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: GW231123是目前探测到的最大的双黑洞合并事件，质量位于甚至超过不稳定性质量间隙，其高自旋难以通过重复合并解释。研究表明黑洞自旋向量相互对齐但显著倾斜于轨道角动量，指向共同的气体吸积起源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨高自旋、高质量双黑洞的形成机制，尤其是GW231123这类极端事件。

Method: 分析黑洞自旋向量与轨道角动量的关系，研究可能的形成通道，如活动星系核盘和Pop III遗迹中的气体吸积。

Result: GW231123的自旋特征表明其可能通过持续的、非对齐的气体吸积形成，类似事件如GW190521可能共享相同演化路径。

Conclusion: 持续的、相干的气体吸积在塑造极端双黑洞系统中起关键作用。

Abstract: GW231123 represents the most massive binary-black-hole merger detected to
date, lying firmly within, or even above, the pair-instability mass gap. The
component spins are both exceptionally high ($a_1 = 0.90^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$, $a_2
= 0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.51}$), which is difficult to explain with repeated mergers.
Here we show that the black hole spin vectors are closely aligned with each
other while significantly tilted relative to the binary's orbital angular
momentum, pointing to a common accretion-driven origin. We examine
astrophysical formation channels capable of producing near-equal, high-mass,
and mutually aligned spins consistent with GW231123 -- particularly binaries
embedded in AGN disks and Pop~III remnants, which grew via coherent misaligned
gas accretion. We further argue that other high-mass, high-spin events, e.g.,
GW190521 may share a similar evolutionary pathway. These findings underscore
the critical role of sustained, coherent accretion in shaping the most extreme
black hole binaries.

### [6] [Possible detection of HFQPOs associated with 'unknown' variability class of GRS 1915+105](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08594)
*Seshadri Majumder,Santabrata Das,Anuj Nandi*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 对GRS 1915+105的全面时频分析，发现新的变异性类别τ，并检测到高频准周期振荡（HFQPO）特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GRS 1915+105的变异性类别及其物理机制。

Method: 利用AstroSat观测数据，进行时频分析和宽带光谱建模。

Result: 发现新的τ类别，检测到71 Hz和152 Hz的HFQPO特征，并确定其能量范围和物理参数。

Conclusion: τ类别为GRS 1915+105的独特变异性类别，HFQPO特征可能与冷而厚的康普顿化冕相关。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive spectro-temporal analysis of GRS $1915+105$
observed with AstroSat during June, $2017$. A detailed study of the temporal
properties reveals the appearance of an `unknown' variability class ($\tau$)
during $\rho \rightarrow \kappa$ class transition of the source. This new
`unknown' class ($\tau$) is characterized by the irregular repetition of low
count `dips' along with the adjacent `flare' like features in between two
successive steady count rate durations, resulting in uniform `$C$' shaped
distribution in the color-color diagram. A detailed comparative study of the
variability properties between the $\tau$ class and other known variability
classes of GRS $1915+105$ indicates it as a distinct variability class of the
source. Further, we find evidence of the presence of possible HFQPO features at
$\sim 71$ Hz with quality factor $\sim 13$, rms amplitude $\sim 4.69\%$, and
significance $3\sigma$, respectively. In addition, a harmonic-like feature at
$\sim 152$ Hz is also seen with quality factor $\sim 21$, rms amplitude $\sim
5.75\%$ and significance $\sim 4.7\sigma$. The energy-dependent power spectral
study reveals that the fundamental HFQPO and its harmonic are present in $3-15$
keV and $3-6$ keV energy ranges, respectively. Moreover, the wide-band
($0.7-50$ keV) spectral modelling comprising of thermal Comptonization
component indicates the presence of a cool ($kT_{\rm e}\sim 1.7$ keV) and
optically thick (optical depth $\sim 14$) Comptonizing `corona', which seems to
be responsible in regulating the HFQPO features in GRS $1915$+$105$. Finally,
we find the bolometric luminosity ($L_{\rm bol}$) to be about $42\% L_{\rm
Edd}$ within $1-100$ keV, indicating the sub-Eddington accretion regime of the
source.

TL;DR: 通过十年观测数据，改进了12颗脉冲星的旋转和天体测量参数，精度显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 已知慢脉冲星的坐标和旋转参数不精确，需改进。

Method: 利用LPA LPI望远镜的存档数据，结合Pulsar Timescale算法补偿时间误差。

Result: 旋转频率及其导数精度提升5-6个数量级，坐标精度达角秒级。

Conclusion: 观测方法和算法显著提升了脉冲星参数的测量精度。

Abstract: We have performed timing of a number of known slow pulsars with poorly known
coordinates and parameters of their intrinsic rotation. We used data from the
archive of round-the-clock monitoring observations on the third (stationary)
beam pattern of the Large Phased Array radio telescope (LPA LPI) at a frequency
of 111 MHz, which has an unsatisfactory connection of the local quartz time
standards to the reference scale (UTC). To compensate for the resulting errors,
we applied an algorithm previously developed by us, which uses Pulsar Timescale
as an intermediate reference scale to compute corrections to the pulses Times
of Arrival (TOAs) measured by the local clocks and to switch to UTC. Analyzing
a ten-year observational data set we substantially refined the rotational and
astrometric parameters of 12 pulsars. The spin frequencies $\nu$ and their
first derivatives $\dot\nu$ were determined with accuracies of $10^{-10}$ Hz
and $10^{-19}$ s$^{-2}$, respectively, which is 5-6 orders of magnitude better
than the values quoted in the catalogue. The coordinates are determined with
accuracies ranging from units to tens of arcseconds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CORSIKA 7的局限性，提供更灵活的平台以适应新需求。

Method: 完全重写为模块化C++框架，支持多种物理模型（如Sibyll 2.3d、QGSJet-II.04等）。

Result: 首个“物理完整”版本已发布，支持跨介质粒子级联和高级无线电发射计算。

Conclusion: CORSIKA 8设计灵活，验证充分，适用于未来实验的多样化需求。

Abstract: CORSIKA 8 represents a significant update in the simulation of particle
showers, building on the well-established foundation of CORSIKA 7. It has been
entirely rewritten as a modular and modern C++ framework, addressing the
limitations of its predecessor to provide a flexible platform designed to
satisfy current and novel use cases. This allows for application beyond pure
air-shower scenarios such as cross-media particle cascades and an advanced
calculation of the radio emission. A first official "physics-complete" version
has already been released that supports the treatment of hadronic interactions
with Sibyll 2.3d, QGSJet-II.04, and EPOS-LHC and the treatment of the
electromagnetic cascade with PROPOSAL 7.6.2. In this presentation, we will
discuss the design principles, current functionality, and validation efforts of
CORSIKA 8, emphasizing its potential applications for future experiments.

TL;DR: 论文通过光学观测红背毫秒脉冲星PSR J2339-0533，发现其光学对应体在脉冲星自转频率上存在脉动信号，支持吸积盘能增强光学发射效率的观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索光学脉动信号是否独立于吸积盘存在，并验证吸积盘对光学发射效率的增强作用。

Method: 使用SiFAP2光度计在Telescopio Nazionale Galileo上进行光学观测，结合Parkes射电望远镜的脉冲星历表折叠光学时间序列。

Result: 检测到2.9-3.5σ显著性的光学脉动信号，脉动幅度为26.0±0.6 mag，转换效率与年轻孤立脉冲星相当，但低于吸积毫秒脉冲星。

Conclusion: 光学脉动信号可能独立于吸积盘，但吸积盘能显著提升光学发射效率。

Abstract: Recent detections of optical pulsations from both a transitional and an
accreting millisecond pulsar have revealed unexpectedly bright signals,
suggesting that the presence of an accretion disk enhances the efficiency of
optical emission, possibly via synchrotron radiation from accelerated
particles. In this work, we present optical observations of the redback
millisecond pulsar PSR J2339-0533, obtained with the SiFAP2 photometer mounted
on the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. Data accumulated during the campaign with
the longest exposure time (12 hr) suggest that its $\sim$18 mag optical
counterpart exhibits pulsations at the neutron star's spin frequency. This
candidate signal was identified by folding the optical time series using the
pulsar ephemeris derived from nearly simultaneous observations with the 64-m
Murriyang (Parkes) radio telescope. The detection significance of the candidate
optical signal identified in those data lies between 2.9 and 3.5 $\sigma$,
depending on the statistical test employed. The pulsed signal has a duty cycle
of $\approx 1/32$, and the de-reddened pulsed magnitude in the V band is $(26.0
\pm 0.6)$ mag. At a distance of 1.7 kpc, this corresponds to a conversion
efficiency of $\sim 3 \times 10^{-6}$ of the pulsar's spin-down power into
pulsed optical luminosity, comparable to values observed in young, isolated
pulsars like the Crab, but 50-100 times lower than in disk-accreting
millisecond pulsars. If confirmed, these findings suggest that optical
pulsations arise independently of an accretion disk and support the notion that
such disks boost the optical emission efficiency.

Motivation: 利用KM3NeT探测到的220 PeV高能中微子事件，结合多信使观测数据，研究超重暗物质（SHDM）的衰变性质及其对宇宙的贡献。

Method: 提出新似然框架，整合IceCube的中微子通量测量、Auger观测站的数据缺失以及伽马射线实验上限，系统性约束SHDM性质。

Result: 得出SHDM寿命下限为≳5×10²⁹-10³⁰秒，为迄今最严格约束，并首次发现银河系中微子通量测量对暗物质研究的关键作用。

Conclusion: 未来需重点研究银河系中心能量超过10 PeV的中微子，以探索宇宙线膝区起源及超重暗物质对宇宙的潜在贡献。

Abstract: Recently, the KM3NeT collaboration detected an astrophysical neutrino event,
KM3-230213A, with an energy of approximately $220~\rm PeV$, providing
unprecedented insights into the ultra-high-energy Universe. In this study, we
introduce a novel likelihood framework designed to leverage this event to
constrain the properties of super-heavy dark matter (SHDM) decay. Our approach
systematically integrates multi-messenger constraints from galactic and
extragalactic neutrino flux measurements by IceCube, the absence of comparable
neutrino events at IceCube and Auger observatories, and the latest gamma-ray
experiment upper limits. Our findings impose the most stringent constraints to
date, placing a lower bound on the SHDM lifetime at $\gtrsim 5\cdot
10^{29}-10^{30} \rm s$. Importantly, we identify, for the first time, the
significant potential of galactic neutrino flux measurements in advancing dark
matter research. Future investigations targeting astrophysical neutrinos
originating from the Galactic Center at energies above $10~\rm PeV$ will be
crucial, not only for understanding the origin of the cosmic-ray knee but also
for exploring the possible contributions of super-heavy dark matter to our
Universe.

Method: 在CORSIKA 8中实现并验证Pythia 8/Angantyr模型，比较其与其他模型在关键观测值和簇射特性上的表现。

Result: Pythia 8/Angantyr能够与其他高能相互作用模型相媲美，为簇射模拟提供了更多调优可能性。

Conclusion: Pythia 8/Angantyr的加入增强了CORSIKA 8的功能，有助于进一步研究高能簇射中的强子相互作用。

Abstract: The simulation of extensive air showers is pivotal for advancing our
understanding of high-energy cosmic ray interactions in Earth's atmosphere. The
CORSIKA 8 framework is being developed as a modern, flexible, and efficient
tool for simulating these interactions with a variety of high-energy hadronic
models. We present the ongoing implementation and validation of Pythia
8/Angantyr within CORSIKA 8. Pythia 8, successfully used in collider physics,
provides a detailed and well-tested treatment of hadronic interactions, while
the Angantyr model extends its capabilities to describe heavy-ion collisions in
a consistent manner. With the inclusion of Pythia 8, the CORSIKA 8 suite now
enables further tuning possibilities, improving the exploration of hadronic
interactions in air showers.
  In this contribution, we compare the capability of Pythia 8/Angantyr to
reproduce fundamental observables of high-energy particle collisions $-$
inelastic cross-sections and multiplicities $-$ to that of several established
high-energy interaction models in air shower simulations. We further compare
the predictions for key air shower properties, including longitudinal shower
development and muon content, for iron-induced shower.

Abstract: The detection by the Carpet-3 Group of a 300 TeV photon, observed 4536
seconds after the prompt emission of the historic gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A,
provides unprecedented opportunities to test Lorentz invariance violation (LV)
at energy scales approaching the Planck regime. By analyzing the temporal and
spatial properties of this ultra-high-energy photon in conjunction with
lower-energy photons from other bursts and the same burst, we demonstrate
consistency with subluminal LV scenarios characterized by an energy scale \(
E_{\rm LV} \sim 3 \times 10^{17} \, \rm{GeV} \). This work bridges multi-year
LV studies using GeV-TeV photons and establishes GRB 221009A as a pivotal
laboratory for quantum spacetime phenomenology.

Motivation: 研究Gaia和LVK观测到的致密天体质量分布差异，尤其是质量间隙的显著程度不同。

Method: 比较Gaia和GW前身双星在不同诞生踢强度和超新星前双星参数下的存活概率。

Result: GW前身双星更可能存活，因其伴星质量更大或轨道更紧密。

Conclusion: 诞生踢强度和前身双星参数解释了Gaia和LVK观测到的质量分布差异。

Abstract: Gaia has recently revealed a population of over 20 compact objects in wide
astrometric binaries, while LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) have observed around 100
compact object binaries as gravitational-wave (GW) mergers. Despite belonging
to different systems, the compact objects discovered by both Gaia and the LVK
follow a multimodal mass distribution, with a global maximum at neutron star
(NS) masses ($\sim 1$-$2\,M_\odot$) and a secondary local maximum at black hole
(BH) masses $\sim10\,M_\odot$. However, the relative dearth of objects, or
``mass gap," between these modes is more pronounced among the wide binaries
observed by Gaia compared to the GW population, with $9^{+10}_{-6}\%$ of GW
component masses falling between $2.5$--$5\,M_\odot$ compared to $\lesssim5\%$
of Gaia compact objects. We explore whether this discrepancy can be explained
by the natal kicks received by low-mass BHs. GW progenitor binaries may be more
likely to survive natal kicks, because the newborn BH has a more massive
companion and/or is in a tighter binary than Gaia progenitor binaries. We
compare the survival probabilities of Gaia and GW progenitor binaries as a
function of natal kick strength and pre-supernova binary parameters, and map
out the parameter space and kick strength required to disrupt the progenitor
binaries leading to low-mass BHs in Gaia systems more frequently than those in
GW systems.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了伽马射线暴（GRBs）的分类问题，提出最小变时标（MVT）作为关键指标，并分析了其与GRB起源的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的GRB分类基于持续时间，但某些事件表明这种分类可能不准确。MVT被视为更可靠的分类指标。

Method: 使用MEPSA算法计算GRB光变曲线中最窄脉冲的半高全宽（FWHM）作为MVT，分析了3700个GRB的数据。

Conclusion: MVT虽不能单独确定GRB起源，但结合其他指标可有效区分长时合并事件和MGFs。

Abstract: Context. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have traditionally been classified by
duration into long (LGRBs) and short (SGRBs), with the former believed to
originate from massive star collapses and the latter from compact binary
mergers. However, events such as the SGRB 200826A (coming from a collapsar) and
the LGRBs 211211A and 230307A (associated with a merger) suggest that
duration-based classification could be sometimes misleading. Recently, the
minimum variability timescale (MVT) has emerged as a key metric for classifying
GRBs.
  Aims. We calculate the MVT, defined as the full width at half maximum (FWHM)
of the narrowest pulse in the light curve, using an independent dataset from
Fermi/GBM and we compare our results with other MVT definitions. We update the
MVT-T90 plane and analyse peculiar events like long-duration merger candidates
211211A, 230307A, and other short GRBs with extended emission (SEE-GRBs). We
also examine extragalactic magnetar giant flares (MGFs) and explore possible
new correlations with peak energy.
  Methods. We used the MEPSA algorithm to identify the shortest pulse in each
GRB light curve and measure its FWHM. We calculated the MVT for around 3700
GRBs, 177 of which with spectroscopically known redshift.
  Results. SEE-GRBs and SGRBs share similar MVTs (from few tens to a few
hundreds of ms), indicating a common progenitor, while extragalactic MGFs
exhibit even shorter values (from few ms to few tens of ms). Our MVT estimation
method consistently yields higher values than another existing technique, the
latter aligning with the pulse rise time. For LGRBs, we confirmed the
correlations of MVT with peak luminosity and Lorentz factor.
  Conclusions. We confirmed that, although MVT alone cannot determine the GRB
progenitor, it is a valuable tool when combined with other indicators, helping
to flag long-duration mergers and distinguish MGFs from typical SGRBs.

Motivation: 通过结合不同能量范围的中微子数据和引力波事件，提高对天体物理源的探测灵敏度，并探索多信使天文学的可能性。

Method: 1. 使用高能轨迹和低能轨迹/级联两个中微子数据集进行联合似然搜索；2. 首次利用能量高于1 TeV的级联样本进行中微子-引力波发射搜索。

Result: 展示了两种分析的结果，并讨论了实时分析的潜力。

Conclusion: 通过多信使方法扩展了中微子探测的能力，为未来的实时分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole detects neutrinos of
astrophysical origin via their interactions with ice. The main array is
optimized for the detection of neutrinos with energies above 1 TeV. A much
smaller infill array, known as IceCube DeepCore, extends the sensitivity down
to a few GeV. Neutrinos observed in both parts of the detector are used for
astrophysical-source searches with multiple messengers. We present two analyses
that follow up archival gravitational wave (GW) events from runs O1 through O3
of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. The first analysis uses two neutrino datasets: one with
high-energy tracks and another consisting of low-energy tracks and cascades.
These two neutrino datasets were previously used independently to follow-up GW
events. In the analysis presented here, a combined likelihood search is
performed using both datasets to search for neutrinos coincident with the GW
events across a wide energy range, from a few GeV to several PeV. The second
analysis, for the first time, uses a neutrino-induced cascade sample with
events of energy above ~1 TeV for searches of coincident neutrino-GW emission.
We present results from both analyses and discuss prospects for conducting
these analyses in real time.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的解析动力学平衡态，用于模拟克尔黑洞周围的无碰撞环，并成功在GPU框架中实现，为未来研究无碰撞吸积和喷流提供了理想起点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光度活动星系核（如M87*和Sgr A*）中的吸积流处于无碰撞状态，传统方法难以模拟带电粒子的能量化和辐射。

Method: 采用全局广义相对论粒子-单元模拟（GRPIC）方法，首次提出了一类解析动力学平衡态的无碰撞环模型。

Result: 在无初始磁场的二维轴对称模拟中，这些无碰撞环能稳定存在数百至数千个动力学时间尺度。

Conclusion: 这些动力学平衡态为未来研究无碰撞吸积和喷流物理提供了重要基础。

Abstract: In low luminosity active galactic nuclei like M87$^*$ and Sgr A$^*$, the
accretion flow in the vicinity of the black hole is in the collisionless
regime, meaning that the collisional mean free path of charged particles is
much larger than the dynamic length scales. To properly model the particle
energization and emission from the collisionless accretion flow, a promising
approach is to employ the global general relativistic particle-in-cell
simulations -- a newly developed, fully kinetic, first-principles method.
However, it has been challenging to set up an initial condition that involves
collisionless gas with finite angular momentum. We present, for the first time,
a class of analytic kinetic equilibria of collisionless tori around a Kerr
black hole. We have successfully implemented the collisionless tori in our
GPU-based GRPIC code framework Aperture, and found them to be stable for
hundreds to thousands of dynamical times in 2D axisymmetric simulations when
there is no initial seed magnetic field. These kinetic equilibria serve as
ideal starting points for future studies of the physics of collisionless
accretion and jet launching.

Motivation: 研究目的是比较标准模型与修正引力模型下物质扰动的演化，并利用PINN方法改进传统数值方法的局限性。

Method: 使用PINN方法求解物质扰动演化方程，结合网络输出和残差计算误差界限，无需依赖数值解。

Result: 通过更新数据集，在Ωm-σ8平面上获得了比以往更严格的约束条件。

Conclusion: PINN方法在宇宙学扰动研究中具有潜力，能够提供更精确的误差界限和参数约束。

Abstract: We consider the evolution of linear matter perturbations in the context of
the standard cosmological model ($\Lambda$CDM) and a phenomenological modified
gravity model. We use the physics-informed neural network (PINN) bundle method,
which allows to integrate differential systems as an alternative to the
traditional numerical method. We apply the PINN bundle method to the equation
that describes the matter perturbation evolution, to compare its outcomes with
recent data on structure growth, $f\sigma_8$. Unlike our previous works, we can
calculate a bound on the error of this observable without using the numerical
solution of the equation. For this, we use a method developed previously by
ourselves to calculate an exact bound on the PINN-based solution using only the
outcomes of the network and its residual. On the other hand, the use of an
updated data set allows us to obtain more stringent constraints on the plane
$\Omega_m-\sigma_8$ than previous works.

Result: 发现线性混合会引发引力波谱的振荡特征，宇称破坏算子则可能产生手性特征。

Conclusion: 这些结果为未来引力波探测器提供了模型无关的关键特征和观测意义。

Abstract: Spectator fields which provide additional tensor degrees of freedom, on top
of the standard metric tensor perturbations, can produce significant amounts of
gravitational waves (GWs). Employing the effective field theory approach for
spin-2 fields, we find a universal prediction that linear mixing between the
metric and extra tensor modes inevitably induces oscillatory features in the GW
spectrum, reminiscent of the so-called neutrino oscillation. Moreover,
parity-violating operators in the spin-2 sector can imprint chiral signatures
on the resulting GW background. We consider a concrete scenario in which the
spin-2 field generates observable chiral GWs with characteristic oscillatory
patterns. These results provide a model-independent characterization of the key
signatures and observational implications of such scenarios which can be
detected with future GW detectors.

Method: 通过将场方程重构为自治动力系统，分析宇宙的长期行为（辐射、物质和暗能量主导时期），并使用观测数据（包括Roman Space Telescope的模拟高红移测量）约束模型参数。

Result: 两种势能模型均与当前数据高度一致，接近ΛCDM模型的预测，但仍存在细微差异，可供未来观测验证。

Conclusion: 该框架为暗能量与暗物质的耦合提供了新视角，同时保留了与ΛCDM模型的一致性，未来观测可能揭示更多细节。

Abstract: We explore a cosmological framework in which a Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupled
scalar field, acting as dark energy, interacts with a fermionic dark matter
field through a coupling obtained from the point of view of particle physics.
This setup is inspired by string/M-theory, and two representative scalar field
potentials are investigated: exponential and power-law. A distinctive feature
of the GB-coupled models is their potential to alter the propagation speed of
gravitational waves (GWs), a property with significant implications in light of
recent multi-messenger astrophysical observations. To account for this, we
analyze models under two scenarios: one where the GW speed differs from that of
light and the other where they are equal, but all consistent with current
observational constraints. The dynamical evolution of the system is
investigated by reformulating the field equations into an autonomous dynamical
system, enabling a detailed analysis of the Universe's long-term behavior,
including the radiation-, matter- and dark energy-dominated epochs. We
constrain the model parameters using a broad set of recent observational data,
including mock high-redshift measurements from the Roman Space Telescope. Our
findings indicate that both potentials yield cosmologies that are in excellent
agreement with current data, closely tracking the expansion history predicted
by the standard \(\Lambda\)CDM model, while still allowing room for subtle
deviations that could be tested by future observations.

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 论文通过宇宙流体动力学模拟研究了类星体在晕质量、红移和光度下的分布特性，发现类星体活动在特定晕质量尺度（约10^13 M⊙）下被抑制，且低红移时更明显。忽略这种抑制会导致重构宿主晕质量分布时出现显著偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究类星体在宇宙中的分布及其与宿主晕质量的关系，探讨类星体活动的抑制机制及其对观测数据的影响。

Method: 使用IllustrisTNG和SIMBA宇宙流体动力学模拟，分析类星体的晕占据分布（HOD）随红移、光度和黑洞质量的变化。

Result: 类星体活动在特定晕质量下被抑制，低红移时更明显；忽略抑制效应会导致重构宿主晕质量分布时出现显著偏差；卫星类星体比例随红移降低单调增加。

Conclusion: 类星体的分布受红移、光度和反馈模式影响，但超大质量黑洞的分布在整个参数空间中保持稳定，符合幂律和阶跃函数模型。

Abstract: We use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (IllustrisTNG and SIMBA) to
explore the redshift, luminosity, and black hole mass dependence of the quasar
halo occupation distribution (HOD). In both simulations, we find that the
quasar activity is quenched at a characteristic halo mass ($\sim 10^{13}
M_{\odot}$) scale affecting the nature of its occupation distribution function.
We note that the quenching is more pronounced at low redshifts for quasars
selected through a luminosity threshold. We show that a very significant bias
({\bf a factor of $\sim 10-50$ in the central occupation and $\sim 10-70\%$ in
the satellite occupation fraction}) is introduced in the reconstruction of
quasar host halo mass distributions from the observed two-point-correlation
function, if the HOD modeling does not account for the quenching effect in the
central occupation function. While there is strong suppression of the
occupation fraction of central quasars, the satellite occupation still follows
a power-law like behavior. Our results show that the global satellite fraction
of quasars increases monotonically from high to low redshifts, with $20-40 \%$
of the quasars being satellite at intermediate redshifts, consistent with
previous clustering based estimates. In addition, our study reveals that while
the occupation function of quasars depends on redshift, luminosity, and
feedback modes, there is hardly any evolution in the supermassive black hole
(SMBH; mass-selected sample) occupation. The SMBH HOD over the entire parameter
space is well-modeled by a power-law and a step function similar to what has
been found for galaxies and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei.

Result: 电子质量比为$1.0081 \pm 0.0046$，EDE能量分数上限为0.016；不同模型在$n_s-r$平面上表现出不同的后验分布。

Conclusion: 变电子质量模型适合Starobinsky暴胀，而EDE模型更倾向于标准超对称混合暴胀。

Abstract: Primarily motivated by the Hubble tension, we analyze the varying electron
mass model and axionlike early dark energy model (EDE) using baryon acoustic
oscillation data from DESI DR2 data and including the recent results from ACT
DR6. Our analysis indicates that $m_{e} / m_{e0} = 1.0081 \pm 0.0046 $ and the
energy fraction of EDE is constrained as $f_\mathrm{EDE} < 0.016$. Since those
cosmological models fit with different spectral index $n_s$, we show the
posterior of those models on the ($n_s-r$) plane and point out that, for
example, Starobinsky inflation works for varying electron mass model while the
standard supersymmetric hybrid inflation is preferred in the EDE model.

Abstract: We present a measurement of the non-Gaussian four-point correlation function
(4PCF) from the DESI DR1 Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample. For the
gravitationally induced parity-even 4PCF, we detect a signal with a
significance of 14.7$\sigma$ using our fiducial setup. We assess the robustness
of this detection through a series of validation tests, including auto- and
cross-correlation analyses, sky partitioning across multiple patch
combinations, and variations in radial scale cuts. Due to the low completeness
of the sample, we find that differences in fiber assignment implementation
schemes can significantly impact estimation of the covariance and introduce
biases in the data vector. After correcting for these effects, all tests yield
consistent results. This is one of the first measurements of the connected 4PCF
on the DESI LRG sample: the good agreement between the simulation and the data
implies that the amplitude of the density fluctuation inferred from the
connected 4PCF is consistent with the Planck $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The
methodology and diagnostic framework established in this work provide a
foundation for interpreting parity-odd 4PCF.

Conclusion: LIM技术能够有效揭示不同信号的结构特征，未来SKA-Mid的观测将进一步推动这一领域的研究。

Abstract: Line intensity mapping (LIM) is an emerging technique for probing the large
scale structure (LSS) in the post-reionisation era. This captures the
integrated flux of a particular spectral line emission from multiple sources
within a patch of the sky without resolving them. Mapping different galaxy line
emissions, such as the HI $21$-cm and CO rotational lines via LIM, can reveal
complementary information about the bias with which the line emitters trace the
underlying matter distribution and how different astrophysical phenomena affect
the clustering pattern of these signals. The stage where the structures in the
cosmic web merge to form a single connected structure is known as the
percolation transition. Using mock HI $21$-cm and CO($1-0$) LIM signals in the
post-reionisation universe, we explore the connectivity of structures through
percolation analysis and compare it with that of the underlying galaxy
distribution. We probe the relative contributions of voids, filaments, and
sheets to the galaxy density and line intensity maps using a morphological
measure known as the local dimension. The CO($1-0$) map exhibits an increased
filamentary behaviour and larger contribution from sheets than the $21$-cm map.
We attempt to explain such an emission of the CO($1-0$) line from biased
environments. The upcoming SKA-Mid will produce tomographic intensity maps of
the $21$-cm signal at $z \lesssim 3$ in Band-1. CO maps can be produced at
these redshifts in phase 2 of SKA-Mid, where the frequency coverage is expected
to increase up to $\sim 50$ GHz. We present forecasts for the recovery of the
local dimensions of these intensity maps contaminated by instrumental noise,
considering SKA-Mid observations.

Abstract: Here we report the first measurement of the parity-violating (PV) 4-Point
Correlation Function (4PCF) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument's Year
1 Luminous Red Galaxy (DESI Y1 LRG) sample, motivated by the potential
detection of the PV 4PCF in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (SDSS BOSS) galaxies. In our auto-correlation ("auto")
analysis, we find a statistically significant excess of the PV signal compared
to mocks without any PV, at 4-10$\sigma$ depending on details of the analysis.
This could arise either from genuine PV or from an underestimation of the
variance in the mocks; it is unlikely to arise, at the signal level, from a
systematic. We then cross-correlate ("cross") the putative PV signal between
different, independent patches of sky, and there find no detection of parity
violation. The two measurements are in significant tension: while the cross has
somewhat larger error bars than the auto, this is not sufficient to explain the
discrepancy. We thus present the current work as an intriguing addition to the
PV work on BOSS and as motivation for exploring further the relationship
between the auto and cross PV 4PCF analyses.

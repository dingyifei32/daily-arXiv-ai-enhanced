In the present study, we investigate formation of the circumstellar matter (CSM) in double white-dwarf (WD) mergers. We further study the interaction between the CSM and the SN ejecta. We first model the orbital evolution and super-Eddington mass transfer/ejection in the double WD systems. We then conduct hydrodynamical and light-curve (LC) simulations of the SN-CSM interaction, assuming a prompt SN Ia explosion in a context of the carbon-ignited violent merger (C-ignited VM). Our simulations show that at the moment of the merger, the binary system has the CSM distribution following $ρ_{\\mathrm{CSM}}\\simeq D(r/10^{14}\\ \\mathrm{cm})^{-3.5}\\ (D\\simeq 10^{-14}\\text{--}10^{-13}\\ \\rm g\\ cm^{-3})$. The simulated LCs reproduce the early flux excesses across optical to UV bands, as well as their color evolution, observed in the VM candidates, i.e., 03fg/02es-like SNe Ia. This supports that 03fg/02es-like objects originate from the VM explosions. We also discuss the case of the helium-ignited VM, which might be realized in some WD-WD mergers depending on the He content in the system. Focused here is the timing when the explosion is initiated, and we find that the explosion is initiated after the companion WD is, at least partially, tidally disrupted also in this case; we thus expect the formation of the CSM through the mass transfer phase also for the helium-ignited VM scenario."}

Leveraging Jax and NumPyro for differentiable forward modeling and efficient Bayesian inference, FEADME enables large-sample, reproducible analyses of disk-dominated emission-line profiles. We apply the framework to 237 double-peaked emitters (DPEs) from the literature and to five tidal disruption events (TDEs) with disk-like H$α$ emission, fitting three physically motivated model families per spectrum and selecting the preferred model using approximate leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation. We find that AGN exhibit a broad, continuous distribution of disk geometries and kinematics, with significant diversity in disk parameters. Most TDE disk parameter distributions are statistically indistinguishable from those of the AGN, with the sole robust difference being that TDE disks are significantly more circular, consistent with rapid debris circularization in tidal disruption events. The majority of both AGN and TDEs favor models that include both a disk and an additional broad-line component, suggesting that disk emission commonly coexists with more isotropic or wind-driven gas. These results indicate that once a line-emitting disk forms, its spectroscopic appearance is governed by similar physical processes in both persistent AGN and transient TDE accretion flows, and they demonstrate the utility of FEADME for population-level studies of disk structure in galactic nuclei."}

These observations have led to a rethinking of these models, and numerous astrophysical and cosmological solutions have been proposed, including cosmic strings, topological defects that may be remnants of a specific phase transition in the very early moments of the Universe. In this paper, we integrate cosmic strings, a source of nonlinear and non-Gaussian perturbations, into the semi analytical code Zeus21, allowing us to efficiently predict the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF). We conduct a precise study of parameter degeneracies between star-formation astrophysics and cosmic-string phenomenology. Our results suggest that cosmic strings can boost the early-galaxy abundance enough to explain the measured UVLFs from the James Webb and Hubble Space Telescopes from redshift z = 4 to z = 17 without modifying the star-formation physics. In addition, we set a new upper bound on the string tension of $Gμ\\lessapprox 10^{-8}$ ($95\\%$ credibility), improving upon previous limits from the cosmic microwave background. Although with current data there is some level of model and prior dependence to this limit, it suggests that UVLFs are a promising avenue for future observational constraints on cosmic-string physics."}

Cross-power spectra between multiple lines offer a robust alternative, mitigating noise bias and systematics. However, inferring the auto spectrum from cross-correlations relies on two key assumptions: that all tracers are linearly biased with respect to the matter density field, and that they are strongly mutually correlated. In this work, we introduce a new diagnostic statistic, \\(\\mathcal{Q}\\), which serves as a data-driven null test of these assumptions. Constructed from combinations of cross-spectra between four distinct spectral lines, \\(\\mathcal{Q}\\) identifies regimes where cross-spectrum-based auto-spectrum reconstruction is unbiased. We validate its behavior using both analytic toy models and simulations of LIM observables, including star formation lines ([CII], [NII], [CI],[OIII]) and the 21-cm signal. We explore a range of redshifts and instrumental configurations, incorporating noise from representative surveys. Our results demonstrate that the criterion \\( \\mathcal{Q} \\approx 1 \\) reliably selects the modes where cross-spectrum estimators are valid, while significant deviations are an indicator that the key assumptions have been violated.

Magnetars highly magnetized neutron stars and a leading progenitor candidate for FRBs also produce similar but much fainter millisecond radio pulses, suggesting a possible connection between the two phenomena. The irregularity of the time series of repeating FRBs and magnetar pulses may provide insight into the underlying progenitor activity. In this study, we analyze time-series data from three repeating FRB sources (four datasets) and the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 to investigate potential patterns in burst arrival times, energy fluctuations, and peak-frequency shifts. We quantify the degree of randomness (Pincus Index; PI) and chaos (Largest Lyapunov Exponent; LLE) for these three parameters. We find that waiting times across all repeating FRBs exhibit high PI (high randomness) and low LLE (low chaos), consistent with the behavior of magnetar radio pulses. This similarity suggests that both may share a common triggering mechanism. In contrast, the energy fluctuations of both repeating FRBs and magnetar pulses occupy the same region in PI-LLE phase space but display much larger scatter than the other two domains. We discuss the possibility that beaming effects or strong variability in radio-emission efficiency may explain their distinct behavior in the energy domain."}

When such a potential is present, a 3-form field may exhibit either quintessence-like or phantom-like behaviour. In this paper, we consider a 3-form model with a Gaussian potential, which features stable, ghost-free phantom-like behaviour within its convergence region and leads to an LSBR late-time attractor. We constrain this model observationally by performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis employing a comprehensive cosmological dataset, including Planck PR4 cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae data, low-$z$ Cepheid calibrators, and DES Y1 large-scale structure observations. We demonstrate that the 3-form model successfully increases the predicted Hubble parameter of CMB and BAO data from $67.89\\pm0.36{\\rm km/s/Mpc}$ of $Λ$CDM model to $68.29^{+0.56}_{-0.61}{\\rm km/s/Mpc}$ without fine-tuning of the model parameters, thus reducing the tension with the late-time observation. Furthermore, we verify the sub-dominance of the 3-form field perturbation via both analytical and numerical analyses.

A jet with an inhomogeneous Lorentz factor distribution develops internal shocks both below and above the photosphere, relaxing toward homologous expansion. Below the photosphere, neutrons, whose mean free paths are much longer than those of charged particles, play an essential role in the dissipation process. Using neutron-inclusive shell simulations with initial conditions based on the collapsar scenario, we link the statistical inhomogeneity of the jet at the breakout of the progenitor to the dissipation that occurs inside and outside the photosphere, and calculate the GeV-TeV neutrino counterpart originated from inelastic neutron-proton interactions consistently with the prompt gamma-ray emission. We find that the peak energy of the GeV-TeV neutrinos is in 10-30 GeV irrespective to the baryon loading factor of the jet, with the high-energy tail extending into the TeV range as the amplitude of the time variability becomes stronger. When gamma-ray emission is efficient as in typical GRBs (i.e., the gamma-ray radiation efficiency with respect to the total jet power is approximately 100%, the radiative efficiency of GeV-TeV neutrinos remains 0.1-10%. By contrast, when the gamma-ray radiation efficiency is relatively low (< 10%) for jets where a large fraction of the energy is dissipated below the photosphere, the neutrino efficiency can increase up to 20%. This suggests that GRBs with relatively low gamma-ray luminosities, as well as X-ray-rich transients, can be promising targets for ongoing and future GeV-TeV neutrino transient searches."}

While the nominal HLTDS will use only the Roman prism, in this work we consider the utility of the Roman grism observations from overlap with the High-Latitude Wide-Area Survey for SNIa cosmology. We determine a galaxy grism redshift recovery rate by simulating dispersed grism images and measuring redshifts with the Grizli software, obtaining an $H$-band 50% redshift recovery at magnitude 20.61 and 90% recovery at magnitude 19.27.

We apply these redshift efficiencies to SNIa catalog level simulations and predict that $\\sim$6800 SNe will have a SN or host spectroscopic redshift. Second, we evaluate the size of potential systematics related to modeling the grism redshift efficiency by considering the impact of additional dependencies on stellar mass and host galaxy color.

We fit five XMM-Newton spectra of Fairall 9 using the hybrid reXcor model taking into account both hot and warm corona. The soft excess is explained by a combination of a physically motivated warm corona and the disc reflection. Then, we perform a wavelet coherence analysis of the light curves between 0.3 - 1 and 1 - 4 keV bands. The spectral fits are consistent with a rapidly spinning black hole ($a = 0.99$), a warm corona with optical depth $\\sim$10 - 30, and a hot lamp-post corona located at either 5 or $20~r_{\\rm g}$. This configuration supports a coexisting hot and warm corona scenario, allowing the disc to extend almost to the event horizon.

The network is trained on ($25 h^{-1}$Mpc)$^3$ volumes of galaxy catalogs from L-Galaxies and can successfully extrapolate its predictions to other semi-analytic models (GAEA, SC-SAM, and Shark) and, more remarkably, to hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, and SWIFT-EAGLE). Our results show that the network is robust to variations in astrophysical and subgrid physics, cosmological and astrophysical parameters, and the different halo-profile treatments used across simulations.

The core of our method introduces a two-step reweighting scheme: first, gravitational wave parameter estimation is performed under a uniform sky prior; the resulting posterior is then used to reweight galaxy positions within the Euclid catalog, constructing an astrophysically informed positional prior. Comparing this Euclid-informed prior against a uniform prior within our framework reveals distinct behaviors. While the posterior estimates of the intrinsic waveform parameters show little sensitivity to the prior change, the Bayes factor for lensing identification exhibits significant prior dependence. Crucially, for truly lensed event pairs, the Bayes factor systematically increases, whereas for unlensed pairs it decreases. This dual effect is vital for robust discrimination. Our analysis demonstrates that this multi-messenger approach significantly improves the confidence of lensing searches. For lensed pairs, the method boosts the Bayes factor by an average factor of $\\sim 10$, while effectively suppressing false positives for unlensed coincidences. This underscores the critical importance of prior specification and showcases the substantial gains achievable by synergizing gravitational-wave data with electromagnetic survey information."}

Inflationary models make predictions for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and the spectral index $n_s$ of initial density fluctuations. In light of relevant data releases this year, we present constraints on these two parameters using the latest cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation data (BAO) available. Using data from Planck, the South Pole Telescope, Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and BICEP/Keck experiments, we derive $n_s=0.9682\\,\\pm\\,0.0032$ and a 95% upper limit of $r<0.034$. This upper limit on $r$ is consistent with the official BICEP/Keck result given the numerical precision of the analyses and our choice to impose the self-consistency relation for single field slow-roll inflation on the tensor power spectrum; the $r$ constraint is not impacted by the additional CMB data. While adding DESI BAO data to the CMB data has a negligible impact on $r$, the $n_s$ constraint shifts upward to $0.9728\\,\\pm\\,0.0029$, which favours monomial inflaton potentials with $N_\\star\\sim 50$ over Starobinsky $R^2$ or Higgs inflation with $N_\\star = 51$ and $N_\\star = 55$, respectively.

In this paper, we present an analysis of the $\\approx$300-day TESS observation of a blazar 3C 371 using power spectrum density, structure-function, and weighted wavelet Z-transform approaches. To reduce the effect of gaps and noise, Continuous auto-regressive moving averages, Bartlett periodogram, and wavelet decomposition methods are used. We have also used recurrence analysis to account for the nonlinearity present in the data and to quantify variability or periodicity as the recurrent state. Considering the entirety of the TESS observations, we derive the variability timescale to be around 4.5 days. Sector-wise analysis found variability timescales in the range of 3.0--7.0 days, values that are found to be consistent using different methods. When analyzing multiple sectors together, significant variability, which could be quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), of duration 3--6 days in individual segments, is detected. These may be attributed to the kink instabilities developed in the jet or the existence of mini-jets inside a jet undergoing precession. We find that these methods, when applied appropriately, can be used to study the variability in TESS data. The noise present in these TESS observations can be minimized using Bartlett's periodogram and wavelet decomposition to recover the real stochastic variability."}

We apply the technique to Euclid, Rubin and SKA public specifications in the range 0.2 < z < 1.8 and show that one can then obtain model-independent constraints of the expansion E(z i ) and the growth factor G(z i ). We also show the change in gain in precision at each z- shell when going from pessimistic cut at linear scales to more optimistic non-linear settings, or the difference between using each survey alone or a combination of all of them, or the impact from fixing or adding more degrees of freedom in the non-linear modeling. We found that, in the most agnostic case, one can still reach high precision on E(z i ) in the order of the percent level when combining the three surveys at once while the growth factor G(z i ) has for the same settings one order of magnitude weaker constraints. We also found for both factors, an improvement that can reach one order of magnitude in precision when passing from linear to non-linear scales.

However, the Bayes factor, a key metric for model comparison, remains inconclusive on which model is preferred. This paper applies the BF method, that integrates both Bayesian and frequentist approaches to DESI data to address the limitations of purely frequentist or Bayesian methods. It consists in considering the Bayes factor as a random variable and calculates its distribution, that results from values computed in a frequentist approach after perturbing the data following the model considered. We apply this hybrid method to DESI data, comparing the CPL and w models under various prior conditions, including weak and strong priors, and theory-informed priors. We find that, when the traditional bayes factor is considered, that weak priors favor the w model over CPL, while strong priors favor CPL. Additionally, theory-informed priors further enhance the preference for the w model. While when we apply the BF method, the preference for CPL over w is seen in all cases albeit with similar but reduced impact on the p-value from the different prior considerations. We also tried to generalize further, by perturbing as well the covariance matrix following the model considered, and found that, in general, the current data in that case is not stringent enough to disentangle between the two models. Our results demonstrate that varying the Bayes factor as a random variable, providing that the covariance matrix is kept as model independent, provides a robust model comparison, reducing the impact of prior dependence as well as offering quantitative assessment of the preferences of the competing models.(abridged)"}

If the propeller stage duration allows neutron stars to begin accreting matter from the interstellar medium and if the efficiency of accretion is high, then the number of accreting isolated neutron stars in eROSITA data can reach ~a few thousand.

The joint detection of multiple cosmic messengers can also elevate the significance of the observation when some or all of the constituent messengers are sub-threshold, not significant enough to declare their detection individually. Leveraging data from the LIGO, Virgo, and IceCube observatories, we conducted an archival investigation of sub-threshold multimessenger events.

Their detection will probe the structure of galactic nuclei and enable tests of general relativity. As these events will be observed over thousands of orbital cycles, they will be extremely sensitive to both the underlying spacetime and astrophysical environment, demanding exquisite theoretical models on both fronts to avoid biased or even erroneous results. In particular, many (E/)IMRIs are expected to occur within accretion discs around supermassive black holes, and the nonlinearities present when modeling these systems require numerical simulations. In preparation for future modeling of LISA sources, we have conducted a comparison between eight different hydrodynamical codes and applied them to the problem of a q = 10^{-4} mass ratio binary interacting with an accretion disc. Thicker discs appear more lenient, and all codes at sufficiently high resolutions are in good agreement with each other and analytical predictions. For thinner discs, beyond the reach of analytical models, we find substantial disagreement between 2D and 3D simulations and between different codes, including both the magnitude and sign of the torque.

Analyzing the full field of view spectrum in the $1.7-12.0$ keV band, we find evidence for two-temperature cluster gas. The hotter ($kT = 5.53 \\pm 0.13$ keV) gas has a velocity dispersion of $261 \\pm 13$ km s$^{-1}$ and a bulk velocity of $120 \\pm 20$ km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the central galaxy. The cooler gas ($kT = 2.0^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ keV) has an even broader velocity dispersion of $440 \\pm 130$ km s$^{-1}$, with a systematic uncertainty of $120$ km s$^{-1}$. The relative line-of-sight velocity between the hotter and cooler gas can be as high as $450 \\pm 140$ km s$^{-1}$. We interpret the high velocity dispersions as a combination of turbulence and bulk motion due to the cocoon shock. The upper limit on the non-thermal pressure fraction for the hotter gas is $7.7 \\pm 0.7\\%$. We associate the cooler gas with the central region ($<35$ kpc) and the hotter phase with the gas surrounding it ($35-100$ kpc). The total energy due to the kinetic motion is $5.1 \\times 10^{60}$ erg, consistent with the energy associated with the central radio source. The kinetic energy injection rate is $6.9 \\times 10^{44}-7.4 \\times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ under varying assumptions of injection timescales. The range of injection power is higher than the cooling luminosity, and thus the heating and cooling rates in Cygnus A are unbalanced."}

Such spikes are unique targets, which provide a possibility to discover the basic thermal s-wave annihilating WIMP with any mass up to the theoretical unitarity limit ~ 100 TeV. All relevant SMBHs were checked, and only MW* and M31* were identified as worthwhile objects. Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) sensitivity to heavy WIMPs in M31* was estimated. It was obtained that CTA will be able to probe a major part of TeV-scale WIMP parameter space in case of optimistic spike density configuration in M31*. In certain scenarios, M31* may yield even stronger constraints than MW*. Relevant systematic uncertainties were explored."}

Abstract: For many analyses in cosmology it is necessary to reconstruct the likely
distribution of unobserved fields, such as dark matter or baryons, from
observed luminous tracers. The dominant approach in cosmology has been to use
the so-called halo model, which assumes radially symmetric profiles centered
around luminous tracers such as galaxies. More recently, field-level machine
learning methods have been proposed that can learn to estimate the unobserved
field after being trained on simulations. However, it is unclear whether
machine learning methods indeed significantly improve over linear methods or
the halo model. In this paper we make a systematic comparison of different
approaches to reconstruct dark matter and baryons from galaxy data using the
CAMELS simulations. We find the best results using a combined GNN-CNN approach.
We also provide a general analysis and visualization of the relationship of
matter, baryons, halos and galaxies in these simulations to interpret our
results.

### [2] [Sample Variance Denoising in Cylindrical 21-cm Power Spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12545)
*Daniela Breitman,Andrei Mesinger,Steven G. Murray,Anshuman Acharya*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于扩散模型的去噪方法（21cmPSDenoiser），用于减少21厘米信号模拟中的样本方差，显著提升参数推断的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前21厘米信号模拟的有限体积导致样本方差问题，影响观测数据的解释。

Method: 使用基于分数的扩散模型，对单个21厘米二维功率谱进行去噪，预测总体均值。

Result: 去噪方法将样本方差减少了一个数量级，优于现有技术，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: 21cmPSDenoiser在参数推断中表现优异，提供无偏且更窄的后验分布。

Abstract: State-of-the-art simulations of reionisation-era 21-cm signal have limited
volumes, generally orders of magnitude smaller than observations. Consequently,
the Fourier modes in common between simulation and observation have limited
overlap, especially in cylindrical (2D) k-space that is natural for 21-cm
interferometry. This makes sample variance (i.e. the deviation of the simulated
sample from the population mean due to finite box size) a potential issue when
interpreting upcoming 21-cm observations. We introduce \texttt{21cmPSDenoiser},
a score-based diffusion model that can be applied to a single, forward-modelled
realisation of the 21-cm 2D power spectrum (PS), predicting the corresponding
\textit{population mean} on-the-fly during Bayesian inference. Individual
samples of 2D Fourier amplitudes of wave modes relevant to current 21-cm
observations can deviate from the mean by over 50\% for 300 cMpc simulations,
even when only considering stochasticity due to sampling of Gaussian initial
conditions. \texttt{21cmPSDenoiser} reduces this deviation by an order of
magnitude, outperforming current state-of-the-art sample variance mitigation
techniques like Fixing \& Pairing by a factor of few at almost no additional
computational cost ($\sim6$s per PS). Unlike emulators, the denoiser is not
tied to a particular model or simulator since its input is a (model-agnostic)
realisation of the 2D 21-cm PS. Indeed, we confirm that it generalises to PS
produced with a different 21-cm simulator than those on which it was trained.
To quantify the improvement in parameter recovery, we simulate a 21-cm PS
detection by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Arrays (HERA) and run different
inference pipelines corresponding to commonly-used approximations. We find that
using \texttt{21cmPSDenoiser} in the inference pipeline outperforms other
approaches, yielding an unbiased posterior that is 50\% narrower.

### [3] [Breaking the Mass-sheet Degeneracy in Time-delay Cosmology with Lensed and Unlensed Type Ia Supernovae](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12754)
*Xiaolei Li,Kai Liao,Xuheng Ding*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种创新框架，通过结合引力透镜和非透镜Ia型超新星观测，解决了时间延迟宇宙学中的质量片退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决质量片退化（MSD）问题，提高强引力透镜系统对宇宙学参数的测量精度。

Method: 开发了一种贝叶斯框架，结合透镜放大测量和宇宙距离比，利用高斯过程重建距离-红移和星等-红移关系。

Result: 框架有效解决了MSD，结果与模拟数据中的基准MSD参数高度一致。

Conclusion: 该方法显著改善了强透镜系统的时间延迟距离测量，提升了宇宙学参数的推断精度。

Abstract: This study introduces an innovative framework aimed at overcoming the ongoing
issue of mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD) in time-delay cosmography by incorporating
observations of both gravitationally lensed and unlensed Type Ia supernovae
(SNe Ia). By simultaneously using lensing magnification measurements
$\mu^{\rm{obs}}$ and cosmic distance ratios ($D_s/D_{ds}$), we develop a
Bayesian framework capable of breaking the MSD. Specifically, we reconstruct
the distance-redshift and magnitude-redshift relations from unlensed Type Ia
supernovae using Gaussian process to avoid dependence on specific cosmological
models. Our framework shows substantial efficacy in resolving the MSD by
imposing constraints on the MSD parameter $\lambda$. Furthermore, we extend
this framework to analyze multiple gravitational lensing systems. The results
show strong agreement with the fiducial MSD parameters used in the data
simulation, confirming our method's effectiveness in mitigating the MSD.
Ultimately, this technique enables the derivation of corrected time-delay
distance measurements under the MSD, improving the precision of cosmological
parameters inferred from strong lensing systems.

Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations are expected to serve as a powerful and
independent probe of the expansion history of the universe. By providing direct
and calibration-free measurements of luminosity distances through waveform
analysis, GWs provide a fundamentally different and potentially more robust
approach to measuring cosmic-scale distances compared to traditional
electromagnetic observations, which is known as the standard siren method. In
this review, we present an overview of recent developments in GW standard siren
cosmology, the latest observational results, and prospects for constraining
cosmological parameters using future GW detections. We first introduce standard
sirens based on how redshift information is obtained and outline the Bayesian
framework used in cosmological parameter estimation. We then review the
measurements on the Hubble constant from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network and
present the potential role of future standard siren observations in
cosmological parameter estimations. A central focus of this review is the
unique ability of GW observations to break cosmological parameter degeneracies
inherent in the EM observations. Since the cosmological parameter degeneracy
directions of GW and EM observations are quite different (roughly orthogonal in
some cases), their combination can significantly improve constraints on
cosmological parameters. This complementarity is expected to become one of the
most critical advantages for GW standard siren cosmology. Looking forward, we
highlight the importance of combining GW standard sirens with other emerging
late-universe cosmological probes such as fast radio bursts, 21 cm intensity
mapping, and strong gravitational lensing to forge a precise cosmological probe
for exploring the late universe. Finally, we introduce the challenges and the
role of machine learning in future standard siren analysis.

### [5] [Analytic Gravitational Wave Spectrum in Next-to-Minimal Bouncing Cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12968)
*Changhong Li*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种非最小反弹宇宙模型（NMBC），通过增加一个早期收缩相，在引力波背景谱中引入断幂律特征，提高了可探测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反弹宇宙学提供了一种无奇点的膨胀替代方案，但最小实现仅预测简单的幂律引力波背景谱，观测窗口狭窄。

Method: 使用基于不等式代数的矩阵表示方法，推导了NMBC引力波背景谱的闭式表达式。

Result: 所有满足当前ΔNeff界限的NMBC模型均自动避免了跨普朗克问题，并可能在天文和实验室搜索中被探测到。

Conclusion: NMBC是一个自洽且自包含的框架，能够生成可探测的引力波背景，同时展示了矩阵表示方法在多相宇宙学中的广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Bouncing cosmology offers a singularity-free alternative to inflation, but
its minimal realization-comprising only four cosmic phases-predicts a simple
power-law stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) with a narrow
observational window. We introduce the next-to-minimal bouncing cosmology
(NMBC), which adds an extra early contraction phase that imprints a broken
power-law feature in the SGWB spectrum, enhancing detectability. Using our
matrix-representation method grounded in an inequality algebra, we derive a
closed-form expression for the NMBC SGWB spectrum. From this analytical result,
we show that all NMBC models satisfying the current \(\Delta N_{\rm eff}\)
bound \(\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2(f)<1.7\times10^{-6}\) automatically avoid the
trans-Planckian problem, \(\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4}<0.79\,m_{\rm pl}\). These
findings establish the NMBC as a self-consistent, self-contained framework
capable of generating a potentially detectable SGWB in both astrophysical and
laboratory searches, and demonstrate the broad utility of our
matrix-representation method for future SGWB analyses in multi-phase
cosmologies.

TL;DR: 研究了温度增强散射对宇宙一级相变参数的影响，发现其能显著增强相变并产生可探测的引力波信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 温度增强散射可能对宇宙相变的热有效势产生重要影响，进而影响相变参数和引力波背景。

Method: 采用半解析计算方法，分析温度依赖修正对相变参数的影响，并预测引力波谱。

Result: 温度增强散射能显著增强相变强度，产生的引力波信号可能被未来探测器探测到。

Conclusion: 温度依赖的微观物理过程对早期宇宙的宇宙学特征具有重要影响。

Abstract: Scatterings whose cross sections increase as the cosmic temperature
decreases, known as temperature-enhanced scatterings, can have a significant
impact on the thermal effective potential of scalar fields responsible for
driving cosmological first-order phase transitions. In this work, we
systematically investigate how the inclusion of temperature-dependent
corrections to the effective potential affects key phase transition parameters,
including the nucleation temperature, latent heat release, and inverse duration
parameter. These modifications influence both the strength and duration of the
phase transition, which in turn determine the properties of the resulting
stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Employing semi-analytic
computational methods, we evaluate the GW spectra generated under these
conditions and compare our predictions with the projected sensitivities of
forthcoming detectors such as LISA, DECIGO, and BBO. Our analysis demonstrates
that temperature-enhanced scatterings can substantially strengthen the phase
transition and produce GW signals that lie within the reach of future
observational facilities. This study highlights the importance of
temperature-dependent microphysical processes in shaping early Universe
cosmological signatures.

*Pranjal R. S.,Shivam Pandey,Dhayaa Anbajagane,Elisabeth Krause,Klaus Dolag*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 论文评估了现有分析模型在描述宇宙物质和重子分布时的表现，发现其精度在亚百分比到几个百分比之间，但需进一步改进以可靠解释多波长数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stage-IV 巡天将提供前所未有的物质分布测量精度，需要高度准确的理论模型。天体物理过程（如星系形成和演化）的建模不确定性是主要挑战。

Method: 通过分析物质和重子场的3D自功率谱和交叉功率谱，测试现有模型的准确性，使用Magneticum流体动力学模拟作为基准。

Result: 所有模型在亚百分比到几个百分比的精度内能重现功率谱，但在恢复晕属性（如气体丰度和热力学剖面）方面表现不一。

Conclusion: 现有模型需进一步改进和测试，以可靠解释多波长数据集。

Abstract: Upcoming Stage-IV surveys will deliver measurements of distribution of matter
with unprecedented precision, demanding highly accurate theoretical models for
cosmological parameter inference. A major source of modeling uncertainty lies
in astrophysical processes associated with galaxy formation and evolution,
which remain poorly understood. Probes such as the thermal and kinematic
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects, X-rays, and dispersion measure from fast radio
bursts offer a promising avenue for mapping the distribution and thermal
properties of cosmic baryons. A unified analytical framework capable of jointly
modeling these observables is essential for fully harnessing the complementary
information while mitigating probe-specific systematics. In this work, we
present a detailed assessment of existing analytical models, which differ in
their assumptions and prescriptions for simultaneously describing the
distribution of matter and baryons in the universe. Using the Magneticum
hydrodynamical simulation, we test these models by jointly analyzing the 3D
auto- and cross-power spectra of the matter and baryonic fields that underpin
the above probes. We find that all models can reproduce the power spectra at
sub-percent to few-percent accuracy, depending on the tracer combination and
number of free parameters. Their ability to recover underlying halo properties,
such as the evolution of gas abundance and thermodynamic profiles with halo
mass, varies considerably. Our results suggest that these models require
further refinement and testing for reliable interpretation of multi-wavelength
datasets.

TL;DR: 3D模拟研究了半相对论无碰撞磁重联，发现高磁化时3D效应会降低磁能耗散和非热粒子加速效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究半相对论条件下磁重联的行为，特别是在高磁化时3D效应的影响，以理解黑洞和中子星等天体物理环境中的磁重联现象。

Method: 采用真实的质子-电子质量比，通过参数扫描模拟不同上游离子磁化条件下的3D磁重联。

Result: 随着系统从轻度相对论过渡到超相对论，3D效应（如漂移扭结和磁通绳扭结动力学）显著影响重联行为，高磁化时磁能耗散和非热粒子加速效率降低。

Conclusion: 研究结果对理解高磁化天体物理环境中的磁重联具有重要意义，挑战了传统对3D相对论重联的预期。

Abstract: We present 3D simulations of semirelativistic collisionless magnetic
reconnection, where upstream ions are subrelativistic while electrons are
ultrarelativistic. We employ the realistic proton-to-electron mass ratio and
explore a range of upstream ion magnetization spanning two orders of magnitude,
with our highest-magnetization run achieving unprecedentedly large domain
sizes. Through a parameter scan, we find that as the system transitions from
mildly to trans- and ultrarelativistic regimes the qualitative behavior of
reconnection becomes strongly influenced by 3D effects mediated by drift-kink
and flux-rope kink dynamics. As a result, magnetic-energy dissipation at high
magnetizations, and the subsequent nonthermal particle acceleration, can become
less efficient, contrary to general expectations for 3D relativistic
reconnection. Our results have important implications for understanding
reconnection in magnetized astrophysical scenarios, such as the surroundings of
black holes and neutron stars.

TL;DR: 分析了20个潮汐撕裂事件（TDE）宿主星系，发现延伸发射线区（EELRs）与星系合并有关，且低质量恒星主导TDE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究TDE宿主星系中EELRs的存在及其与星系合并的关系，以及恒星质量分布对TDE的影响。

Method: 使用MUSE积分场光谱仪观测20个TDE宿主星系，分析EELRs和恒星种群，结合Starlight和BPASS模型。

Result: 5/20宿主星系检测到EELRs，且均与合并星系相关；低质量恒星主导TDE，但观测与模型存在矛盾。

Conclusion: TDE与星系合并密切相关，低质量恒星在TDE中占主导，但观测与模型的不一致需进一步研究。

Abstract: We present an analysis of twenty tidal disruption event (TDE) host galaxies
observed with the MUSE integral-field spectrograph on ESO VLT. We investigate
the presence of extended emission line regions (EELRs) and study stellar
populations mostly at sub-kpc scale around the host nuclei. EELRs are detected
in 5/20 hosts, including two unreported systems. All EELRs are found at
z<0.045, suggesting a distance bias and faint EELRs may be missed at higher
redshift. EELRs only appear in post-merger systems and all such hosts at
z<0.045 show them. Thus, we conclude that TDEs and galaxy mergers have a strong
relation, and >45% of post-merger hosts in the sample exhibit EELRs.
Furthermore, we constrained the distributions of stellar masses near the
central black holes (BHs), using the spectral synthesis code Starlight and
BPASS stellar evolution models. The youngest nuclear populations have typical
ages of 1 Gyr and stellar masses below 2.5MSun. The populations that can
produce observable TDEs around non-rotating BHs are dominated by subsolar-mass
stars. 3/4 TDEs requiring larger stellar masses exhibit multi-peaked light
curves, possibly implying relation to repeated partial disruptions of high-mass
stars. The found distributions are in tension with the masses of the stars
derived using light curve models. Mass segregation of the disrupted stars can
enhance the rate of TDEs from supersolar-mass stars but our study implies that
low-mass TDEs should still be abundant and even dominate the distribution,
unless there is a mechanism that prohibits low-mass TDEs or their detection.

TL;DR: 论文通过贝叶斯推断框架结合多源数据（如NICER测量、引力波数据、射电脉冲星质量等）研究中子星状态方程（EOS）和质量分布，发现脉冲轮廓系统误差对EOS推断影响最大，而PSR J0614$-$3329对低密度EOS有轻微软化作用。

Motivation: 研究中子星状态方程（EOS）和质量分布，量化观测和建模选择对致密物质推断的影响。

Method: 采用统一的贝叶斯推断框架，结合NICER测量、引力波数据、射电脉冲星质量和核理论，比较四种推断情景。

Result: 脉冲轮廓系统误差主导EOS不确定性，PSR J0614$-$3329轻微软化低密度EOS，贝叶斯模型比较支持ST+PDT模型。

Conclusion: NICER系统误差在致密物质推断中起关键作用，联合分析有助于打破建模退化。

Abstract: We present new constraints on the neutron star equation of state (EOS) and
mass distribution using a unified Bayesian inference framework that
incorporates latest NICER measurements, including PSR J0614$-$3329, alongside
gravitational wave data, radio pulsar masses, and nuclear theory. By
systematically comparing four inference scenarios--varying in the inclusion of
PSR J0614$-$3329 and in the pulse profile model used for PSR J0030+0451--we
quantify the impact of observational and modeling choices on dense matter
inference. We find that pulse profile systematics dominate EOS uncertainties:
the choice of hot spot geometry for PSR J0030+0451 leads to significant shifts
in the inferred stiffness of the EOS and maximum neutron star mass. In
contrast, PSR J0614$-$3329 mildly softens the EOS at low densities, reducing
the radius at \(1.4\,M_\odot\) by \(\sim 100\)~m. A Bayesian model comparison
yields a Bayes factor of $\log_{10} \mathrm{BF} \approx 1.58$ in favor of the
ST+PDT model over PDT-U, providing strong evidence that multi-messenger EOS
inference can statistically discriminate between competing NICER pulse profile
models. These results highlight the critical role of NICER systematics in dense
matter inference and the power of joint analyses in breaking modeling
degeneracies.

TL;DR: GRB~230307A是2023年3月7日观测到的极高流量伽马射线暴，具有快速变化的峰值和长持续时间，伴随千新星发现，为研究长暴与致密天体合并提供了新视角。

Motivation: 研究GRB~230307A的高流量和独特时间-光谱特征，以探索长暴与致密天体合并的关联及其辐射机制。

Method: 采用高时间分辨率光谱分析，使用双平滑断裂幂律模型进行拟合，追踪参数演化。

Result: 发现参数演化符合快冷却同步辐射模型，晚期流量陡降可能与高纬度辐射相关，推断出极高的洛伦兹因子（Γ=1600）。

Conclusion: GRB~230307A不仅因其高流量引人注目，还为长暴与致密天体合并的新类别提供了独特的时间-光谱特征研究机会。

Abstract: On March 7th, 2023 the \textit{Fermi} Gamma-ray Burst Monitor observed the
second highest fluence gamma-ray burst (GRB) ever, GRB~230307A. With a duration
beyond 100~s, GRB~230307A contains a multitude of rapidly-varying peaks, and
was so bright it caused instrumental effects in the GBM detectors. The high
fluence of this burst, (6.02 $\pm$ 0.02)$\times$10$^{-3}$ erg cm$^{-2}$,
prompted rapid follow-up across the electro magnetic spectrum including the
discovery of an associated kilonova. GRB~230307A is one of a few long GRBs with
an associated compact merger origin. Three main temporal regions of interest
are identified for fine time-resolution spectral analysis: triggering pulse,
main emission, and late emission, and the parameter evolution is traced across
these regions. The high flux of the burst allowed for the statistical
preference of a more complex, physically-motivated model, the Double Smoothly
Broken Power Law, over typical spectral fitting functions for GRBs. From this
model the evolution of the parameters was found to be in accordance with those
expected for synchrotron radiation in the fast-cooling regime. Additionally, it
was found that the flux experiences a steep decline in late time intervals, a
feature which is often attributed to high-latitude emission, which follows the
dissipation episodes. Furthermore, GRB~230307A was found to have one of the
highest inferred bulk Lorentz factors of $\Gamma = 1600$. GRB~230307A is a
noteworthy burst in terms of flux alone, but additionally provides a unique
insight into the possible temporal and spectral characteristics of a new long
merger class of GRBs.

capabilities of MESA allow for more detailed simulations of quasi-star

Simulation Toolkit (MESA-QUEST), is available in a publicly accessible

Abstract: Sagittarius~A$^*$, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy,
exhibits flares across various wavelengths, yet their origins remain elusive.
We performed 3D two-temperature General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic
(GRMHD) simulations of magnetized accretion flows initialized from multi-loop
magnetic field configuration onto a rotating black hole and conducted General
Relativistic Radiative Transfer (GRRT) calculations considering contributions
from both thermal and non-thermal synchrotron emission processes. Our results
indicate that the polarity inversion events from the multi-loop magnetic field
configurations can generate $138\,\rm THz$ flares consistent with observations
with the help of non-thermal emission. By tracing the intensity evolution of
light rays in GRRT calculations, we identify the precise location of the
flaring region and confirm that it originates from a large-scale polarity
inversion event. We observe time delays between different frequencies, with
lower-frequency radio flares lagging behind higher frequencies due to plasma
self-absorption in the disk. The time delay between near-infrared and 43 GHz
flares can reach up to $\sim 50$ min, during which the flaring region gradually
shifts outward, becoming visible at lower frequencies. Our study confirms that
large-scale polarity inversion in a Standard And Normal Evolution (SANE)
accretion flow with a multi-loop initial magnetic configuration can be a
potential mechanism driving flares from Sgr~A$^*$.

Abstract: The hypothesis that supernova remnants are key sources of Galactic cosmic
rays gains support from evidence that HESS J1731-347 one of the few Galactic
objects capable of accelerating hadronic cosmic rays to TeV energies may harbor
an exotic strange quark star rather than a conventional neutron star. This
conclusion stems from its unusually low mass and compact radius, which
challenge standard neutron star models. If confirmed, such a quark star could
generate cosmic rays through the transition from the two-flavor
color-superconducting (2SC) phase to the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase,
potentially releasing strangelets, hypothetical strange quark matter particles.
Detecting these strangelets in cosmic rays would provide groundbreaking
evidence for quark matter. The future Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), with its
unmatched sensitivity and spectral resolution in the very-high-energy (VHE)
gamma-ray regime, is uniquely positioned to search for their annihilation or
decay signatures. We analyze theoretical predictions for these gamma-ray
signals and evaluate CTA's potential to detect or constrain them. Additionally,
we present an in-depth assessment of CTA observations of HESS J1731-347,
focusing on spectral features that could confirm strangelet production. A
positive detection would not only validate the existence of strange quark stars
but also establish a direct link between quark matter and cosmic-ray
acceleration, reshaping our understanding of compact objects and high-energy
astrophysics.

Abstract: Black hole X-ray binaries (candidates) currently identified in our galaxy are
mainly transient sources, with the majority discovered through the detection of
their X-ray outbursts. Among these, only four were found during faint outbursts
exhibiting peak X-ray luminosities $L_{\rm X}\lesssim10^{36}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$,
likely due to the previous lack of sensitive, wide-field monitoring instruments
in the X-ray band. In this Letter, we present the discovery of an intriguing
X-ray transient, EP J182730.0-095633, via the Einstein Probe (EP) and
subsequent multi-wavelength follow-up studies. This transient, located on the
Galactic plane, experienced a faint and brief X-ray outburst lasting about 20
days. Its X-ray spectrum is non-thermal and consistent with a power-law model
with a nearly constant photon index of $\Gamma \sim2$ throughout the outburst.
A long-lasting millihertz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) signal was detected
in its X-ray light curve, centered around a frequency of $\sim0.04$ Hz. A
transient near-infrared source was identified as its counterpart, although no
optical emission was detectable, likely due to significant extinction. A radio
counterpart was also observed, displaying an inverted radio spectrum with
$\alpha\sim0.45$. The X-ray spectral and temporal characteristics, along with
the multi-wavelength properties, indicate that the source is a faint low-mass
X-ray binary, with the compact object likely being a black hole. This work
demonstrates the potential of the EP in discovering new X-ray binaries by
capturing faint-level X-ray outbursts.

TL;DR: 论文研究了年轻大质量星团（如NGC 6611）作为宇宙射线源的贡献，通过分析Fermi-LAT数据，估算其加速效率为1%至4%。


<details>

Motivation: 量化年轻大质量星团对银河系宇宙射线的贡献，并估算其典型的加速效率。

Method: 分析Fermi-LAT数据，研究M16区域的GeV波段发射，并模拟恒星风终止激波的加速过程及粒子传播。

Result: 在NGC 6611附近的分子云中发现了显著的GeV发射，表明其加速效率约为1%至4%。

Conclusion: NGC 6611的加速效率较低，但仍对银河系宇宙射线有一定贡献。

Abstract: Context. Young Massive Star Clusters, long considered as potentially
important sources of galactic cosmic rays, have recently emerged as gamma-ray
emitters up to very high energies. Aims. In order to quantify the contribution
of this source class to the pool of Galactic CRs, we need to estimate the
typical acceleration efficiency of these systems. Methods. We search for
emission in the GeV band, as most of the energy is emitted in this band. We
perform an analysis of Fermi-LAT data collected towards the M16 region, a
star-forming region also known as the Eagle Nebula, which hosts the Young
Massive Star Cluster NGC 6611. We model the acceleration at the stellar wind
termination shock and the propagation through the wind-blown bubble to derive
the energetics of the process and interpret the GeV observations. Results. We
find significant GeV emission in correspondence of a molecular cloud associated
to the Young Massive Star Cluster NGC 6611. We interpret this as hadronic
emission associated to particle accelerated at the cluster wind termination
shock and propagated through the low-density wind-excavated bubble to the
cloud. Our modeling allows us to put firm constraints on the acceleration
efficiency in NGC 6611, assessing it between $\sim$ 1 % and $\sim$ 4 %.

Abstract: We report the discovery of a highly polarized millimeter (mm) continuum
source in the central region of NGC 4945, identified through ALMA Band 3
observations. This starburst Seyfert 2 galaxy contains numerous compact mm
sources, yet only one - located approximately 3.4" (~60 pc) from the galactic
center and unresolved with ~0.1" resolution - exhibits an unusually high
polarization degree of 50% $\pm$ 14%, likely originating from non-thermal
synchrotron radiation. The source is faint, yet clearly detected in two
separate epochs of observation taken 14 days apart, with flux of 0.104 $\pm$
0.018 and 0.125 $\pm$ 0.016 mJy, as well as in earlier ALMA observations,
showing no variability at any timescale. The spectral index remains stable
within large uncertainties, -1.8 $\pm$ 2.5 and -1.3 $\pm$ 2.5. The source,
which we further refer to as Punctum due to its compactness, revealed no clear
counterparts in existing X-ray or radio observations. Assuming association with
the central region of NGC 4945, we estimate upper limits for its luminosity of
~1 $\times$ 10$^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the 3-6 keV X-ray band (from archival
Chandra data) and ~5 $\times$ 10$^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at 23 GHz (from archival
ATCA data). A comparison of the radio, mm (including polarization), and X-ray
properties with known astrophysical sources emitting synchrotron radiation,
such as accreting neutron stars, supernova remnants, and non-thermal galactic
filaments, revealed no clear match in any of these scenarios. The exact nature
of this highly polarized source remains undetermined.

Abstract: Pressure isotropy, i.e., radial pressure equal to tangential pressure, is
often assumed when studying neutron stars. However, multiple physical
mechanisms, including pion/kaon condensation, magnetic fields, superfluidity,
dark matter clustering, and violations of general relativity, can lead to a
pressure anisotropy. This work presents a comprehensive measurement of pressure
anisotropy in neutron stars. Our analysis incorporates both an extensive set of
nuclear experimental constraints and multi-messenger astrophysical
observations, including gravitational wave detections and electromagnetic
observations. The Bayesian framework employed marginalizes over equation of
state uncertainties and allows the anisotropy to vary between individual
neutron stars. We find the Bayes factor for anisotropy against isotropy is
$e^{0.46}=10^{0.20}=1.58\gtrsim 3:2$. Additionally, the posterior indicates a
population-wide preference for negative pressure anisotropy, with GW170817
serving as the primary contributor. The individual variability suggests
density-scale-independent anisotropy, potentially attributable to magnetic
fields, dark matter clustering, or deviations from general relativity rather
than phase transitions. While the evidence for pressure anisotropy remains
inconclusive, these results demonstrate that pressure anisotropy can be
utilized as a valuable diagnostic tool for identifying missing physics in
neutron star modeling or revealing tension among observations in the era of
multi-messenger astronomy.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了活动星系核（AGN）中的准周期振荡（QPOs），特别是在RE~J1034+396中发现的QPO三重结构，为探索超大质量黑洞周围的吸积盘和冕区提供了新视角。

Result: 约束了黑洞质量为$1.7^{+0.9}_{-0.8} \times 10^{6} M_\odot$，并发现低自旋参数0.017。提出UFO模型解释了QPO的滞后反转和长期演化。

Conclusion: 该研究为AGN吸积盘内区提供了新见解，并推动了数值模拟和高精度时序观测的进一步研究。

Abstract: Quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide a
powerful tool for probing the structure of the innermost accretion flow and
corona around supermassive black holes. RE~J1034+396, the most prominent AGN
known to host an X-ray QPO, exhibits both short-term and long-term QPO
evolution, offering a unique opportunity to investigate accretion disk and
corona physics through its temporal behavior. We report a possible long-term
($\sim 92.2$ days) cyclic evolution of the QPO in RE~J1034+396, joining the
detected QPO ($\sim 3730$ s) and its short-term ($\sim 17$ ks) modulation to
form a possible QPO triplet, which is potentially the first such structure
identified in an AGN. By applying the relativistic precession model to the QPO
triplet, we constrain the black hole mass to $1.7^{+0.9}_{-0.8} \times 10^{6}\
M_\odot$, consistent with independent estimates, and find a low dimensionless
black hole spin of $0.017^{+0.028}_{-0.012}$. We propose an exploratory model
that involves a quasiperiodic ultra-fast outflow (UFO) within the framework of
the relativistic precession model, explaining the QPO lag reversal, the
modulation of hard-band QPO amplitude by soft-band flux, and the long-term
evolution of timing properties. Supporting evidence includes blueshifted
emission and absorption lines indicating a strong UFO at $\sim 0.3c$. This work
provides new insights into the inner regions of AGN accretion disks and
motivates further efforts in both numerical modeling and high-cadence timing
observations.

Abstract: Based on solutions of the cascade equations, the air-shower universality is a
framework that for all air showers with the same energy, zenith angle, depth of
shower maximum, and muon number predicts the same longitudinal, lateral, and
energy distributions of electromagnetic shower particles. We employ a
universality-based model of shower development that incorporates hadronic
particle components to reconstruct observables from extensive air showers
produced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The model can estimate key
parameters, such as the depth of the shower maximum and the number of muons at
the event level. We discuss the performance of the reconstruction algorithm
using both air-shower simulations, and preliminary results obtained from the
Phase-I data of the Pierre Auger Observatory.

Method: 利用XMM-Newton观测数据生成计数率图像、等效宽度和中值光子能量图，结合Fermi/LAT伽马射线数据重分析及Hα发射搜索。

Conclusion: G118.4+37.0是一个中等年龄的SNR，在稀薄介质中膨胀并可能与致密相碰撞，支持其与Calvera脉冲星的关联。

Abstract: The candidate supernova remnant (SNR) G118.4+37.0 (Calvera's SNR), discovered
as a faint radio ring at high Galactic latitude and coincident with extended
Fermi/LAT gamma-ray emission, is likely associated to the X-ray pulsar 1RXS
J141256.0+792204 (Calvera). Previous XMM-Newton data hinted at soft diffuse
X-ray emission inside the ring but lacked sufficient exposure for detailed
characterisation. We obtained new XMM-Newton observations, and produced
count-rate images, equivalent width and median photon energy maps to identify
optimal regions for spectral analysis. We complemented these observations with
a reanalysis of Fermi/LAT gamma-ray data and new Telescopio Nazionale Galileo
observations aimed to search for Halpha emission. The X-ray diffuse emission is
well described by a model of shock-heated plasma with temperature kT \sim 0.15
keV, mildly under-solar N and o abundances and densities ne=0.1-0.7 cm-3.
According to our estimates, Calvera's SNR is 10-20 kya old and lies at a
distance of 4-5 kpc. A distinti "Clump" region shows hared emission equally
well described by a thermal (kT\sim 1.7 keV) or a non thermal model (Gamma \sim
2.7). The brightest X-ray area is close to the gamma-ray peak and to an
isolated Alpha filament. G118.4+37.0 is a middle-aged remnant which expands in
a tenuous medium and encountered a denser phase, likely the relic of the wind
activity of the massive progenitor star. The estimated SNR distance is
consistent within the uncertainties with that estimated for Calvera, confirming
that this peculiar pulsar was born in the explosion of a massive star high
above the Galactic disk. Our measured ambient density, together with the patchy
morphology of the gamma-ray emission and the detection of Halpha filaments
indicates that a hadronic origin is compatible with the gamma-ray flux, though
a mixed leptonic-hadronic cannot be excluded

Conclusion: σ-cut势和暗物质显著影响中子星振荡模式，验证了准普适关系，为极端条件下的物质研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: We study the mesonic nonlinear (NL) interaction equation of state (EoS)
employing the relativistic mean-field model and investigate the effect of
$\sigma$-cut potential (NL-$\sigma$ cut) and dark matter (NL DM) on the
non-radial and radial oscillation modes of neutron stars. For NL-$\sigma$ cut,
we include the $\sigma$-cut potential $U_{cut} (\sigma)$ to study its effect.
For the dark matter, we use the neutron decay anomaly model. For each model, we
investigate two extreme EoSs, stiff and soft, that cover the entire allowed
parameter range from the given model, consistent with the current astrophysical
constraints. The EoS and the stellar properties, such as mass and radius, are
calculated, and the effect of $\sigma$-cut and DM is discussed. Both non-radial
and radial oscillation modes are computed in the general relativistic
framework. We study the non-radial $f$ and $p_1$ mode frequency, damping time,
and some qusi-universal relations connecting the frequencies of the $f$-mode to
the average density and compactness. The analysis showed that the $f$ and $p_1$
mode frequencies at both 1.4~$M_{\odot}$ and the maximum mass configuration are
higher in the NL DM model compared to the NL and NL-$\sigma$ models. The
consistent alignment between our prior parameterizations and current
calculations strongly supports the existence of quasi-universal relations that
hold true irrespective of the particular matter components involved. For the
radial oscillations, we compute 10 lowest-order modes ($f$, $p$), study the
radial perturbations as well as the large frequency separation with NL-$\sigma$
cut and NL DM EoS, showing that the microphysics involved in the NS EoS is
imprinted on the frequency separation between different nodes.

Abstract: After nearly a decade in quiescence, the accreting millisecond pulsar IGR
J17511$-$3057 displayed a new outburst on 2025 February 11, its third since
discovery, following previous activity in 2009 and 2015. We report on an
XMM-Newton Target of Opportunity observation performed on 2025 March 4, more
than twenty days after the outburst onset. From the X-ray spectrum - well
described by an absorbed Comptonization model - we estimated an unabsorbed
0.5$-$10 keV luminosity of $L_X \sim 7 \times 10^{33} \, \mathrm{erg \,
s^{-1}}$ (assuming a source distance equal to the upper limit of $6.9$ kpc). To
place this in context, we analyzed an archival Chandra observation performed in
2019, which yielded a quiescent luminosity of $L_\mathrm{X,q} \sim 2 \times
10^{32} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$ in the same energy band. Although this
comparison indicates that the source was still well above its quiescent level
during the XMM-Newton observation, the estimated low luminosity during the late
stage of the 2025 outburst would typically place the source in the propeller
regime. Nevertheless, we unexpectedly detected coherent X-ray pulsations with
an amplitude peaking at $\sim$42% in the 0.3$-$3 keV band. We also observed a
spectral softening compared to the early stages of the outburst. Finally, we
report a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 60 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ on the source flux
density at 5.5 GHz from ATCA observations acquired on 2025 April 12, following
a decline of the accretion activity, as indicated by our analysis of NICER data
from 2025 March 15, which revealed no significant X-ray pulsations at a
luminosity level of $L_X \sim 1 \times 10^{34} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$. We
discuss our findings in the context of other accreting millisecond pulsars and
draw comparisons with transitional systems in the sub-luminous disk state.

Conclusion: IR回波在TDE和QPE研究中具有独特价值，未来NEO Surveyor将提供更多数据支持。

Abstract: AT2019qiz is the first standard optical tidal disruption event (TDE) with
detection of X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), providing strong evidence
for TDE-QPE association. Moreover, it belongs to the rare subset of optical
TDEs with prominent infrared (IR) echoes revealed by the multi-epoch photometry
from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The IR light curve shows
an early bump, followed by a steady rise until the second-to-last epoch, after
which it appears to enter a plateau phase. The dust temperature decreased until
the fourth epoch and remains approximately constant for the subsequent five
epochs. We have fitted the last five epochs using a convex dust ring model,
resulting in an inner radius $>1.2$ pc. Such a large radius greatly exceeds the
inner radius of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) torus for a $10^6\,M_{\odot}$
black hole and thus could be a torus remnant with the inner part having
vanished, further supporting the unified scenario of recently faded AGNs, TDEs,
and QPEs. Consequently, a connection between QPEs and IR-bright TDEs is
naturally expected. Moreover, the echo requires at least a peak bolometric
luminosity of $(6.6, 9.5, 1.0)\times 44 \,\text{erg}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ assuming
silicate, silicon carbide, and graphite dust grains, respectively, all of which
are significantly higher than the peak optical blackbody luminosity. It adds to
the accumulating evidence that the missing energy of TDEs may lie in the
unobservable extreme UV. This work highlights the unique value of IR echoes in
the study of TDEs and QPEs, and a promising prospect in the era of the
Near-Earth Object (NEO) Surveyor, the successor to WISE.

Abstract: We report on the results of a comprehensive analysis of X-ray observations
carried out with \textit{Chandra}, \textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{NuSTAR} of
the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) associated with PSR B1853+01, located inside the
W44 supernova remnant (SNR). Previous X-ray observations unveiled the presence
of a fast-moving pulsar, PSR B1853+01, located at the southern edge of the W44
thermal X-ray emission region, as well as an elongated tail structure trailing
the pulsar. Our analysis reveals, in addition, the presence of an ``outflow''
feature ahead of the pulsar extending for about 1 \arcmin ($\sim$ 1.0 pc at the
distance of 3.2 kpc). At larger scales, the entire PWN seems to be surrounded
by a faint, diffuse X-ray emission structure. The southern part of this
structure displays the same unusual morphology as the ``outflow'' feature ahead
of the pulsar, and extends along $\sim 6$ \arcmin ($\sim$ 5 pc) in the
direction of the pulsar proper motion. In this report, a spatially-resolved
spectral analysis for the different extended regions around PSR B1853+01 is
carried out. For an updated value of the column density of
$0.65_{+0.46}^{-0.42} \times 10^{22} ~\textrm{cm}^{-2}$, a power-law fit to the
``outflow'' region yields a spectral index $\Gamma \approx
1.24_{+0.23}^{-0.24}$, which is significantly harder than that of the pulsar
($\Gamma \approx 1.87_{+0.48}^{-0.43}$) and the pulsar tail ($\Gamma \approx
2.01_{+0.39}^{-0.38}$). We argue that both the ``outflow'' structure and the
surrounding halo-like X-ray emission might be produced by high-energy particles
escaping the PWN around PSR B1853+01, a scenario recently suggested also for
other Bow-shock PWNe with jet-like structures and/or TeV halos.

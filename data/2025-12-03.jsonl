Please see the short video in: https://youtu.be/IDqujoCPO-s", "summary": "Identifying the sources of high-energy (TeV-PeV) astrophysical neutrinos is crucial for studies in both astrophysics and particle physics. Despite extensive searches for more than a decade, which revealed several individual potential sources and only one potential source class, the origins of these neutrinos remain largely unresolved; thus, more source classes should be investigated. In this work, we conduct the first search for high-energy neutrino emission from a new source class, supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), which are also theoretically motivated. We perform an unbinned maximum-likelihood-ratio analysis on our constructed catalog of 693 SMBHB candidates and 10 years of IceCube public data. Our results show positive correlations, with higher significance in more physically motivated scenarios and the highest significance at 3.0$σ$. In addition, we also study potential connections between SMBHBs' high-energy neutrino and nano-Hz gravitational-wave emissions, the latter being the main target of pulsar timing arrays. Our results provide the first evidence of SMBHBs being high-energy neutrino emitters."}

Because the plasma in the jet-launching region is accelerated to relativistic velocities, and because the jet in M87 is nearly aligned with the line of sight (offset by ~17 degrees), a slow-light treatment is important for accurately modeling the observable structure. While fast-light images exhibit prominent helical or loop-shaped features in the jet - which we associate with narrow bundles of magnetic field lines - these features become stretched and smoothed-out in slow-light images. Our slow-light images instead exhibit a double-edged, cone-like morphology that is more consistent with observations of M87 than corresponding fast-light images. We find that the radius at which the plasma transitions from sub-relativistic to relativistic velocities is imprinted on slow-light images via a transition from loop-dominated at small distances from the black hole to edge-dominated at a larger distance, with the loop-edge transition occurring at larger distances for lower black hole spins. The jet image dynamics also vary with black hole spin, with low-spin models producing jets that exhibit substantial \"wobbling\", while high-spin models produce jets that are straighter and more stable in time. The spin-dependent jet morphology and variability are revealed by slow-light imaging because slow-light effects become more enhanced as the plasma velocity becomes more relativistic, and because the plasma acceleration is itself a strong function of the spin."}

Unlike standard SANE/MAD setups that impose a coherent large-scale poloidal loop, our \"sub-SANE\" initial conditions use multiple same-polarity small-scale magnetic loops. Rapid reconnection erases magnetic memory and enables large-scale dynamo to emerge early from MRI turbulence. We perform two such sub-SANE simulations at different BH spins ($a = 0.5, 0.9375$) and compare them with conventional SANE runs. The sub-SANE disks show regular large-scale dynamo cycles with periods of about ten orbits. Decomposition of the induction equation shows that the turbulent dynamo term is stronger in 3D compared to 2.5D and balances advection in the saturated state, confirming sustained large-scale field generation. These dynamo-generated fields are advected inward with minimal time lag, producing correlated peaks in both poloidal and toroidal field strengths from $r_{\\rm max}$ to the horizon. Early in the evolution, these peaks imprint directly onto the jet's electromagnetic energy flux, indicating that the jet mirrors the dynamo wave. Though jets form at early times, the sub-SANE runs eventually undergo jet shutdown. We show that this occurs when the magnetic field at the horizon loses coherence, as quantified by a decline in the signed-to-unsigned flux ratio $\\mathcal{C}_{\\rm BH}$ below $\\approx 0.6$. In contrast, the SANE reference case with similar accretion rate and horizon magnetic flux maintains high magnetic coherence because its initial large-scale field persists, allowing its jet to survive. Our results show that both dynamo-driven field evolution and horizon magnetic-field coherence critically regulate jet longevity, establishing a direct dynamo-jet connection in GRMHD disks."}

TDEs have also enabled the discovery of a few Massive Black Holes (MBHs) with inferred masses of $10^4$--$10^6\\,M_\\odot$, often associated with the nuclei of dwarf galaxies or ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs). Here we present AT2022zod, an extreme and short-lived optical flare in an elliptical galaxy at z=0.11, residing within 3kpc of the galaxy's centre. Its luminosity and ~30-day duration make it unlikely to have originated from the host galaxy's central supermassive black hole (SMBH), which estimate to have a mass around $10^8\\,M_\\odot$. Assuming that the emission mechanism is consistent with known observed TDEs, we find that such a rapidly evolving transient could either be produced by a MBH in the intermediate-mass range or, alternatively, result from the tidal disruption of a star on a non-parabolic orbit around the central SMBH. We suggest that the most plausible origin for AT2022zod is the tidal disruption of a star by a MBH embedded in a UCD. As the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time comes online, we propose that AT2022zod serves as an important event for refining search strategies and characterization techniques for intermediate-mass black holes."}

From the point of view of the FLRW observer, gathering data from sources at cosmological redshift $\\widehat{z}$, this functional generates a geometry--structure--growth contribution ${Ω_Λ(\\widehat{z})}$ to the FLRW cosmological constant ${\\widehatΩ_Λ}$. This redshift--dependent contribution erodes the interpretation of ${\\widehatΩ_Λ}$ as representing constant dark energy. In particular, ${Ω_Λ(\\widehat{z})}$ becomes significantly large at very low $\\widehat{z}$, where structures dominate the cosmological landscape. At the pivotal galaxy cluster scale, where cosmological expansion decouples from the local gravitation dynamics, we get ${Ω_Λ(\\widehat{z})/\\widehatΩ_Λ}\\,=\\,\\mathscr{O}(1)$, showing that late--epoch structures provide an effective field contribution to the FLRW cosmological constant that is of the same order of magnitude as its assumed value. We prove that ${Ω_Λ(\\widehat{z})}$ is generated by a scale-dependent effective field governed by structure formation and related to the comparison between the idealized FLRW past light cone and the actual physical past light cone. These results are naturally framed in the mainstream FLRW cosmology; they do not require exotic fields and provide a natural setting for analyzing the coincidence problem, leading to an interpretative shift in the current understanding of constant dark energy."}

However, its light curves deviate substantially from previous theoretical expectations. Motivated by these unique features, we have developed a novel model that successfully reproduces its peculiar evolution. Our model delineates five stages: (1) Initial Stage of inefficient circularization; (2) Slow-Rising Stage with a faint X-ray precursor disk fed by successive self-crossings; (3) Fast-Rising Stage, where delayed stream-disk interaction at momentum flux matching drives a sharp luminosity rise; (4) Plateau Stage with super-Eddington accretion, outflow, reprocessing, and a clear polar line-of-sight; and (5) Decline Stage of sub-Eddington accretion and ongoing reprocessing. Our fit indicates the disruption of a $M_* \\approx 0.4~M_\\odot$ main-sequence (MS) star with a penetration factor $β\\approx 1.0$. Our model, which incorporates key TDE processes, establishes EP240222a-like light curves as typical IMBH-TDE signatures.

However, it has been shown previously that the RSL approximation leads to photon non-conservation in some regimes. I show that these missing photons can be counted exactly for some numerical schemes. Adding them back into a simulation, however, is a much harder task. I show one example of such a scheme, which achieves sub-percent accuracy on simple tests. Unfortunately, the scheme performs much worse on semi-realistic simulations of cosmic reionization, leading to a faster overlap and significant errors in the point-to-point comparison of the RSL radiation field with the reference simulation that maintains the full speed of light for the radiative transfer."}

These multi-peak structures arise not only from coupled reactions but also, in some cases, from single reactions. Our study also confirmed previously identified key reactions and provides more robust lists. These reactions deserve priority consideration in future study."}

Understanding the physics of these processes remains a major challenge. Black holes have traditionally served as the central engines behind such phenomena, with well established energy extraction mechanisms including the Penrose process, the Blandford-Znajek process, and the Banados-Silk-West mechanism. However, studies in general relativity indicate that, under certain conditions, gravitational collapse may lead to the formation of naked singularities or other horizonless compact objects, which could in principle allow more efficient energy extraction than classical black holes. This brief review summarizes recent progress on energy extraction mechanisms in naked singularity spacetimes. We examine the roles of rotation, electromagnetic fields, and particle interactions in shaping extraction efficiency and dynamics. Particular attention is given to negative energy orbits and ergoregion physics, which enable Penrose type and magnetic Penrose mechanisms without an event horizon. We also discuss collisional Penrose processes and particle acceleration near the singularity, emphasizing their potential astrophysical implications. By comparing extraction efficiencies and physical conditions in black holes and naked singularities, we highlight how the absence of a horizon fundamentally alters the dynamics of energy release. These results suggest that naked singularities may serve as natural laboratories for strong field gravity and as alternative engines for high-energy astrophysical phenomena in the era of multi-messenger observations."}

We investigate whether next-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) can identify and characterise such subpopulations. Using the latest LVK constraints on the BNS merger rate, we generate mock ET catalogues containing a mixture of light and heavy subpopulations. The redshift distribution of each subpopulation is modeled as the convolution of the cosmic star formation rate with a time-delay distribution: heavy BNSs have fixed short delays, while light BNSs follow power-law delays with indices -0.5,-1,-1.5. Hierarchical Bayesian analyses are then performed on catalogues of 100-5,000 events. With hundreds of detections from ET, we will be able to establish that the total mass distribution is bimodal. A few thousand events are sufficient to disentangle the redshift distributions of the two subpopulations for moderate time-delay indices (-0.5 or -1). For steeper indices (-1.5), the differences are more subtle, requiring larger catalogues, beyond what we could explore given our computational resources. Next-generation detectors should enable the detection of multiple BNS subpopulations and their redshift evolution, providing valuable insight into their formation pathways."}

Our results reveal a clear, distance-decreasing dipole that remains coherent across shells, with subdominant higher-order multipoles, and the octupole fit capturing the main anisotropic features except in sparsely sampled or SDSS-dominated shells. The direction and amplitude of the dipole depend on whether the observed radial recessional velocities are corrected for peculiar velocities or not. If the correction is not applied, the dipole aligns with the major gravitational structures in the local universe. If it is applied, a global dipole still seems to be present, but the signal is much weaker and with much lower statistical significance. This decrease in the amplitude of the dipole supports the idea of a differential expansion rate in our universe, but does not clarify whether the origin is astrophysical or cosmological. Finally, we verify that, while this anisotropy could influence local measurements of the Hubble constant, its effect on the large-scale Hubble tension appears to be limited, as the distribution of galaxies hosting SNeIa, both used as calibrators to constrain $H_0$ and in the Hubble-flow, does not show a strong correlation with the dipole signal."}

However, despite the effort of intensive radio search for decades, none of these binaries has been found to date. These binaries are regarded as a holy grail of astronomy because they can greatly improve our understanding about relativistic systems of compact objects and fundamental physics. In this article, we propose the existence of exotic BH-NS binaries which can open a new way in searching the missing BH-NS binaries in our Galaxy. By considering the possible dark matter density spikes formed around the primordial black holes in the BH-NS binaries, we show that extremely high temperature ($\\sim 10^6$ K) could be maintained on the surface of the neutron stars due to effective dark matter capture. This interesting feature can also help reveal the nature of dark matter and possibly further improve the upper limit of dark matter scattering cross section well below $10^{-47}$ cm$^2$."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have become an indispensable tool for studying the Universe's ionisation properties, as well as its cosmological parameters. This is achieved by analysing their diffuse dispersion measure (${\\rm DM}_{\\rm diff}$) as a function of redshift. However, this requires an integration along the line-of-sight, which is time-consuming. In this work, we derive an analytical approximation formula for ${\\rm DM}_{\\rm diff}$ for flat, $Λ$CDM and $w$CDM universes. We show that our approximation works well for the ranges $0.01 \\leq z \\leq 2$, $0.2 \\leq Ω_m \\leq 1.0$ and $-3.0 \\leq w \\leq -0.5$, with relative fractional error to a numerically evaluated ${\\rm DM}_{\\rm diff}$ always smaller than $3.5\\ \\%$, in the worst case scenario, and in most cases smaller than $0.5\\ \\%$. Moreover, the approximation is more than $15$ ($2$) times faster than the numerical solution of $Λ$CDM ($w$CDM). Therefore, we hope that it could be a useful tool for the FRB community."}

Among these sources, the microquasar V4641 Sgr exhibits $γ$-ray emission up to $\\sim$0.8 PeV, requiring the acceleration of particles to multi-PeV energies, as well as the hardest UHE spectrum. The mechanisms behind particle acceleration to such energies are not well understood. Furthermore, the limited multi-wavelength (MWL) information on this source appears contradictory, further complicating interpretation and suggesting that V4641 Sgr may represent a particularly unusual case. In this work, we present a detailed physical model of V4641 Sgr that combines first-principles simulations of stochastic (turbulent) particle acceleration with MWL emission modeling. We adopt a leptonic scenario in which electrons are accelerated via the second-order Fermi process driven by relativistic strong turbulence ($δB/B \\sim 1$). The particle energization is simulated using a dedicated Monte Carlo framework STRIPE that incorporates the effects of intermittent energy gains and radiative losses. The resulting accelerated electrons produce UHE $γ$-rays through inverse Compton scattering on both the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the interstellar radiation fields (ISRF). Our model is capable of reproducing key observational characteristics of the system, including particle acceleration to energies of tens of PeV, as well as the TeV-PeV $γ$-ray spectrum and the hard spectral index measured by LHAASO. Nonetheless, several aspects remain unresolved, highlighting the need for deeper observational coverage and further theoretical refinement."}

They are mostly of extragalactic origin, but the progenitors, trigger mechanisms and radiation processes are still largely unknown. Here we present a comprehensive analysis on 415 non-repeating FRBs detected by CHIME, applying manual filtering to ensure sample completeness. It is found that the distribution of fluence can be approximated by a three-segment power-law function, with the power-law indices being $-3.76 \\pm 1.61$, $0.20 \\pm 0.68$ and $2.06 \\pm 0.90$ in the low, middle, and high fluence segments, respectively.

The redshifts are estimated from the extragalactic \\text{DM} by using the Macquart relation, which are found to peak at $ z \\sim 0.6$. The isotropic energy release ($E_{\\text{iso}}$) is also derived for each burst. Two-Gaussian components are revealed in the distribution of $E_{\\text{iso}}$, with the major population narrowly clustered at $\\sim 2.3 \\times 10^{40} {\\rm erg}$. The minor population have a characteristic energy of $\\sim 1.6 \\times 10^{39}$ erg and span approximately one order of magnitude. The distribution hints a near-uniform energy release mechanism for the dominant population as expected from some catastrophic channels, whereas the lower-energy component (potentially including repeat-capable sources) may reflect a broader diversity in FRB origins, emission mechanisms and evolutionary stages."}

Focusing on VHE emission, we investigated the spectral and temporal properties of VHE-detected FSRQs using 14-year Fermi-LAT data. All are highly variable (flux-amplitude$>$100) with VHE detection associated with brighter flux states and relatively harder spectra. Above a flux limit, flux anti-correlates with spectral index, exhibiting a bluer-when-brighter trend. The low-flux state spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for all resembles a power-law, while high-flux and VHE-associated states resemble a log-parabola, accompanied by an almost nil (PKS0736+017, PKS1510-089) to marginal (4C+21.35, 3C279) to significant (B21420+32, TON0599, PKS1441+25, S30218+35, PKS0346-27, OP313) MeV-GeV peak-upshift -- more prominent in high-redshift sources. For no/marginal peak-upshift, the VHE emission is consistent with external Comptonization of infrared photons (EC-IR) driven primarily by a power-law continuation of the particle spectrum to higher energies. For those with a significant MeV-GeV peak-upshift, PKS0346-27 and OP313 shows peak-upshift in the synchrotron spectrum, and thus VHE is EC-IR origin, while for others without synchrotron-peak upshift, we attribute the VHE to an HBL-like component with a Compton-Dominance (CD) like FSRQs, with VHE driven primarily by particle spectrum continuation. In some, even high-state SEDs seem to require an HBL-like component. Thus, VHE activities in FSRQs mainly result from particle spectrum continuation, aided by spectral transition or a new HBL-like component with FSRQ-like CD. Such spectral changes naturally brighten the GeV-VHE flux, overcoming extragalactic background light absorption without requiring extraordinary brightening under the traditional EC-IR scenario than normally exhibited."}

Submitted to Memorie della Società Astronomica Italiana (MemSAIt). Presented at the 8th Heidelberg International Symposium on High-Energy Gamma-Ray Astronomy (Gamma-2024), 2024", "summary": "The Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) is the accumulated light emitted throughout the history of the universe, spanning the UV, optical, and IR spectral ranges. Stars and dust in galaxies are expected to be the main source of the EBL. However, recent direct measurements performed beyond Pluto's orbit (less affected by foregrounds than those performed from the Earth) hint at an EBL level in the optical band larger than the one expected from the integrated contribution of known galaxy populations. One approach that could solve this controversy uses Very High Energy (VHE) photons coming from sources at cosmological distances. These photons can interact with the EBL producing electron-positron pairs, a process that leaves an imprint on the observed VHE spectrum. This technique, however, requires assumptions on the intrinsic spectrum of the source, which can compromise the robustness of EBL constraints. In this contribution, we used Monte Carlo simulations and archival data of the MAGIC telescopes to study the impact that the assumptions adopted in the literature have on the estimate of the EBL density, and how using more generic ones would modify the results. Our results show how the EBL density constraints obtained highly depend on the intrinsic spectral shape assumed for the source. We have studied two different methods to reduce the assumptions on the intrinsic spectral shape to get more robust results. This will be especially important for upcoming with new VHE facilities, where systematic uncertainties are expected to play a more significant role compared to statistical ones."}

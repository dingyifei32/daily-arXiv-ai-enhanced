Both black holes are also inferred to be rapidly\nspinning ($\\chi_1 \\simeq 0.9$, $\\chi_2 \\simeq 0.8$). The primary object in\nGW231123 is the heaviest stellar mass black hole detected to date, which,\ntogether with its extreme rotation, raises questions about its astrophysical\norigin. Accounting for the unusually large spin of $\\sim 0.9$ with hierarchical\nmergers requires some degree of fine tuning. We investigate whether such a\nmassive, highly spinning object could plausibly form from the collapse of a\nsingle rotating massive star. We simulate stars with an initial core mass of\n$160 \\rm M_\\odot$ -- sufficient to produce BH masses at the upper edge of the\n90% credible interval for $m_1$ in GW231123 -- across a range of rotation rates\nand $^{12}\\mathrm{C}(\\alpha,\\gamma)^{16}\\mathrm{O}$ reaction rates. We find\nthat: (i) rotation shifts the pair-instability mass gap to higher masses,\nintroducing a significant ingredient that correlates masses and spins in\ngravitational wave predictions; and (ii) highly spinning BHs with masses\n$\\gtrsim 150 \\rm M_\\odot$ can form above the mass gap, implying that stellar\nevolution alone is sufficient to explain GW231123. Our results suggest that the\nprimary object of GW231123 may be the first directly observed black hole that\nformed via direct core collapse following the photodisintegration instability."}

Since\nthen, numerous multi-messenger studies combining neutrino and photon data have\nbeen conducted, yet the origin of neutrinos from active galactic nuclei (AGN)\nremains uncertain.

To date, only a relatively small\nfraction of the known MSP population has been detected at frequencies below 300\nMHz, and nearly all previous MSP studies at these frequencies have been\nconducted with northern telescopes. We present a census of MSPs in the SMART\npulsar survey, covering declinations south of +30 deg at a centre frequency of\n154 MHz. We detected 40 MSPs, with 11 being the first published detections\nbelow 300 MHz. For each detection, we provide coherently-dedispersed\nfull-polarimetric integrated pulse profiles and mean flux densities. We\nmeasured significant Faraday rotation measures (RMs) for 25 MSPs, and\nidentified apparent phase-dependent RM variations for three MSPs. Comparison\nwith published profiles at other frequencies supports previous studies\nsuggesting that the pulse component separations of MSPs vary negligibly over a\nwide frequency range due to their compact magnetospheres. We observe that\nintegrated pulse profiles tend to be more polarised at low frequencies,\nconsistent with depolarisation due to superposed orthogonal polarisation modes.\nThe results of this census will be a valuable resource for planning future MSP\nmonitoring projects at low frequencies, and will also help to improve survey\nsimulations to forecast the detectable MSP population with the SKA-Low."}

Whereas most long GRBs are thought to\noriginate in the core collapse of massive stars, the presence of kilonova\nsuggests GRB 211211A was instead produced by a merger of a compact object\nbinary. Building on the interpretation put forward by\n\\citet{Yang2022Natur.612..232Y}--who argue that GRB 211211A was powered by a\nmassive white-dwarf + neutron-star (WD-NS) merger--we adopt this WD-NS scenario\nas our observationally supported starting point. If the burst truly originates\nfrom that channel, its rarity must mirror the formation and merger rate of\nWD-NS binaries--a rate still largely unexplored in conventional massive-binary\npopulation studies. In this letter, we present a qualitative analysis based on\nbinary evolution physics in order to understand the fraction of GRB 211211A in\nshort GRBs (NS-WD/NS-NS fraction). Since the progenitors of massive WD-NS\nbinaries occupy the initial mass function-preferred regime, where the zero-age\nmain-sequence mass range of the assumed WD mass range (1.2-1.4$\\,M_\\odot$) is\ncomparable to that of NSs, the NS-WD/NS-NS fraction emerging from our standard\nevolutionary path is expected to be $\\sim$14--37\\%, far higher than the\nobserved fraction ($\\sim5$\\%). This discrepancy might imply a large,\nstill-unidentified population of GRB 211211A-like events or an unusual origin\nof the NS-such as being hypernova-born or accretion-induced-collapse-born.\nPlacing these results in a broader compact-binary context, implications for\nblack-hole systems are also discussed."}

The most\nrecent significant revision of its properties took place in the late 1990s;\nhowever, further advances were limited by readily available data from this\nevent. Here we retrieved and analyzed decades of previously unpublished Ohio\nSETI observations, enabling the most comprehensive re-evaluation of the\nproperties of the Wow!

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "Type-Ia supernovae (SNe), or runaway thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs\n(WDs), play a critical role in the chemical evolution of galaxies, and are\nimportant cosmological distance indicators due to their 'standardizable'\nlightcurves. Growing evidence, however, suggests greater diversity in their\nobserved lightcurves (and spectra) than thought previously. This is usually\nattributed to a variety of WD explosion mechanisms and progenitor system\nproperties, but a direct link between the explosion mechanisms and Type-Ia SN\nobservables remains elusive. Here we present a novel approach to identify\nexplosion mechanisms of Type-Ia SNe, by analyzing the sizes of small-scale\nturbulent substructures of different elements in their extended ejecta, i.e.,\nin Supernova Remnants (SNRs). Our three-dimensional hydrodynamical models show\nthat substructures in an SNR dominated by iron-group elements may have a\ntypical size different from substructures dominated by intermediate mass\nelements (e.g., Si, S) in the same SNR. This size difference is governed by the\nexplosion mechanism. Applying this approach to Tycho's SNR, we find that its\nobserved structure is most consistent with the explosion of a sub-Chandrasekhar\nmass WD via the double-detonation mechanism. Extending this method to other\nwell-characterized SNRs can let us connect the inferred explosion mechanism to\nthe associated historical SNe, which often have spectra reconstructed through\nlight echo observations."}

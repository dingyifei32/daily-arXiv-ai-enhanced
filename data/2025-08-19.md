### [1] [Tera-Hertz Counterparts to Fast Radio Bursts from Coherent Cherenkov Radiation by Tilted Bunches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11736)
*Ze-Nan Liu,Wei-Yang Wang,Yu-Chen Huang,Zi-Gao Dai*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 本文扩展了相干切伦科夫辐射（CChR）框架，加入束流倾角和几何参数，以更精确模拟快速射电暴（FRB）和磁星的太赫兹（THz）辐射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速射电暴（FRBs）具有极高的亮度温度，暗示极端天体物理过程中的相干辐射机制。本文旨在通过改进CChR框架，更严格地模拟FRB和磁星的THz辐射。

Method: 扩展CChR框架，引入束流倾角和几何参数，模拟相对论性束流在磁星磁化等离子体中的相干辐射。

Result: 预测FRB可能伴随THz辐射，并解释了磁星SGR J1745-2900的THz辐射特征。

Conclusion: 通过毫米波望远镜（如ALMA、IRAM）探测THz辐射，有望揭示FRB与磁星之间的物理联系。

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration extragalactic transients
characterized by ultrahigh brightness temperatures, suggesting coherent
emission mechanisms in extreme astrophysical processes. In this paper, we
extend the bunched coherent Cherenkov radiation (CChR) framework by
incorporating bunch inclination and geometric configuration parameters,
enabling it to more rigorously model FRB emission and tera-Hertz (THz) emission
from magnetars. When relativistic bunches are injected into the magnetized
plasma of a magnetar's magnetosphere at the Cherenkov angle, their emitted
waves achieve phase coherence through constructive interference. Furthermore,
the three-dimensional geometry of the bunches plays a crucial role in
influencing the coherence of the radiation. Within the framework of CChR, we
predict the existence of THz emission counterparts associated with FRBs and
explain the observed characteristics of the THz-emitting magnetar SGR
J1745-2900. Detections of such counterparts by upgraded millimeter telescopes
(e.g., Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, IRAM) would be expected to
provide new insights into the potential physical connection between FRBs and
magnetars.

TL;DR: 论文通过多波段观测研究了II型超新星SN 2023ixf的前两年演化，发现其光变曲线在约500天后由放射性衰变主导转变为激波与周围物质相互作用主导，并估算了激波功率和尘埃质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究SN 2023ixf的长期演化过程，特别是激波与周围物质的相互作用及其对光谱和光变曲线的影响。

Method: 结合地面和空间望远镜的多波段观测数据，构建光谱能量分布，并使用非局部热平衡辐射转移代码CMFGEN进行建模。

Result: 发现SN 2023ixf在约500天后激波功率开始主导，并估算出激波功率和尘埃质量，模型能有效再现其光谱特性。

Conclusion: SN 2023ixf的长期演化由激波与周围物质的相互作用主导，且模型支持这一机制。

Abstract: We present multi-wavelength observations of the type II supernova (SN II)
2023ixf during its first two years of evolution. We combine ground-based
optical/NIR spectroscopy with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) far- and
near-ultraviolet spectroscopy and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) near- and
mid-infrared photometry and spectroscopy to create spectral energy
distributions of SN 2023ixf at +374 and +620 days post-explosion, covering a
wavelength range of ~0.1-30 $\mu$m. The multi-band light curve of SN 2023ixf
follows a standard radioactive decay decline rate after the plateau until ~500
days, at which point shock powered emission from ongoing interaction between
the SN ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM) begins to dominate. This
evolution is temporally consistent with 0.3-10 keV X-ray detections of SN
2023ixf and broad ''boxy'' spectral line emission from reprocessing of shock
luminosity in a cold dense shell located between forward and reverse shocks.
Using the expected absorbed radioactive decay power and the detected X-ray
luminosity, we quantify the total shock powered emission at the +374 and +620
day epochs and find that it can be explained by nearly complete thermalization
of the reverse shock luminosity as SN 2023ixf interacts with a continuous,
''wind-like'' CSM with a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\dot M \approx 10^{-4}$
M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($v_w = 20 \pm 5$ km/s). Additionally, we construct
multi-epoch spectral models from the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN,
which contain radioactive decay and shock powers, as well as dust absorption,
scattering, and emission. We find that models with shock powers of $L_{sh} =
(0.5-1) \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and $(0.5 - 1) \times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$
of silicate dust in the cold dense shell and/or inner SN ejecta can effectively
reproduce the global properties of the late-time (>300 days) UV-to-IR spectra
of SN 2023ixf.

### [3] [Hot, cold, and multi-component accretion flows around supermassive black hole binaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11748)
*Christopher Tiede,Daniel J. D'Orazio*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个超大质量黑洞双星（SMBHBs）在低于爱丁顿极限吸积时的模型，重点研究了热、对流主导的吸积流的光谱特征，并评估了其观测特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是为了理解多组分吸积流的光谱表现及其观测特征，特别是针对SMBHBs候选体的解释。

Method: 采用三盘模型计算了四种可能的吸积配置的光谱能量分布，并分析了其变异性特征。

Result: 模型显示双星吸积可以自洽地解释标准活动星系核的许多特性，变异性分析表明在热发射和低频同步辐射组分中可能出现周期性变化。

Conclusion: 该模型为解释SMBHBs候选体提供了一个框架，并激励了未来多波段观测和多组分吸积的详细建模。

Abstract: We develop a model for supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) accreting
below their Eddington limit, focusing on systems where hot, advection-dominated
flows become viable. We specifically explore the spectral appearance of
multi-component accretion flows where the solution can independently transition
between cold, thin disks and hot, advection-dominated torii depending on the
local accretion rate. Using a three-disk model, we compute spectral energy
distributions for four possible accretion configurations and assess their
observational signatures, including which frequencies might reflect variability
at the binary orbital period. The spectral modeling reveals that binary
accretion can self-consistently account for many of the properties of standard
AGN, while the variability analysis shows that hydrodynamic modulation at the
binary period is most likely in the thermal emission and low-frequency
synchrotron components. Doppler boosting of emitting material bound to a single
binary component would also induce periodic variability. We apply our model to
the SMBHB candidate PG1302-102 and demonstrate that a mixed-component accretion
state (plus a jet feature) can self-consistently capture the observed broadband
spectrum. Our model offers a framework for interpreting candidate SMBHBs and
motivates future multi-wavelength follow-up of potential multi-messenger
sources, as well as more detailed future modeling of multi-component binary
accretion.

TL;DR: 论文分析了SN~2023ixf和SN~2024ggi两颗II型超新星的紫外光谱，揭示了其发射线特征及演化过程，并通过辐射转移模型推断出爆炸前质量损失率的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究II型超新星的紫外光谱特征及其演化，以理解其爆炸机制和周围物质的相互作用。

Method: 通过观测远紫外和近紫外光谱，结合光学和紫外发射线轮廓的比较，并利用辐射转移模型分析数据。

Result: 发现超新星的紫外发射线由两个速度轮廓演变为单一轮廓，表明冲击波功率逐渐主导；模型推断出爆炸前质量损失率显著增加。

Conclusion: 超新星SN~2023ixf和SN~2024ggi在爆炸前的质量损失率显著增加，冲击波功率逐渐主导其能量来源。

Abstract: We present far- and near-ultraviolet (UV) spectra of the Type II supernovae
(SNe) SN~2023ixf from days 199 to 722 and SN~2024ggi at days 41 and 232. Both
supernovae show broad, blueshifted, and asymmetric UV emission lines with an
initial maximum velocity of $\sim9000\,km\,s^{-1}$ and narrow unresolved
emission in CIV. We compare the optical and UV emission-line profiles, showing
that they evolve from two distinct velocity profiles to a single profile
tracing the UV emission. We interpret this as shock power from interaction with
circumstellar material coming to dominate over the radioactive-decay power from
the inner ejecta. Comparing our observations to radiative transfer models with
injected shock power, we find SN~2024ggi is best matched by $P_{\mathrm{shock,
abs}}=1\times10^{41}\,erg\,s^{-1}$ at day 40, SN~2023ixf at day 300 and
SN~2024ggi at day 200 are best matched by
$P_{\mathrm{shock,abs}}=1\times10^{40}\,erg\,s^{-1}$, and SN~2023ixf at day 600
is best matched by $P_{\mathrm{shock,abs}}=5\times10^{39}\,erg\,s^{-1}$. From
these models, we find the mass-loss rate of both supernovae increased just
before explosion. For SN~2023ixf our mass-loss rates go from
$4\times10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ at 600 yr before explosion to
$2\times10^{-2}\,M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ at 15 yr prior to explosion. For
SN~2024ggi, we find a mass-loss rate of $9\times10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ at
150 yr before explosion and $1\times10^{-3}\,M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ at 30 yr
before explosion.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究探讨了M87*黑洞周围磁场几何对可观测同步辐射的影响，发现磁场构型对EHT观测结果有显著影响，而盘厚度影响较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解黑洞吸积流和喷流形成中磁场的作用，为EHT观测提供理论框架。

Method: 采用半解析辐射无效吸积流模型，结合广义相对论射线追踪和偏振辐射传输，生成M87*合成图像。

Result: 磁场构型（极向或环向主导）对观测结果影响显著，而盘厚度影响有限。M87*更符合极向磁场主导的流动。

Conclusion: M87*系统倾向于极向磁场主导的流动，黑洞自旋虽不明确，但倾向于中等或较大的正值。

Abstract: Context: Magnetic fields play a pivotal role in dynamics of black hole
accretion flows and formation of relativistic jets. Observations by the Event
Horizon Telescope (EHT) provided unprecedented insights into accretion
structures near black holes. Interpreting these observations requires a
theoretical framework linking polarized emission to underlying system
properties and magnetic field geometries. Aims: We investigate how system
properties, particularly magnetic field geometry in the event horizon scale
region, influence the structure of the observable synchrotron emission in M87*.
Specifically, we aim to quantify the sensitivity of observables used by the EHT
to black hole spin, plasma dynamics, accretion disk thickness, and magnetic
field geometry. Methods: We adopt a semi-analytic radiatively inefficient
accretion flow model in Kerr spacetime. We vary magnetic field geometry, black
hole spin, accretion disk dynamics, and geometric thickness of the disk. We
perform general relativistic ray tracing with a full polarized radiative
transfer to obtain synthetic images of M87*. We extract EHT observables, such
as disk diameter, asymmetry, and polarimetric metrics from synthetic models. We
also consider a number of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations
and compare them with the semi-analytical models. Results: We see limited
impact of the disk thickness on observables. On the other hand, toroidal field
dominated and poloidal field dominated magnetic configurations can be
distinguished reliably. The flow dynamics, in particular presence of radial
inflow, also significantly impacts the EHT observables. Conclusions: The M87*
system is most consistent with a poloidal magnetic field dominated flow with
partially radial inflow. While the spin remain elusive, moderate or large
positive values are preferred.

*Q. Daniel Wang,Juergen Ott*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 通过多波段观测发现KUG~1138+327附近的背景年轻星系团，揭示了一个异常的X射线特征和AGN反馈的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究KUG~1138+327附近的扩散发射，以理解其异常X射线特征和可能的星系团背景。

Method: 使用Chandra ACIS-S X射线观测（0.3-7 keV）、低频阵列和VLA射电数据（120-168 MHz和1-2 GHz）进行分析。

Result: 发现一个硬X射线谱的扩散特征，解释为年轻星系团的热等离子体；检测到一个射电瓣，表明AGN反馈对星系团介质的影响。

Conclusion: 研究确认了一个背景年轻星系团的存在，并强调了偏离中心的AGN反馈在塑造星系团介质中的潜在重要性。

Abstract: Using a 90 ks Chandra ACIS-S observation in the 0.3--7 keV band, along with
complementary Low-Frequency Array and Karl G.~Jansky Very Large Array data in
the 120--168 MHz and 1--2 GHz ranges, we study the diffuse emission around the
nearby dwarf galaxy KUG~1138+327. Our analysis reveals a diffuse X-ray feature
on the southern side, disconnected from the galactic disk. This feature
exhibits a hard X-ray spectrum, which is highly unusual for an outflow from a
dwarf galaxy. We interpret the irregularly shaped feature as hot plasma in a
young galaxy cluster at redshift 0.5, supported by X-ray spectral fitting and
consistent with the optical redshift of the central elliptical galaxy of a
known cluster identified by a red sequence. Additionally, we detect a radio
lobe east of the X-ray feature, likely produced by an AGN offset from the
cluster center and confined primarily by ram pressure from the ambient medium.
The lobe shows a steep nonthermal radio spectrum, suggesting a cosmic-ray age
of $\gtrsim 5 \times 10^{7}$~yr. Assuming energy equipartition between cosmic
rays and magnetic fields, we estimate the lobe's total energy to be $\sim 9
\times 10^{56}~\mathrm{erg}$, comparable to the thermal energy in the same
volume. This study thus identifies a background young cluster projected next to
KUG~1138+327 and highlights the potentially significant role of off-center AGN
feedback in shaping the intracluster medium.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究了高红移（z≥10）超大质量黑洞（SMBH）的生长，包括暗物质捕获、黑洞合并和气体吸积。发现暗物质捕获在某些情况下对SMBH质量的贡献可达一个数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索SMBH在高红移下的生长机制，尤其是暗物质捕获对其质量的潜在重要贡献。

Method: 结合暗物质捕获、黑洞合并和气体吸积模型，分析SMBH的生长过程，特别关注暗物质的作用。

Result: 暗物质捕获显著增加了SMBH的质量，尤其是在密集核星团中，小种子黑洞更容易在z=10时达到>10^7 M⊙。

Conclusion: 暗物质捕获是SMBH生长的重要机制，特别是在高红移环境下，对理解SMBH形成具有重要意义。

Abstract: We investigate the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high
redshift ($z \ge 10$) from a combination of dark matter capture, black-hole
mergers, and gas accretion. It has previously been shown that SMBHs can form by
$z \approx 10$ via black-hole mergers, Eddington-limited Bondi gas accretion
and tidal disruption events with stars within dense nuclear clusters. Here, we
show that the capture of collisionless dark matter by a growing SMBH also
substantially contributes, in some cases by an order of magnitude to the final
SMBH mass. In particular, we show that a small seed stellar-remnant black hole
can more easily reach $> 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ by $z = 10$ in the core of dense
nuclear star clusters when dark matter is included. This remains true for
either cold dark matter or ultralight dark matter if the mass of the ULDM
particle is $^>_\sim 10^{-20}$ eV. We highlight the unique evolution of ULDM
capture by the growing SMBH when the ULDM de Broglie wavelength exceeds the
initial nuclear star cluster half-mass radius.

TL;DR: 论文研究了利用第三代引力波探测器通过Fisher信息矩阵方法对中子星状态方程（EoS）和核性质的约束。结果显示EoS在高密度区域约束较好，但低密度区域约束较弱，且核性质存在退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索第三代引力波探测器在约束中子星状态方程和核性质方面的潜力，以增进对致密物质的理解。

Method: 使用Fisher信息矩阵方法，模拟一年观测的双中子星合并引力波信号，计算协方差矩阵和后验分布。

Result: EoS在1-4倍核饱和密度范围内约束较好，但低密度区域约束较弱，核性质因退化问题难以单独通过引力波观测约束。

Conclusion: 仅靠引力波信号难以全面约束致密物质性质，需结合半径测量、合并后引力波观测及核实验数据。

Abstract: We investigate the constraints on the neutron star equation of state (EoS)
and nuclear properties achievable with third-generation gravitational wave
detectors using the Fisher information matrix approach. Assuming an optimistic
binary neutron star (BNS) merger rate, we generate synthetic inspiral
gravitational wave (GW) signals corresponding to one year of observation. From
these simulated data, we compute the covariance matrix and posterior
distributions for nuclear properties and EoS. Our results show that the EoS can
be tightly constrained, particularly in the density range between one and four
times nuclear saturation density. However, due to the scarcity of of low-mass
neutron stars in the GW sample, the EoS at sub-saturation densities remains
poorly constrained. Thus, in turn, leads to weaker constraints on neutron star
radii, as the radii are sensitive to the low-density EoS. Additionally, We note
that the nuclear properties are degenerate in their influence on the EoS,
making them difficult to be constrained through GW observations alone. These
highlights inherent limitations of inspiral GW signals in probing dense matter
properties. Therefore, precise radius measurements, post-merger GW
observations, and supplementary constraints from terrestrial nuclear
experiments remain essential for a comprehensive understanding of dense matter.

TL;DR: 比较了持久性黑洞X射线双星Cygnus X-1与瞬态黑洞X射线双星MAXI J1820+070的光谱-时序特性，发现两者在软滞后、低频硬滞后和rms光谱演化上存在显著差异，可能与吸积率和光度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Cygnus X-1与瞬态黑洞X射线双星在硬态下的光谱-时序特性差异，以探索其物理机制。

Method: 结合XMM-Newton、NICER和INTEGRAL数据，分析功率谱、rms光谱和时间滞后，覆盖0.5-200 keV范围。

Result: Cygnus X-1在1-10 Hz范围内未检测到软滞后，且低频硬滞后和rms光谱演化更强，差异可能与吸积率和光度相关。

Conclusion: 黑洞X射线双星的硬态下，日冕几何可能存在显著的光度依赖性，而非Cygnus X-1与瞬态系统间的固有差异。

Abstract: Cygnus X-1 is a persistent, high-mass black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) which
in the hard state shows many similar properties to transient BHXRBs, along with
intriguing differences, such as the lack of quasi-periodic oscillations. Here,
we compare for the first time the detailed spectral-timing properties of Cyg
X-1 with a transient BHXRB, MAXI J1820+070, combining data from XMM-Newton and
NICER with contemporaneous INTEGRAL data to study the power spectra, rms
spectra and time-lags over a broad 0.5 - 200 keV range. We select bright hard
state MAXI J1820+070 data with similar power-spectral shapes to the Cyg X-1
data, to compare the source behaviours while accounting for the evolution of
spectral-timing properties, notably the lags, through the hard state. Cyg X-1
shows no evidence for soft lags in the 1 - 10 Hz frequency range where they are
clearly detected for MAXI J1820+070. Furthermore the low-frequency hard lags
and rms-spectra evolve much more strongly during the hard state of Cyg X-1 than
for MAXI J1820+070. We argue that these differences cannot be explained by the
different black hole masses of these systems, but may be related to their
different accretion rates and corresponding locations on the hardness-intensity
diagram. We conjecture that there is a significant luminosity-dependence of
coronal geometry in the hard state of BHXRBs, rather than an intrinsic
difference between Cyg X-1 and transient BHXRBs. This possibility has also been
suggested to explain a common time-lag feature that appears in the hard
intermediate states of Cyg X-1 and transient BHXRBs.

Method: 通过种群合成研究各种磁星形成通道，分析双星系统中磁星的几何对齐情况。

Result: 研究表明宇宙中少数百分比的磁星可能存在于双星系统中，这些系统能解释活跃重复FRB的丰富现象学。

Abstract: The association between FRB 20200428D and the Galactic magnetar SGR
J1935+2154 makes magnetars the leading engine of cosmological fast radio bursts
(FRBs). However, there is a list of puzzles for this magnetar-for-all-FRBs
scenario: known Galactic magnetars are all isolated and none of them are active
repeaters; some cosmological repeaters have extremely high repetition rates but
without any measurable spin-related periodicity; some show long-term periodic
active windows; and some show diverse rotation measure (RM) evolution patterns,
such as quasi-periodic fluctuations, sign reversals, and abrupt RM flares. Here
we propose a unified theoretical framework for FRBs within the framework of
magnetar engine: Most active repeating FRBs originate from magnetars in binary
systems with nearly aligned rotation and magnetic axes, some of which with a
triple-aligned geometry, i.e. with an alignment with the orbital axis as well;
whereas apparent non-repeaters and inactive repeaters originate from magnetars
in isolated systems or in binaries with a misaligned geometry. By studying
various magnetar formation channels using population syntheses, we show that a
few percent of magnetars in the universe can be in binary systems, most with a
massive star companion and some with aligned geometry. We suggest that such
binary systems can account for the rich phenomenology of active repeaters. We
suggest that the existence of a companion helps to maintain the aligned
geometry and that the companion may play an active role in triggering FRBs in
an active repeater source.

Motivation: 探索磁星壳层地震作为触发磁层瞬变现象的机制，并理解其对磁星爆发和快速射电暴的可能触发作用。

Method: 结合解析分析和三维数值模拟，研究高频磁弹性波在壳层中的传播，并考虑磁层和液态核的磁耦合效应。

Result: 地震波在壳层和核心界面间以约1 kHz频率反弹，磁耦合导致阻尼时间约10 ms。非轴对称地震会向磁层发射混合的阿尔芬波和快速磁声波。

Conclusion: 研究结果对解释磁星爆发和快速射电暴的触发机制具有重要意义，表明地震波传播和阻尼特性是关键因素。

Abstract: Crust quakes are frequently invoked as a mechanism to trigger sudden
transients in the magnetospheres of magnetars. In this picture, a mechanical
failure of the crust excites seismic motions of the magnetar surface that
launch force-free waves into the magnetosphere. We first investigate this
problem analytically and then perform three-dimensional numerical simulations.
Our simulations follow the propagation of high-frequency magneto-elastic waves
in the entire crust, and include magnetic coupling to the dipolar magnetosphere
and liquid core through simplified radiation boundary conditions. We observe
seismic waves bouncing between the crust-core interface and the surface with a
characteristic frequency $\sim 1$ kHz, which could appear as a modulation of
the magnetospheric radiation. Both the star quake and its associated
magnetospheric wave emission are strongly damped on a timescale $\sim 10 \ \rm
ms$ by magnetic coupling to the liquid core. Since seismic waves are
significantly damped before they can spread laterally around the crust,
magnetospheric wave emission occurs primarily near the initial epicenter of the
quake. Our simulations suggest that non-axisymmetric quakes will launch a
mixture of Alfv\'en and fast magnetosonic waves into the magnetosphere. The
results will be important for interpreting magnetar bursts and understanding
the possible trigger mechanisms of fast radio bursts.

Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA consortium has sporadically detected purely inspiral
gravitational-wave events like GW170817 and GW190425. These events offer an
opportunity to constrain the presence of possible initial (residual) orbital
eccentricities while using purely inspiral template families. We detail the
implementation of a LSC Algorithm Library Suite approximant, TaylorF2Ecck,
which models analytically inspiral gravitational waves from non-spinning
compact binaries in Post-Newtonian accurate eccentric orbits while restricting
the initial-eccentricity contributions to its leading order. Specifically, our
frequency domain approximant consistently incorporates the orbital, advance of
periastron, and gravitational-wave emission effects fully up to the 3PN order.
We pursue detailed parameter estimation studies of GW170817 and GW190425 using
TaylorF2Ecck, after performing comprehensive sanity checks to validate the
model's performance and investigate the influence of periastron advance in the
relevant parameter space. The results indicate that initial-eccentricity at 20
Hz is essentially zero (less than 0.011 for GW170817 and less than 0.028 for
GW190425) at a 90 percent confidence level. We compare posteriors for these two
events that arise from a few purely inspiral eccentric approximants and point
out certain subtle effects arising due to the inclusion of periastron advance.
Additionally, these detailed studies reveal the importance of incorporating
initial eccentricity contributions at least up to 3.5PN-order and discuss its
implications. We substantiate this inference by employing versions of
quasi-circular TaylorF2 approximant that incorporate Fourier phase
contributions beyond the conventional 3.5PN order.

Motivation: 探讨超新星前身星的逃逸运动如何影响SNR在银河系中的分布及其对整体种群性质推断的影响。

Method: 通过蒙特卡洛模拟构建银河系SNR种群，考虑前身星的逃逸运动和演化历史，并计算其伽马射线辐射，与H.E.S.S.银河平面巡天数据对比。

Result: 逃逸运动显著改变SNR在极高能波段的辐射可探测性，最佳拟合模型显示33%的大质量逃逸星比例与观测数据一致。

Conclusion: 逃逸运动是研究SNR种群及其非热辐射可探测性的关键因素，需在未来巡天中予以考虑。

Abstract: Context. A significant fraction (~30%) of massive stars in our Galaxy are
moving supersonically through the interstellar medium, which strongly governs
their location at the time they end their lives, e.g. die as a supernova and
give birth to a supernova remnant (SNR). These dead stellar environments
accelerate particles, emitting by non-thermal mechanisms up to the TeV range,
and they are considered as a major contributor to the very-high-energy band of
the local cosmic-ray spectrum.
  Aims. This study investigates the effect of the runaway motion of supernova
progenitors on the spatial distribution of SNRs in the Milky Way and how this
influences the deduced properties of the population.
  Methods. We construct Galactic populations of SNRs by Monte Carlo simulation,
taking into account the bulk motion and the evolution history of their
progenitor stars once ejected from their parent clusters. The gamma-ray domain
emission of each population is then calculated, to be compared with the High
Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) Galactic Plane Survey.
  Results. We find that including the runaway motion of supernova progenitors
strongly modifies the detectability of the simulated emission of their remnants
in the very-high-energy band. Particularly, our best fit model using a Reid
Milky Way model for core-collapse supernova progenitors requires 33% of massive
runaway stars, which is close to the known fraction of runaway high-mass stars,
to be in accordance with the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey data.
  Conclusions. Our results show that the runaway nature of supernova
progenitors must be taken into account in the study of the Galactic population
of SNRs within the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey and the forthcoming Galactic
Plane Survey of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, as it is a governing
factor of the detectability of non-thermal emission of their subsequent SNRs.

Motivation: 研究中子星热核爆发的物理特性，特别是光球半径膨胀和能量依赖性，以理解中子星及其周围环境的性质。

Method: 利用NICER和XMM-Newton观测数据，进行时间分辨光谱分析，采用可变持续辐射方法和吸积盘反射模型。

Result: 发现光球半径膨胀至23.1公里，温度降至1.4 keV；XMM-Newton数据未显示PRE特征；NuSTAR观测揭示了X射线反射特征。

Conclusion: 热核爆发的光谱特性支持吸积盘反射模型，中子星的磁场强度估计为5.1×10^8 G。

Abstract: We perform a comprehensive study of thermonuclear bursts from the neutron
star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1702-429 detected with NICER and XMM-Newton. The
thermonuclear burst detected with NICER shows clear evidence of a photospheric
radius expansion (PRE) event and a distinct feature in the burst profile. The
burst profiles demonstrate significant energy dependence, with the hardness
ratio varying notably during the PRE phase. The radius of the neutron star
photosphere expanded to a maximum of $23.1_{-3.2}^{+3.8}$ km while its
temperature reached a minimum of 1.4 keV. The time-resolved burst spectra can
be modeled using variable persistent emission method, indicating that the soft
excess may arise from enhanced mass accretion onto the neutron star,
potentially due to the Poynting-Robertson drag. Alternatively, the disk
reflection model can be used to explain the soft excess emission during a
burst. The time-resolved spectral study is performed for three thermonuclear
bursts detected with XMM-Newton. The XMM-Newton time-resolved burst spectra can
be modeled using an absorbed blackbody model, without any signatures of the
PRE. We conduct a detailed spectral analysis of the 2025 NuSTAR observation of
4U 1702-429, revealing a broad iron line at 6.4 keV and a Compton hump around
20 keV, indicating X-ray reflection features. The disk reflection model relxill
provides an inner disk radius of 12 $R_g$ and an inclination angle of
$\sim39^{\circ}$. The magnetic field strength at the pole of the neutron star
is estimated to be 5.1 $\times10^8$ G, assuming that the accretion disk is
truncated at magnetosphere boundary.

Motivation: 探索行星状星云（PNe）中的X射线发射，以揭示低中质量恒星演化的晚期阶段。

Method: 利用SRG eROSITA-DE eRASS1源目录和HASH PNe数据库进行交叉搜索。

Result: 发现5个已知X射线PNe，2个新PNe，移除1个，11个未检测到；eROSITA灵敏度约为2×10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1。

Conclusion: X射线PNe在HASH True PNe中的出现频率约为0.5%，eROSITA对高X射线通量的PNe更敏感。

Abstract: Some planetary nebulae (PNe) host X-ray-emitting hot bubbles shaped by
stellar wind interactions and/or harbor X-ray-emitting central stars due to
accretion, shocks within their fast stellar winds, or even chromospheric
emission from binary companions. In both cases, the properties of the X-ray
emission critically probe late-stages of stellar evolution for such low- and
intermediate-mass stars. While extant Chandra and XMM-Newton observations have
detected X-ray emission in PNe, the numbers known remain very small ($\sim40$)
compared to the overall Galactic PNe population ($\sim4000$). We have initiated
a project aimed at increasing the sample of known PNe with X-ray emission using
both current and new space-based X-ray telescopes such as the Einstein probe.
To further investigate their X-ray properties to elucidate what drives current
X-ray PN detections, we have cross-searched the SRG {\it eROSITA-DE} eRASS1
source catalogue and Hong Kong (HASH) PNe Database. Five known X-ray PNe have
been detected (Abell\,30, NGC\,2392, NGC\,3242, NGC\,5315, and LoTr\,5), two
new X-ray PNe are revealed (IC\,1297 and NGC\,2867), one (K\,1-27) is removed
from previous X-ray compilations, and another 11 previously detected X-ray
emitting PNe are not recovered. A comparison of the X-ray flux of detected and
undetected X-ray PNe reveals that eROSITA eRASS1 is sensitive to PNe with X-ray
fluxes larger than $\approx2\times10^{-14}$ erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. The
frequency of occurrence is $\simeq$0.5\% among the 1430 HASH True PNe in the
eRASS1 footprint.

Motivation: 探索FXT EP250207b的起源，以确定其是否与塌缩星或双致密天体合并相关。

Method: 利用VLT/MUSE光谱分析附近星系，结合X射线、光学和射电观测数据，与多种瞬变天体模型对比。

Result: EP250207b的光学对应体亮度不支持塌缩星起源，更符合双致密天体合并模型，但晚期光学/NIR辐射超出预期。

Conclusion: EP250207b可能是首例与双致密天体合并一致的FXT，增加了FXT与GRB的相似性。

Abstract: Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) are short-lived extra-galactic X-ray sources.
Recent progress through multi-wavelength follow-up of Einstein Probe discovered
FXTs has shown that several are related to collapsars, which can also produce
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In this paper we investigate the nature of the FXT
EP250207b. The VLT/MUSE spectra of a nearby (15.9 kpc in projection) lenticular
galaxy reveal no signs of recent star formation. If this galaxy is indeed the
host, EP250207b lies at a redshift of z=0.082, implying a peak observed
absolute magnitude for the optical counterpart of M_r=-14.5. At the time when
supernovae (SNe) would peak, it is substantially fainter than all SN types.
These results are inconsistent with a collapsar origin for EP250207b. The
properties favour a binary compact object merger driven origin. The X-ray,
optical and radio observations are compared with predictions of several types
of extra-galactic transients, including afterglow and kilonova models. The data
can be fit with a slightly off-axis viewing angle afterglow. However, the
late-time (~30 day) optical/NIR counterpart is too bright for the afterglow and
also for conventional kilonova models. This could be remedied if that late
emission is due to a globular cluster or the core of a (tidally disrupted)
dwarf galaxy. If confirmed, this would be the first case where the
multi-wavelength properties of an FXT are found to be consistent with a compact
object merger origin, increasing the parallels between FXTs and GRBs. We
finally discuss if the source could originate in a higher redshift host galaxy.

Conclusion: 高磁化喷流可能是低辐射效率的原因，相关模型已开源为Julia包“Magglow”。

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts early afterglows are important tracers for determining the
radial structure and magnetization of the ejecta. In this paper, we focus on
GRB 110213A that shows double-peaked optical afterglow lightcurves and the
shallow decay feature of the X-ray afterglow. We adopt a semi-analytic model
for the dynamics of forward and reverse shocks generated through an interaction
between an arbitrary magnetized ejecta with a finite thickness and a stratified
circumstellar medium. Multiwavelength radiation from forward and reverse shocks
seen from an arbitrary viewing angle is calculated under a thin-shell
approximation. Our analysis with multimodal nested sampling methods for GRB
110213A suggests that the thick shell ejecta naturally explains the shallow
decay feature of the X-ray afterglow. The combination of the reverse shock
emission in the strongly magnetized jet and forward shock emission in the
weakly magnetized circumstellar medium makes the double peak feature of the
optical afterglows. The estimated low radiative efficiency in the prompt phase
may be a consequence of the high magnetization of the jet in this case. A
multi-messenger emission simulator based on the magnetic bullet afterglow model
is publicly available as the open source Julia package "Magglow".

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Kolmogorov-Arnold Network（KAN）的新型21 cm宇宙学信号模拟器21cmKAN，具有极快的训练速度和接近最准确模拟器21cmLSTM的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了快速且高精度地分析21 cm模型的物理参数，以全面表征模型特征空间并对早期宇宙进行稳健约束。

Method: 利用KAN学习表达性变换，而非传统全连接神经网络的静态函数，适用于低维物理问题。21cmKAN通过可学习的、数据驱动的变换和较少的可训练参数实现高效模拟。

Result: 21cmKAN平均预测时间为3.7毫秒，训练速度比21cmLSTM快75倍，训练时间少于30分钟，并能获得无偏后验分布。其透明架构便于结果解释和验证。

Conclusion: KAN在快速准确模拟昂贵物理仿真方面优于其他神经网络类型，展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), we present a novel emulator of
the global 21 cm cosmology signal, $\texttt{21cmKAN}$, that provides extremely
fast training speed while achieving nearly equivalent accuracy to the most
accurate emulator to date, $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$. The combination of enhanced
speed and accuracy facilitated by $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ enables rapid and highly
accurate physical parameter estimation analyses of multiple 21 cm models, which
is needed to fully characterize the complex feature space across models and
produce robust constraints on the early universe. Rather than using static
functions to model complex relationships like traditional fully-connected
neural networks do, KANs learn expressive transformations that can perform
significantly better for low-dimensional physical problems. $\texttt{21cmKAN}$
predicts a given signal for two well-known models in the community in 3.7 ms on
average and trains about 75 times faster than $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$, when
utilizing the same typical GPU. $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ is able to achieve these
speeds because of its learnable, data-driven transformations and its relatively
small number of trainable parameters compared to a memory-based emulator. We
show that $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ required less than 30 minutes to train and fit
these simulated signals and obtain unbiased posterior distributions. We find
that the transparent architecture of $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ allows us to
conveniently interpret and further validate its emulation results in terms of
the sensitivity of the 21 cm signal to each physical parameter. This work
demonstrates the effectiveness of KANs and their ability to more quickly and
accurately mimic expensive physical simulations in comparison to other types of
neural networks.

Motivation: 解决星系功率谱中LPnG参数$f_{\rm NL}$与偏差参数$b_{\phi}$之间的简并性问题，并理解星系偏差的非普遍性。

Method: 使用Separate Universe框架分析暗物质晕的偏差行为，并通过$N$-体模拟验证理论。

Result: 发现质量选择的暗物质晕偏差具有普遍性，而浓度选择的低质量晕偏差则表现出非普遍性。

Conclusion: 高红移、高偏差星系观测中的非普遍性可能是选择函数的假象。

Abstract: Constraints on local primordial non-Gaussianity (LPnG) obtained from galaxy
power spectra are limited by the perfect degeneracy between the LPnG parameter
$f_{\rm NL}$ and the bias parameter $b_{\phi}$ which encodes the response of
galaxy clustering to a change in the amplitude of primordial curvature
fluctuations. For galaxies observed by galaxy surveys, the relation between
$b_{\phi}$ and the galaxy bias $b_{g}$ is poorly understood and differs
significantly from the universal mass function ansatz. In this paper, we
investigate this non-universality in the context of dark-matter halos using the
Separate Universe framework, focussing on dark-matter halos selected by mass
and/or concentration. We show that the Separate Universe framework provides a
natural explanation of the observed universality in the bias of dark-matter
halos selected purely by their mass, independent of the spherical collapse
picture of halo formation. We further propose an explanation for the observed
non-universality in halos selected by concentration and corroborate it with
$N$-body simulations in scale-free (EdS) and $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ cosmologies.
In particular, we show that the relation between $b_{\phi}$ and halo bias
$b_{h}$ for halos selected by concentration in matter-dominated cosmologies
tends towards universality at the highest halo masses due to such halos
gravitationally dominating their environment throughout their evolution. We
also argue that concentration-selected halos of lower masses exhibit
non-universality due to their mass accretion being significantly affected by
the gravitational influence of neighbouring, more massive halos. Our results
suggest that any non-universality in high redshift ($z\gtrsim 3$), high-bias
objects observed by realistic galaxy surveys is entirely an artifact of the
associated selection function.

Motivation: 研究贝叶斯和频率派方法在宇宙学参数推断中的差异，特别是在扩展模型（如$w_0w_a$CDM）中先验选择的影响。

Conclusion: 频率派方法在扩展模型中更稳健，贝叶斯方法对先验敏感，尤其在$w_0w_a$CDM模型中需谨慎使用。

Abstract: We perform a frequentist analysis using the standard profile likelihood
method for clustering measurements from Data Release 1 of the Dark Energy
Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). While Bayesian inferences for Effective Field
Theory models of galaxy clustering can be highly sensitive to the choice of
priors for extended cosmological models, frequentist inferences are not
susceptible to such effects. We compare Bayesian and frequentist constraints
for the parameter set $\{\sigma_8, H_0, \Omega_{\rm{m}}, w_0, w_a\}$ when
fitting to the full-shape of the power spectrum multipoles, the
post-reconstruction Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, as well as
external datasets from the CMB and type Ia supernovae measurements. Bayesian
prior effects are very significant for the $w_0w_a$CDM model; while the $1
\sigma$ frequentist confidence intervals encompass the maximum a posteriori
(MAP), the Bayesian credible intervals almost always exclude the maximum
likelihood estimate (MLE) and the MAP - indicating strong prior volume
projection effects - unless supernovae data are included. We observe limited
prior effects for the $\Lambda$CDM model, due to the reduced number of
parameters. When DESI full-shape and BAO data are jointly fit, we obtain the
following $1\sigma$ frequentist confidence intervals for $\Lambda$CDM
($w_0w_a$CDM): $\sigma_8 = 0.867^{+0.048}_{-0.041} , \ H_0 =
68.91^{+0.80}_{-0.79} \ \rm{km \ s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}} , \ \Omega_{\rm{m}} =

0.369^{+0.029}_{-0.059}$ , $w_0 = -0.24^{+0.17}_{-0.64}$ , $w_a =

(1.9$\sigma$, 3.4$\sigma$, 5.6$\sigma$, 5.5$\sigma$, 5.6$\sigma$) shifts
between the MLE relative to the Bayesian posterior mean for $\Lambda$CDM

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点源污染是CMB B模式偏振观测中的主要干扰源，可能对张量-标量比r的估计产生偏差，尤其是在小口径望远镜中。

Method: GPSF方法利用完整的像素域协方差（包括非对角项），并建模重叠源，以在真实条件下准确估计通量。

Result: GPSF显著减少了点源污染对r估计的偏差（从1.67×10^-3降至2.9×10^-4），同时仅增加2%的标准差。

Conclusion: GPSF是一种有前景的方法，适用于未来旨在测量r∼10^-3的CMB实验。

Abstract: Observations of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) B-mode polarization provide
a way to probe primordial gravitational waves and test inflationary
predictions. Extragalactic point sources become a major source of contamination
after delensing and can bias estimates of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ at the
$10^{-3}$ level. We introduce Generalized Point Spread Function Fitting (GPSF),
a method for removing point-source contamination in polarization maps. GPSF
uses the full pixel-domain covariance, including off-diagonal terms, and models
overlapping sources. This allows accurate flux estimation under realistic
conditions, particularly for small-aperture telescopes with large beams that
are more susceptible to source blending. We test GPSF on simulated sky maps,
apply foreground cleaning using the Needlet Internal Linear Combination (NILC)
method, and compare its performance with standard masking and inpainting. The
results show GPSF reduces point-source contamination without significantly
affecting the background signal, as seen in both the maps and their power
spectra. For the constraint on $r$, GPSF reduces the bias from $1.67 \times
10^{-3}$ to $2.9 \times 10^{-4}$, with only a 2% increase in standard
deviation. Compared to inpainting and masking, GPSF yields lower bias while
maintaining comparable variance. This suggests that it may serve as a promising
method for future CMB experiments targeting measurements of $r \sim 10^{-3}$.

(1+z)^3 across a range of Omega_m,0. For each of five two-parameter
equation-of-state (EoS) forms: Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL),
Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Linear-z, and
Logarithmic-z, we derive the analytic dark energy factor x_de(z), embed the
trained surrogate within a GPU-accelerated likelihood pipeline, and sample the
posterior of (h0, Omega_m,0, w0, wa, M0) using the emcee ensemble sampler with
the full Pantheon+ covariance. All parameterizations remain consistent with a
cosmological constant (w0 = -1, wa = 0) at the 95% credible level, with the
tightest bounds from the CPL form. While the surrogate does not reduce
computation time for a single run in simple models, it becomes advantageous for
repeated analyses of the same EoS or for models with expensive likelihood
evaluations, and can be shared as a reusable tool with different datasets
within the training range of SNe redshifts. This flexibility makes the approach
a scalable tool for future cosmological inference, especially in regimes where
conventional ODE-based methods are computationally prohibitive.

Conclusion: 空洞的形成和快速膨胀阻止了物质的径向吸积，导致巨型星系停滞和淬灭。空洞表面椭圆星系的丰度可能作为暗能量的探测工具。

Abstract: We report a numerical discovery that the formations of cosmic voids are
closely linked with the mechanism through which the giant galaxies on void
surfaces establish elliptical shapes, redder colors, and lower sSFR.
Identifying the voids from the TNG300-1 simulations via the Void-Finder
algorithm, we explore if and how the shapes of the TNG galaxies located on void
surfaces are aligned with the directions toward the void centers. Noting that
only the giant void-surface galaxies with stellar masses $M_{\star}\ge
10^{10.5}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ exhibit significant tendency of perpendicular
alignments, we dichotomize them into two $M_{\star}$-controlled samples
according to their morphologies (elliptical or spiral), colors (redder or
bluer), sSFR (lower or higher) and stellar ages (older or younger). It is found
that the void-galaxy perpendicular alignment becomes stronger for the cases
that the void-surface galaxies have elliptical shapes, redder colors, and lower
sSFR. The numerical results are also shown to be well described by the
analytical one-parameter model derived under the assumption of the existence of
a linear scaling between the covariance matrices of galaxy shape axes and local
tidal tensors. Our result implies that the compression of adjacent matter due
to the formation and rapid expansion of cosmic voids prevent them from radial
infall/accretion, which in turn contribute to stalling and quenching the giant
void-surface galaxies. Given that the formation epochs and expansion rates of
cosmic voids depend sensitively on the dark energy equation of state, we also
discuss a possibility of using the abundance of elliptical void-surface
galaxies as a probe of dark energy.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of dark matter halo masses for galaxy groups is central
to studies of galaxy evolution and for leveraging group catalogues as
cosmological probes. We present a calibration and evaluation of two
complementary halo mass estimators: a dynamical estimator based on the virial
theorem, and an empirical relation between the sum of the stellar masses of the
three most massive group galaxies and the halo mass (SHMR). Using
state-of-the-art semi-analytic models (SHARK, SAGE, and GAEA) to generate mock
light-cone catalogues, we quantify the accuracy, uncertainty, and model
dependence of each method. The calibrated virial theorem achieves negligible
systematic bias (mean $\Delta$ = -0.01 dex) and low scatter (mean $\sigma$ =
0.20 dex) with no sensitivity to baryonic physics. The calibrated SHMR yields
the highest precision (mean $\Delta$ = 0.02 dex, mean $\sigma$ = 0.14 dex) but
shows greater model dependence due to sensitivity to baryonic physics across
the models. We demonstrate applications to observational catalogues, including
the empirical halo mass function and mapping quenched fractions in the stellar
mass-halo mass plane. We provide guidance: the virial theorem is recommended
for GAMA-like surveys (i < 19.2) at z < 0.1 where minimal model dependence is
required, while the SHMR is optimal for high-precision halo mass estimates
across diverse catalogues with limits of z < 0.3. These calibrated estimators
will aid upcoming wide-area spectroscopic surveys in probing the connection
between galaxies and their host dark matter halos.

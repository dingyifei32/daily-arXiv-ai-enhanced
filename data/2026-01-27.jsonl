We study the system in two physically distinct regimes: the near degenerate low temperature limit, and the high temperature regime. In the low temperature regime, we derive the thermodynamic quantities using the standard Sommerfeld expansion. In the high temperature regime, we evaluate all thermodynamic quantities numerically from the exact grand canonical potential and demonstrate that the thermodynamics of the Fermi gas reduces to the standard relativistic ideal gas behavior. We apply the resulting low temperature equation of state to study compact astrophysical objects, namely, non rotating white dwarfs and neutron stars. Helium white dwarfs exhibit a strong dependence on the deformation scale, while white dwarfs composed of heavier elements are less affected. For neutron stars, the modified equation of state leads to configurations that are smaller in radius and lower in mass than is by nucleonic equations of state. Our results highlight how modified relativity theories can be probed by studying astrophysical objects."}

Thus, single-pulse studies across frequencies can provide crucial insights into the physics of radio emission. Multiple studies have investigated single-pulse correlations in PSR B0329+54 with widely separated discrete frequencies, reporting the broadband nature of pulsar emission. However, understanding the frequency evolution of these correlations has been limited by poor frequency sampling, and the physical origin of these correlations remains unexplored. We present a detailed study of single-pulse correlations in PSR B0329+54 at low radio frequencies using the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), with well-sampled time series spanning 300-1460 MHz. We derived an inverted flux spectrum for this pulsar, with a turnover near 470 MHz. We used flux-calibrated and scintillation-corrected single pulses to study correlations across frequencies. Our results show that maximum correlations consistently occur near the longitude of the central component, with correlation strength exceeding 69\\% for all frequency combinations, while outer components exhibit correlations above 46\\%. These findings indicate very strong inter-frequency correlations, with no anticorrelations detected. No cross-component correlations were observed; only corresponding components correlate across frequencies. The longitudes of maximum correlation do not coincide with the intensity peaks of the average profile. We also examine how correlations vary with frequency at selected fiducial longitudes. The observations reported in this work favor curvature radiation from relativistic charge bunches in the pulsar plasma; however, reproducing the correlation curves along with spectra remains an open challenge."}

These features provide new constraints on supernova (SN) explosion physics and ejecta-circumstellar medium (CSM) interactions. We present high-resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a neutrino-driven SN explosion tailored to Cas A, following the system from core collapse to an age of $\\sim 1000$ yr. The models include key physical processes such as hydrodynamic instabilities, Ni-bubble effects, radiative cooling, non-equilibrium ionization, and electron-ion temperature equilibration. Our results show that the filamentary ejecta network naturally forms during the early explosion due to the interaction of neutrino-driven bubbles and instabilities, retaining a memory of the initial conditions before being progressively modified by the reverse shock. The GM morphology is reproduced by the interaction of dense ejecta clumps with an asymmetric, forward-shocked CSM shell, with radiative cooling enhancing fragmentation and generating the observed holes and rings. Overall, our study demonstrates that Cas A's complex morphology reflects both the imprint of the explosion mechanism and subsequent ejecta-CSM interactions."}

Among competing models, the collapse of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos provide a plausible explanation for early SMBH formation. While previous studies on modeling the gravothermal collapse of SIDM halos have primarily focused on non-relativistic evolution under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, We advance this framework by relaxing the equilibrium assumption and additionally incorporating general-relativistic effects. To this end, we introduce the Misner-Sharp formalism to the SIDM context for the first time. Our model reproduces the standard hydrostatic models in the early long-mean-free-path (LMFP) regime, but displays interesting distinct behavior in the late short-mean-free-path (SMFP) regime, where intense outward heat flux drives a rapid expansion of the outer envelope, removing mass from the core and significantly decelerating the collapse. Our general relativistic treatment enables us to follow halo evolution to the final stage when the apparent horizon forms. Our simulation yields a seed black hole mass of approximately $3\\times10^{-8}$ of the halo mass at horizon formation, suggesting that additional mechanisms such as baryonic effects are critical for seeding black holes that are sufficiently massive to account for SMBHs in the early Universe."}

The X-ray microcalorimeter spectrometer onboard XRISM can measure line shifts with unprecedented precision of $\\sim$0.2 eV, equivalent to a line-of-sight velocity of $\\sim$10 km s$^{-1}$. At this level of accuracy, however, several factors that influence the line energy must be carefully considered prior to astrophysical interpretation. One such important factor is the ionization degree, Fe$^{q+}$. The K$α$ line shifts redward by $\\sim$4 eV as $q$ increases from 0 (neutral) to 8 (Ar-like). Additionally, the accompanying Fe K$β$ line at 7.06 keV shifts blueward by $\\sim$30 eV from $q=0$ to 8. We demonstrate that this effect is actually observable in the XRISM data of the high-mass X-ray binary Centaurus X-3 (Cen X-3). We advocate that the differential energy shift between the K$α$ and K$β$ line provides a robust estimate of $q$ by decoupling from other effects that shift the two lines in the same direction. We derived $q \\sim 5$ (Sc-like) for the fluorescing matter by comparing the observation with atomic structure calculations of our own and in the literature. By accounting for the derived charge state and the corresponding shift in the rest-frame line energy, we made corrections for this effect and reached a consistent residual shift among the K$α$, K$β$, and the optical measurement attributable to the systemic velocity of the system. Consequently, we obtained a new constraint on the location of the cold matter. This ionization effect needs to be assessed in all use cases of the Fe K$α$ line shift beyond Cen X-3, and the proposed metric is generally applicable to all of them."}

Because it interacts only through gravity, one of the most direct probes is weak gravitational lensing: the deflection of light from distant galaxies by intervening mass. Here we present an extremely detailed, wide-area weak-lensing mass map, covering 0.77 deg x 0.70 deg, using high-resolution imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as part of the COSMOS-Web survey. By measuring the shapes of 129 galaxies per square arcminute-many independently in the F115W and F150W bands-we achieve an angular resolution of 1.00 +/- 0.01 arcmin. Our map has more than twice the resolution of earlier Hubble Space Telescope maps, revealing how dark and luminous matter co-evolve across filaments, clusters, and under-densities. It traces mass features out to z ~ 2, including the most distant structure at z ~ 1.1. The sensitivity to high-redshift lensing constrains galaxy environments at the peak of cosmic star formation and sets a high-resolution benchmark for testing theories about the nature of dark matter and the formation of large-scale cosmic structure"}

The latest experimental observations of the PeV total spectrum, composition energy spectrum, and anisotropy-particularly the precise measurements of the proton spectrum by the LHAASO experiment-have provided crucial breakthroughs in uncovering its origin. Based on the latest LHAASO measurements of the proton energy spectrum, combined with cosmic-ray spectral and anisotropy data, this study proposes that the spectral index variation in the knee region arises from changes in the propagation coefficient. By introducing a knee position $\\rm \\mathcal{R}_{knee}$ and an index variation $\\rm δ_{knee}$, we construct a rigidity-dependent double-power-law diffusion model to reproduce the knee-region spectral structure. Through modifications to the diffusion coefficient, we successfully replicate the observed knee-region spectral structure in the LHAASO proton spectrum and calculate the corresponding anisotropy. Under current data and model dependencies, a joint analysis of the energy spectrum and anisotropy does not support the propagation origin model of the cosmic-ray knee at a 95\\% confidence level. We hope that future LHAASO experiments will provide precise measurements of the energy spectra and anisotropies of various nuclei in the knee region, thereby offering a definitive test of the propagation model as the origin mechanism of the knee-region spectral structure."}

While recent studies suggest that magnetic reconnection governs the evolution of such systems, a comprehensive understanding has been lacking. Here we test a reconnection-mediated model for decaying magnetic turbulence in two-dimensional (strict-2D), 2.5D, and three-dimensional (3D) systems with both helical and nonhelical initial conditions. We show that the magnetic-energy decay timescale scales with the Lundquist number in a manner consistent with Sweet-Parker-type reconnection rather than Alfvenic or purely resistive timescales. We develop a broken power-law model for the magnetic energy spectra and provide analytic predictions for the temporal evolution of energy across both sub-inertial and inertial ranges, which are confirmed by high-resolution simulations. In nonhelical turbulence, these results favor anastrophy as the dominant constraint over helicity fluctuations. Using Minkowski functionals to analyze reconnecting current sheets in real space, we find that the structures controlling the decay are substantially smaller than the global magnetic correlation scale, implying local Lundquist numbers well below the system-scale value. This explains the weak sensitivity of global decay laws to current-sheet resolution and that the current-sheet aspect ratios converge toward Sweet-Parker predictions only at sufficiently high resolution. Together, these results establish magnetic reconnection as the organizing principle underlying inverse transfer, spectral evolution, and decay in magnetically dominated turbulence, providing a unified picture applicable across dimensionality and helicity regimes with direct implications for astrophysical plasmas."}

These theories lead to the formation of dense dark matter structures known as minihalos, which provide insights into early Universe dynamics and have implications for direct detection experiments. We examine the mass loss of minihalos during stellar encounters, building on previous studies that derived formulas for mass loss and performed N-body simulations. We propose a new formula for the mass loss that accounts for changes in the minihalo profile after disruption by a passing star. We also investigate the mass loss for multiple stellar encounters. We demonstrate that accurately assessing the mass loss in minihalos due to multiple stellar encounters necessitates considering the alterations in the minihalo's binding energy after each encounter, as overlooking this aspect results in a substantial underestimation of the mass loss.\n  We further extend our analysis to the Galactic environment by more accurately incorporating multiple stellar encounters and dynamical relaxation timescales, simulating minihalo orbits in the Galactic potential. Our results show stellar interactions are more destructive than previously estimated, reducing minihalo mass retention at the solar system to ~30%, compared to earlier estimates of ~60%. This enhanced loss arises from cumulative energy injections when relaxation periods between stellar encounters are accounted for. The altered minihalo mass function implies a larger fraction of axion dark matter occupies inter-minihalo space, potentially increasing the local axion density and improving haloscope detection prospects. This thesis highlights the significance of detailed modeling of stellar disruptions in shaping the axion dark matter distribution."}

We compare the full EFT to several other models: a version neglecting the velocity-shear term, the non-linear alignment model (NLA), and to a reduced EFT assuming co-evolution relations that follow from the assumption that alignment is linear in Lagrangian space. The first two models yield biased constraints on the alignment amplitude, but the reduced EFT performs remarkably well, achieving a low reduced chi-squared and minimal bias. We examine the redshift and mass dependence of the higher-order bias parameters, finding that the linear Lagrangian bias assumption is approximately satisfied across the explored halo mass and redshift ranges for both galaxies and haloes, suggesting that the galaxies broadly follow the alignment properties of their host haloes.

We first construct two neural network models: one trained using only spectral flux values and another trained using both fluxes and their associated errors.

To gain physical interpretability of these networks, we fit all spectra with a simple phenomenological model consisting of a thermal disk component and a power-law. From this analysis, we identify the blackbody temperature, power-law index, the ratio of blackbody to power-law flux, the reduced $χ^2$, and the variance of the data as key parameters that likely contribute to the classification. We validate this inference by designing an additional neural network trained exclusively on this reduced parameter set, without using the spectral data directly. This parameter-based model achieves a classification accuracy comparable to that of the spectral models. Our results show that deep neural networks can not only classify compact objects in X-ray binaries with high accuracy but can also be interpreted in terms of physically meaningful spectral parameters derived from conventional X-ray spectral analysis. This framework offers a promising, mission-agnostic approach for compact object classification in current and future X-ray surveys."}

If the horizon entanglement entropy falls slightly below the Bekenstein-Hawking value, we parametrize the shortfall by a fractional deficit $δ(a)$ evolving with the FLRW scale factor $a$. The associated equipartition deficit at the Gibbons-Hawking temperature then sources a smooth, homogeneous component whose density scales as $H^{2}/G$, with a dimensionless coefficient $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ of order unity times $δ(a)$. Because this component tracks $H^{2}$, it is negligible at early times but can activate at redshifts $z\\lesssim 1$, raising the late time expansion rate by a few percent without affecting recombination or the sound horizon. We present a minimal three parameter activation model for $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ and derive its impact on the background expansion, effective equation of state, and linear growth for a smooth entanglement sector. The framework predicts a small boost in $H(z)$, a mild suppression of $fσ_{8}(z)$, and a corresponding modification of the low-$z$ distance-redshift relation. We test these predictions against current low-redshift data sets, including SN~Ia distance moduli, baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements, cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, and redshift space distortion constraints, and discuss whether the $H_0$ tension can be consistently interpreted as a late-time, horizon-scale information deficit rather than an early universe modification."}

Here we present observational evidence that galaxy filaments connecting pairs of galaxy clusters undergo a split infall, with opposite velocity flows toward the two clusters. Using spectroscopic galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we isolate the internal filament velocity field by subtracting its rigid-body background motion and Hubble flow, and detect this effect at greater than $5σ$ significance across a wide range of cluster and filament selections. The measured velocity profile exhibits a sign reversal near the filament midpoint and a maximum infall amplitude of $\\sim30$ km/s ($\\sim20$ km/s projected onto the line-of-sight) for clusters of mass $\\sim10^{14.3}M_\\odot$, substantially lower than expected for infall from an average cosmic environment.

Two of those resolutions are also run with a weaker central magnetic field of $\\mathord{\\approx}10^{10}\\, \\mathrm{G}$ . The shock revival time for all models is largely independent of resolution and initial magnetic field strength, but we find higher explosion energies when the initial magnetism is stronger and at higher resolutions. We find that models with strong magnetic fields have lower neutrino luminosity and energies, due to a proto-neutron star (PNS) that is deformed by the strong magnetic fields. At higher resolutions, magnetic fields are amplified more efficiently in the gain region and in the PNS via the small-scale dynamo. Although the strong magnetic fields do not directly drive the explosion, they have a subsidiary impact on the explosion mechanism and compensate for the reduced neutrino heating. Stronger magnetic energies in the PNS also affect energy and angular momentum redistribution, leading to more extended and vigorous PNS convection zones at higher resolutions."}

Despite several observed excesses in the distribution of arrival directions for the highest energy cosmic rays, the sources remain unidentified. Accretion shocks in galaxy clusters have been proposed as potential sources in the past. These immense shock waves, which can have radii on the order of megaparsecs, are generated by the infall of material from the intergalactic medium into the gravitational potential wells of galaxy clusters. In this work, we investigate the possibility that ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays are accelerated in these regions. Nearby massive galaxy clusters, including Virgo, are treated as a discrete component of the cluster mass distribution. Less massive galaxy clusters, as well as distant massive ones, are assumed to follow a continuous distribution in agreement with cluster mass statistics. We fit the flux at Earth and the composition profile measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory, assuming the injection of different nuclear species by these sources, to determine the values of the model parameters. Our results indicate that cosmic ray acceleration in cluster accretion shocks may account for at least a fraction of the observed UHECR flux at energies below the suppression scale. At higher energies, direct acceleration from the thermal pool would be feasible only if local fluctuations create favorable conditions, such as magnetic fields about an order of magnitude stronger than those typically expected in cluster accretion shocks, or for particular shock normal-magnetic field configurations."}

The hydrostatic mass and the mass obtained from gravitational lensing measurements generally differ, a discrepancy known as the hydrostatic mass bias. In this work, we derive the hydrostatic mass of galaxy clusters within the framework of Rastall gravity and investigate its implications under two scenarios: (i) the absence of dark matter and (ii) the existence of dark matter. In the first scenario, Rastall gravity effectively reduces the hydrostatic mass, bringing it closer to the observed baryonic mass. The best linear fit yields a slope $\\mathbf{M}=1.07\\pm0.11$, indicating a near one-to-one correspondence between the two masses. In the second scenario, Rastall gravity helps to alleviate the hydrostatic mass bias. The linear fit between the Rastall hydrostatic mass and the observed lensing mass results in a best-fit slope $\\mathbf{M}=1.01\\pm0.16$, which is very close to unity.

While effective for simple models and speedy spectral fitting, these local optimizers are prone to becoming trapped in local minima, particularly in high-dimensional or degenerate parameter spaces, and typically require extensive user intervention. In this work, we introduce XFit, a global optimization method for fitting X-ray data, which makes extensive use of the Ferret evolutionary algorithm. XFit enables automated exploration of complex parameter spaces, efficient mapping of confidence intervals, and identification of degenerate solutions that may be overlooked by local methods. We demonstrate the performance of XFit using two representative X-ray sources: the Central Compact Object in Cassiopeia A and the supernova remnant G41.1-0.3. These examples span both low- and high-dimensional models, allowing us to illustrate the advantages of global optimization. In both cases, XFit produces solutions that are consistent with or improve upon those found with traditional methods, while also revealing alternative fits or degenerate solutions within statistically acceptable confidence levels. The automated mapping of parameter space offered by XFit makes it a powerful complement to existing spectral fitting tools, particularly as models and data quality become increasingly complex. Future work will expand the application of XFit to broader datasets and more physically motivated models."}

By introducing a principle of isonomy - ensuring identical particle species dependence for Hawking emission and absorption - we find that, whenever the temperature of the PBH environment is larger than the PBH horizon temperature, PBHs generically gain mass. In particular, for PBH masses following the critical collapse mass-scaling law with critical exponent $γ_\\mathrm{crit}$, with $γ_\\mathrm{crit} \\in (0.33, 0.49)$, the aforementioned radiative absorption mass growth mechanism produces a striking effect: PBHs forming with a mass $10^6M_\\odot$ during BBN can reach $\\mathcal{O}(10^{10} M_\\odot)$ within $\\mathcal{O}(10^{6} \\mathrm{s})$ ($\\sim $ 58 days).

The Schwarzschild treatment presented here can be extended to spherically symmetric cosmological black holes, indicating that radiative absorption is a dominant and previously overlooked PBH growth channel in the early Universe."}

Using follow-up high-resolution VLBI observations and archival data, we investigate the morphology and the variations in orientation and core flux density of the 3C 66A jet to gain a deeper insights into its kinematic behavior and physical origins. We performed KVN and VERA array (KaVA) observations at 22/43 GHz over three epochs in 2014 and collected 109 sets of Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) archival data at 43 GHz between 1996 - 2025. We imaged the parsec-scale jet and parameterized it using circular Gaussian fittings to the UV visibilities. Finally, we derived the inner jet PA and the core flux densities for the VLBA data. The jet presents a twisted morphology in the KaVA maps. The PA of the fitted Gaussian components is in the range between 170 deg and 195 deg. Our kinematic analysis using the VLBA data indicates that the PA oscillates with an amplitude of 7.77 pm 0.79 deg and a period of 10.94 pm 0.22 years, presented for the first time in this work. This oscillation is topped by a continuous clockwise shift of the PA by -0.83 pm 0.07 deg/year. We also identified a strong core flux variability with possible periodicity and a 2 sigma correlation between the core flux density and the inner jet PA change. We discuss possible physical models that could explain the observed features for this object; in particular, a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) system, Lense Thirring (LT) effect, and jet or disk instabilities. The oscillation and continuous shift of the PA and the possible radio flux periodicity, together with the optical flux periodicity of approximately 2 years that had previously been confirmed in several independent studies, favor a jet precession scenario driven by orbital motion and disk-orbit misalignment in a SMBHB system."}

By applying the halo mass function and halo bias, we convolve contributions from individual halos across a range of masses and redshifts to derive the large-scale structure contribution to the DM PDF. We validate our analytical predictions against consistency-check simulations and compare them with the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation across a range of redshifts up to $z = 5$, demonstrating excellent agreement. We demonstrate that our model produces consistent results when fitting gas profiles and predicting the PDF, and vice versa. We show that the BFC parameters controlling the gas profile, particularly the halo mass scale ($M_\\mathrm{c}$), mass-dependent slope ($μ$), and outer truncation ($δ$), are the primary drivers of the PDF shape. Additionally, we investigate the validity of the log-normal approximation commonly used for DM distributions, finding that it provides a sufficient description for a few hundred FRBs.

Comments welcome", "summary": "Bow-shock pulsar wind nebulae are valuable sources to investigate the dynamics of relativistic pulsar winds and the mechanisms by which they are converted into cosmic-ray leptons at the highest energies. The Lighthouse Nebula is one such object, famous for the high velocity of its pulsar and a long misaligned X-ray jet that is understood as a specific escape channel for the most energetic particles. We aim to get a better understanding of how the bulk of non-thermal particles are released into the interstellar medium. We focus on GHz radio observations, which probe lower-energy particles that are dominant in number and long-lived, thus offering a picture of how escape proceeds in the long run. We analyze 10.5h of MeerKAT observations in the 0.9-1.7GHz band. MeerKAT observations reveal a highly structured synchrotron nebula downstream of pulsar PSR J1101-6101. A cometary tail is detected up to beyond 5pc from the pulsar, while a system of multiple transverse two-sided emission streaks is observed for the first time. No radio counterpart of the misaligned X-ray jet is seen. The radio streaks are interpreted as the occasional charge-independent release of energetic leptons from the tail into the surrounding medium, as a result of dynamical instabilities and reconfiguration in the downstream flow. The intensity layout suggests that most of the particle content of the nebula is discharged into the ambient medium within several parsec. Once escaped, particles light up the ambient magnetic field, which appears to have a coherence length of at least a few parsec. The length and persistence of the streaks indicate a low level of magnetic turbulence, possibly slightly enhanced with respect to average cosmic-ray transport conditions in the Galaxy. Such a confinement may result from self-generated turbulence by resonant streaming instability, or be due to past activity of the progenitor star."}

This dramatic spectral change also affects the expected properties of thermal and radiatively powered winds, matching the overall properties of winds seen in new XRISM data from the stellar mass binaries, though there can also be additional UV and dust driven winds in supermassive black holes. The radio data in stellar and supermassive black holes are clear that the hot flow (not the disc) connects to the radio jet, and the radio-X-ray 'fundamental plane' can be qualitatively understood if the radio quiet AGN and stellar mass black holes have low to moderate spins, with the jet power set as a constant fraction of the accretion power. A small fraction of AGN (radio loud) instead have much higher (factor $100-1000\\times$) radio-to-X-ray ratio at the same black hole mass and mass accretion rates. I speculate that these have higher jet power due to high black hole spin.

Interaction with the turbulent background plasma is key to the acceleration of many types of energetic particles including high-energy cosmic rays, solar energetic particles, and pick-up ions. This is a process that would ideally be described by a kinetic model, a type of model that follows a probability distribution function (PDF) for all particles in 7-dimensional space. Because of the high dimensionality of a kinetic model, such simulations use the largest computational resources available, and are yet unable to simulate a realistic number of particles, reach the large scales necessary for astrophysical problems, or use high-precision numerical methods. Two available alternatives to kinetic plasma models have been explored: a multi-fluid model, and a hybrid fluid/Fokker-Planck model. These methods are hampered by the physical modeling of the coupling. We develop a new model, which follows the PDF for all particles; this can be viewed as a step toward physical realism above a multi-fluid MHD model, while also being more computationally efficient than a kinetic model. The equations we develop model both the background plasma and the energetic particles self-consistently. Over the last decade, similar PDF methods have been developed to a high level of sophistication to model reactive flows and turbulent combustion for engineering applications. For treatment of the feedback of the energetic particles on a background plasma, a PDF closure approach should evaluate the mean characteristics, including the density, with better statistical quality than will particle-sampling procedures."}

One proposed mechanism is rotochemical heating, in which the continuous contraction of the neutron star due to its spin-down produces chemical imbalances that induce Urca reactions, and the latter deposit heat in the neutron star core. If the protons in the star are superconducting, their energy gap suppresses the reactions, except in microscopic magnetized regions (such as quantized flux tubes) in which the protons act as if they were normal. Therefore, the strength of the internal magnetic field controls the rate at which reactions proceed and thus affects the thermal evolution of the neutron star. Here, we present the first comprehensive study of the effect of an internal magnetic field in the superconducting interior on rotochemical heating. We simulate the evolution of neutron stars for different internal magnetic field strengths and neutron energy gaps, comparing the results to Hubble Space Telescope observations of old neutron stars. All the observational data can be accounted for if the proton energy gap is large ($\\sim 1.5\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$) and the neutron energy gap is small ($\\lesssim 0.1\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$) or vanishing, while the millisecond pulsar PSR~J0437$-$4715 needs to have a very weak internal magnetic field.

Using the latest stringent limits on PMF, we show the numerical results of ALP-photon oscillation probability distributions with the homogeneous and stochastic magnetic field scenarios. The PBH-induced stochastic ALP-photon oscillations in the PMF may have the effects on some further phenomena, such as the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the cosmic X-ray background (CXB), and the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB)."}

Among competing models, the collapse of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos provide a plausible explanation for early SMBH formation. While previous studies on modeling the gravothermal collapse of SIDM halos have primarily focused on non-relativistic evolution under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, We advance this framework by relaxing the equilibrium assumption and additionally incorporating general-relativistic effects. To this end, we introduce the Misner-Sharp formalism to the SIDM context for the first time. Our model reproduces the standard hydrostatic models in the early long-mean-free-path (LMFP) regime, but displays interesting distinct behavior in the late short-mean-free-path (SMFP) regime, where intense outward heat flux drives a rapid expansion of the outer envelope, removing mass from the core and significantly decelerating the collapse. Our general relativistic treatment enables us to follow halo evolution to the final stage when the apparent horizon forms. Our simulation yields a seed black hole mass of approximately $3\\times10^{-8}$ of the halo mass at horizon formation, suggesting that additional mechanisms such as baryonic effects are critical for seeding black holes that are sufficiently massive to account for SMBHs in the early Universe."}

BFC provides a computationally efficient alternative to expensive hydrodynamical simulations for modelling baryonic effects on cosmological scales. By applying the halo mass function and halo bias, we convolve contributions from individual halos across a range of masses and redshifts to derive the large-scale structure contribution to the DM PDF. We validate our analytical predictions against consistency-check simulations and compare them with the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation across a range of redshifts up to $z = 5$, demonstrating excellent agreement. We demonstrate that our model produces consistent results when fitting gas profiles and predicting the PDF, and vice versa. We show that the BFC parameters controlling the gas profile, particularly the halo mass scale ($M_\\mathrm{c}$), mass-dependent slope ($μ$), and outer truncation ($δ$), are the primary drivers of the PDF shape. Additionally, we investigate the validity of the log-normal approximation commonly used for DM distributions, finding that it provides a sufficient description for a few hundred FRBs. Our work provides a self-consistent model that links gas density profiles to integrated DM statistics, enabling future constraints on baryonic feedback processes from FRB observations."}

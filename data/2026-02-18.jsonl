ABCMB has sub-percent-level agreement with CLASS and can be run on a GPU with competitive, and sometimes even faster, run times. It is refactored compared to previous codes and takes advantage of object-oriented programming to improve extensibility, meaning new physics can be added to it without the need for modifying source files.

With the aim to generate synthetic empirical data for fine-tuning LSS classification algorithms, as well as to train machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL) models for the same purpose, this work presents a purely geometrical simulation based on statistical spatial properties found in LSS surveys, using the spectroscopic main galaxy sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) catalogue up to a redshift of z~0.1 as a specific use case. A parallelism between the LSS and the Voronoi tessellation was utilised, in which the nodes, links, surfaces, and cells of the diagram correspond to clusters, filaments, walls, and voids, respectively. The simulation used random positions within voids as seeds for tessellating the 3D space. The resulting structures were randomly populated with galaxies that adhere to the statistical properties of their observational respective structures. As the galaxies were generated, they were tagged with their corresponding structure. In each simulation, six LSS mock catalogues were generated, following the statistical behaviour observed in the SDSS catalogue, depending on the structure they belong to. The Malmquist bias and the Fingers of God effect were simulated as well. We present a novel geometrical LSS simulator, where generated galaxies mimic the statistical properties of their observational belonging structure. The simulator was tuned to mimic the SDSS catalogue, although any other catalogue can be considered. With the generated catalogue, it is possible to adjust the LSS classification algorithms, train and test ML/DL models, and benchmark several LSS classification methods using this pre-labelled data to contrast their results and performance."}

To this end, we focus on the class of $f(R,T)$ models defined by $f(R,T)=R+F(T)$, which provide a simple yet theoretically consistent realization of nonminimal matter-gravity interactions and can be reformulated as general relativity minimally coupled to a modified matter Lagrangian. Using nonstandard global monopole solutions as a toy model for realistic particles, we show that the spatial average of $F$ typically differs significantly from $F$ evaluated at the spatially averaged trace of $T$, implying that homogeneous cosmological models generally fail to capture the correct large-scale dynamics of the Universe. We further show that dust in these theories generally exhibits a non-vanishing proper pressure. Our results underscore the necessity of properly accounting for spatial averaging when modeling cosmology in theories with nonminimal matter-gravity couplings."}

We capture the time-sliced near-zone magnetospheric geometry relevant for axion--photon mixing. Plasma effects are incorporated through an effective Goldreich--Julian charge density, used to determine the effective plasma frequency and the location of resonant conversion surfaces. Our results show that axion--photon resonant conversion in binary magnetospheres mostly occurs on extended peanut-shaped surfaces whose global geometry evolves as the binary inspiral evolves. As a consequence, the total electromagnetic power emitted through axion--photon conversion exhibits a characteristic dependence on axion mass and a slow temporal modulation correlated with the gravitational wave frequency emission. This feature is potentially detectable for $m_a \\in [50,170] \\,\\rm μeV$ and set $g_{a γ} \\lesssim 10^{-11}\\rm \\,GeV^{-1}$ as it lies within the sensitivity limits of current or planned radio observation missions.

In this study, we investigate how deviations from the standard nearly-scale-free primordial power spectrum impact observables for the fully compact, orientable Euclidean topologies ($E_1$--$E_6$). We examine how such deviations modify the detectability of the underlying topology, depending on whether they are an intrinsic consequence of non-trivial topology or independent of it. We compute CMB temperature correlation matrices across a range of topologies, fundamental domain sizes, and observer locations for both standard and modified primordial power spectra. The impact of these modifications on the detectability of topology is quantified using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, providing an estimate of the distinguishability of non-trivial and simply-connected topologies based solely on CMB temperature observations. In addition, we employ the CatBoost machine learning algorithm to classify harmonic-space realizations of CMB temperature maps and thereby assess the observational prospects for topology detection. Signatures of non-trivial topology are encoded in the off-diagonal structure of the CMB temperature correlation matrices and are most prominent on the largest angular scales. Deviations from the simple power-law primordial spectrum at these scales can substantially alter the detectability of topology, either enhancing its characteristic CMB imprints or suppressing them below observational sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that uncertainties in the primordial power spectrum must be carefully accounted for in robust searches for cosmic topology using the CMB."}

Recent models of TDE disks show that they undergo brief thermal instabilities with temporal super-Eddington accretion at late times, which has been suggested as a possibility to explain the ubiquitous late radio emergence in TDEs. We model the ultraviolet (UV) and optical signatures of such disk instabilities, expected from the accretion power being reprocessed by the optically-thick outflow following super-Eddington accretion. Our model predicts brief UV-bright transients lasting for days, with luminosities of $10^{42}$-$10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in near-UV and $10^{41}$-$10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in optical for a typical TDE by a $10^6~M_\\odot$ black hole.

The quasar (QSO) number densities are a powerful probe for understanding the effects of intervening material. Absorption lines in QSO spectra reveal the presence of interstellar and intergalactic gas, which can change observed fluxes through dust extinction and plasma lensing. By combining observations from radio (VLASS), infrared (WISE), and optical bands (DESI), we assembled a sample of QSOs: ~4000 sources with MgII absorbers, and ~12, 000 non-absorbers. In the radio band, the MgII sample shows a moderate excess at the bright end of the flux distribution, which is broadly consistent with plasma lensing predications. In the optical, the MgII sample turns over at higher g-band fluxes and exhibits a steeper decline at the faint end than the non-MgII sample. Control samples were constructed by matching in redshift, infrared (W1), and optical (g) luminosities. In these comparisons, the radio excess becomes less prominent, suggesting that the apparent magnification may not be robust evidence for plasma lensing. Nevertheless, a weak contribution cannot be ruled out, especially given residual excess observed at the bright end relative to the non-MgII sample. Dust extinction along the line-of-sight remains a plausible alternative. Regardless of the dominant mechanism, the multi-wavelength differences offer a valuable probe of the physical state of the intervening medium."}

We use orbital chirp data to infer distances to 21 MSPs; and for four of which we obtain smaller uncertainties than those reported in previous distance measurements.

The method exploits analytic structure in the relevant Wigner-3j symbol configurations appearing in temperature and polarization coupling matrices, expressing all required quantities in terms of a small set of recurrence-generated values which are precomputed and stored in lookup tables. This approach reduces the computational cost of constructing the full coupling matrices whilst maintaining numerical accuracy.\n  We demonstrate the performance of the threej_cosmo implementation using realistic survey masks from current CMB experiments. Relative to standard recursion-based approaches used in existing pseudo-C_l pipelines, the method achieves speedups of 6-25x in practical coupling-matrix constructions, with the largest gains occurring at high multipoles. The algorithm admits efficient parallelisation on both CPUs and GPUs, the latter providing additional acceleration, up to a further order of 50 on modern hardware, without altering the underlying formalism.\n  Beyond full matrix construction, the approach is naturally suited to applications in which only a restricted set of l3 modes is required for each (l1,l2) pair, such as in the computation of band-limited coupling matrices and analytic covariance terms. These features make threej_cosmo a practical backend for pseudo-C_l estimation and related calculations in next-generation CMB analysis pipelines."}

This is particularly true for g-modes, whose frequency and tidal coupling are highly sensitive to the composition of NSs, especially in their centers, where microphysical models are the least reliable. However, due to their weak coupling to external tidal fields, their effect on the gravitational-wave (GW) signal of binary inspirals can be difficult to observe. Here we show that the detectability of these tides can be significantly enhanced by binary NSs with moderate eccentricities. This is primarily due to higher eccentric harmonics in the early phase of the binary evolution experiencing larger phase shifts, which they transport to the sensitive band of GW detectors. In addition, g-mode tides in eccentric binaries undergo several epicyclic resonances, which also amplify the total phase shift. We demonstrate that these effects increase the detectability of g-mode dynamical tides by more than an order of magnitude for eccentricities of $e_\\mathrm{10Hz}\\sim0.2-0.4$, making it possible to put robust constraints on g-mode properties using current GW detectors, while all relevant models could potentially be constrained with eccentric binary NSs with Einstein Telescope."}

The supernova remnant (SNR) G292.0+1.8 is one of only three known oxygen-rich SNRs in the galaxy-remnants of core-collapse for which relatively pure fragments of ejecta can be seen. Several dozen ejecta knots from G292.0+1.8 were the subject of a proper motion analysis, based on [O III] 5007-Angstrom images taken over a 22-year baseline by Winkler et al. 2009 (arXiv:0810.1935). They determined that the transverse velocities of the filaments are linearly proportional to their distances from a common expansion center, thus the O-rich filaments have been traveling with little deceleration since the initial supernova event,about 3000 years ago. In this paper, we use optical spectra of G292.0+1.8, all taken from the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO), to measure radial velocities for 93 knots. Assuming un-decelerated expansion, as indi- cated by the proper motions, the radial velocity should be proportional to the distance from the center along the line of sight, just as the proper motions are proportional to the transverse distance. Therefore, we can map the three-dimensional structure and kinematics of the SNR. We find that the knots generally follow a broad bi-conical distribution, suggesting that the supernova explosion produced broad jets of ejecta. This structure is similar to that seen in some other young core-collapse supernova remnants."}

To be submitted to JCAP. Comments are welcome!", "summary": "21cm radiation from neutral hydrogen serves as a direct probe of the Epoch of Reionization. However, both its detection and physical interpretation are severely hindered by contamination from astrophysical foreground emission and instrumental noise that are several orders of magnitude brighter than the signal of interest. A promising way to tackle these challenges is to cross-correlate the 21cm signal with other independent tracers of large-scale structure, most notably high-redshift galaxies. Besides validating putative 21cm detections, such joint analyses are expected to provide independent insights into the properties of ionizing sources and the evolving morphology of ionized regions during reionization. The 21cm signal, however, is intrinsically highly non-Gaussian, limiting the effectiveness of conventional two-point cross-correlation statistics, which capture information only up to the second order. In this work, we therefore investigate the utility of k-nearest-neighbour cumulative distribution functions (kNN CDF), which encode information from the joint clustering at all orders, as an alternative framework for probing 21cm-galaxy cross-correlations. Using self-consistently simulated mock 21cm fields and a catalog of line-emitting galaxies at z = 7, we conducted a proof-of-concept study comparing the kNN CDF formalism and the two-point cross-correlation approach. We find that the kNN CDF statistics outperform the two-point statistics in detecting 21cm-galaxy cross-correlations, even in the presence of instrumental noise and aggressive foreground filtering. Moreover, at a fixed global ionized fraction, it is even able to differentiate between reionization models that remain indistinguishable using two-point statistics.

Veres", "Julia Becker Tjus"], "title": "Bayesian parameter study of the Seyfert-starburst composite galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 7469", "comment": null, "summary": "Multimessenger observation of the Seyfert-starburst composite galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 7469 indicate a characteristic feature in the radio band (the so-called mm-bump) as well as indication of high-energy neutrinos by the AGN corona. Moreover, also the starburst ring of these sources is bright in the radio and hence, a potential source of $γ$-rays and neutrinos.\n  We aim to explain the non-thermal features of these two sources with our homogeneous steady-state Seyfert-starburst composite model, which we refined in this work. Hereby, we account for stochastic diffuse acceleration and energy losses within the corona and $γγ$-pair attenuation of the escaping $γ$-rays. Since the non-thermal features of Seyfert sources contribute only marginally to the electromagnetic spectrum, only few data points can be assigned to the starburst ring or the AGN corona. Hence, prior information on the physical parameters is incorporated within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to avoid overfitting.\n  Based on this Bayesian parameter study we show, that the non-thermal features of NGC 1068 can be explained well. Still a more detailed treatment of the spatial inhomogeneities in the central region of the AGN could further improve the fit results. This manifests itself even more clearly in the case of NGC 7469, where the mm-bump needs to emerge from a coronal size $R_{\\rm c}>100\\,\\mathcal{R}_{\\rm s}$, whereas (TeV-PeV)-neutrino emission requires $R_{\\rm c}< 10\\,\\mathcal{R}_{\\rm s}$. Similar to what has previously been shown in other wavebands, our analysis highlights that the spatial extension of the so-called AGN corona depends the considered energy of the messenger. Hence, it seems that there is not a unique edge of the corona and a substantial progress in the understanding of these phenomena is expected if future analysis account for these spatial inhomogeneities."}

Orbital chirp has contributions from intrinsic energy loss due to gravitational wave emission, kinematic effects due to motion in the plane of the sky, and dynamical effects due to galactic acceleration, with the latter two contributions depending on the MSP distance. We use orbital chirp data to infer distances to 21 MSPs; and for four of which we obtain smaller uncertainties than those reported in previous distance measurements. We incorporate multiple realistic galactic acceleration models to assess the sensitivity of the inferred distances to the choice of galactic gravitational potential, finding a significant dependence for four MSPs."}

The quasar (QSO) number densities are a powerful probe for understanding the effects of intervening material. Absorption lines in QSO spectra reveal the presence of interstellar and intergalactic gas, which can change observed fluxes through dust extinction and plasma lensing. By combining observations from radio (VLASS), infrared (WISE), and optical bands (DESI), we assembled a sample of QSOs: ~4000 sources with MgII absorbers, and ~12, 000 non-absorbers. In the radio band, the MgII sample shows a moderate excess at the bright end of the flux distribution, which is broadly consistent with plasma lensing predications. In the optical, the MgII sample turns over at higher g-band fluxes and exhibits a steeper decline at the faint end than the non-MgII sample. Control samples were constructed by matching in redshift, infrared (W1), and optical (g) luminosities. In these comparisons, the radio excess becomes less prominent, suggesting that the apparent magnification may not be robust evidence for plasma lensing. Nevertheless, a weak contribution cannot be ruled out, especially given residual excess observed at the bright end relative to the non-MgII sample. Dust extinction along the line-of-sight remains a plausible alternative. Regardless of the dominant mechanism, the multi-wavelength differences offer a valuable probe of the physical state of the intervening medium."}

As a result, a\ncluster sample selected by richness has a mean lensing signal higher than\nexpected from its mean mass, and the inferred mass will be biased high. This\nselection bias is currently limiting the accuracy of cosmological parameters\nderived from optical clusters. In this paper, we quantify the bias in mass\ncalibration due to this selection bias. Using two simulations, MiniUchuu and\nCardinal, with different galaxy models and cluster finders, we find that the\nselection bias leads to an overestimation of lensing mass at a 20-50% level,\nwith a larger bias 20-80% for large-scale lensing (>3 Mpc). Even with a\nconservative projection model, the impact of selection bias significantly\noutweighs the impact of other currently known cluster lensing systematics. We\nurge the cluster community to account for this bias in all future optical\ncluster cosmology analyses, and we discuss strategies for mitigating this bias."}

While\nprobing the HI gas over cosmic time has improved our understanding, direct HI\ndetection is essentially limited to $z \\lesssim 0.42$ due to the faintness of\nthe 21cm line. Detections beyond this redshift have made use of the stacking\ntechnique to obtain average quantities of galaxy populations. Gravitational\nlensing by the cluster lenses enhances the HI signal and can extend the\nredshift limit further. In this work, we describe simulations of HI lensing in\ncluster lenses. We explore the feasibility of detecting strongly lensed HI\nemission from background galaxies using known 50 cluster lenses within the\nuGMRT sky coverage. We demonstrate that certain clusters offer a strong\nlikelihood of HI detection. We also investigate how strong lensing distorts the\nHI spectral line profile. The shape of the HI signal in these lensing models\nprovides useful information and can be used in optimising signal extraction in\nblind and targeted HI surveys. We find that blind detection of HI signal from\ngalaxies in the redshift range up to 1.58 requires more than a few hundred\nhours of observations of individual clusters with the uGMRT. Detection of HI\nemission in galaxies where strong lensing has been observed in the optical\nappears to be more promising with potential for a $5\\sigma$ detection in $<50$\nhours of on-source observations for Abell 370 and in $<75$ hours for Abell 1703\nwith the uGMRT."}

Various\nsimulations are being developed and used to predict and understand the nature\nand morphology of this signal.

CosmoUiT\nuses the multi-head self-attention mechanism of the transformer to capture the\nlong-range dependencies and convolutional layers in the UNet to capture the\nsmall-scale variations in the target 21-cm field. Furthermore, the training of\nthe emulator is conditioned on the input reionization parameters such that it\ngives a fast and accurate prediction of the 21-cm field for different sets of\ninput reionization parameters. We evaluate the predictions of our emulator by\ncomparing various statistics (e.g., bubble size distribution, power spectrum)\nand morphological features of the emulated and simulated maps.

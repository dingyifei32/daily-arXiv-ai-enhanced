Existing methods, such as continuum fitting, X-ray\nreflection spectroscopy, and quasi-periodic oscillation analysis, suffer from\nlimitations in accuracy, interpretability, and scalability. In this work, a\nhybrid approach is proposed in which theoretical models based on the Teukolsky\nformalism are integrated with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). A PINN\nmodel is developed to solve the linearized spin problem in the scalar case,\nwith physical constraints directly embedded into the training process.\nAnnotated data are not required; instead, the model is trained using the\ndifferential operator and boundary conditions as supervision. It is\ndemonstrated that the PINN converges reliably, with residual loss values below\n10 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) on the order of $10^{-7}$. Benchmarking\nresults indicate that the proposed method outperforms both classical and\ndata-driven machine learning approaches in terms of AUC and sensitivity, while\nalso exhibiting superior interpretability, generalizability, and adherence to\nphysical principles, with moderate computational cost. Potential extensions\ninclude integration with general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD)\nsolvers and application to real observational data. These findings support the\nviability of physics-based machine learning as a robust framework for accurate\nand interpretable black hole spin estimation."}

The standard approach to\nretrieving the 21-cm signal from radio interferometric data separates it from\nbright astrophysical foregrounds by exploiting their spectrally smooth nature,\nin contrast to the finer spectral structure of the 21-cm signal. Contaminants\nexhibiting rapid frequency fluctuations, on the other hand, are difficult to\nseparate from the 21-cm signal using standard techniques, and the power from\nthese contaminants contributes to low-level systematics that can limit our\nability to detect the 21-cm signal. Many of these low-level systematics are\nincoherent across multiple nights of observation, resulting in an incoherent\nexcess variance above the thermal noise sensitivity of the instrument. In this\npaper, we develop a method called cross-GPR (cross covariance Gaussian process\nregression) that exploits the incoherence of these systematics to separate them\nfrom the 21-cm signal, which remains coherent across multiple nights of\nobservation.

We focus on the\nupcoming low-mode survey of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA-Low) telescope.\nUsing CNNs, we analyze simulated 3D 21-cm differential brightness temperature\nmaps generated via the DM21cm code, which is based on 21cmFAST and DarkHistory,\nto distinguish between spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous energy\ninjection/deposition scenarios arising from dark matter annihilation. The\ninhomogeneous case accounts for local dark matter density contrasts and gas\nproperties, such as thermal and ionization states, while the homogeneous model\nassumes uniform energy deposition. Our study focuses on two primary\nannihilation channels to electron-positron pairs ($e^+e^-$) and photons (\n$\\gamma \\gamma$), exploring dark matter masses from 1 MeV to 100 MeV and a\nrange of annihilation cross-sections. For $\\gamma \\gamma$ channel, the\ndistinction across dark matter models is less pronounced due to the larger mean\nfree path of the emitted photons, resulting in a more uniform energy\ndeposition. For $e^+e^-$ channel, the results indicate that the CNNs can\neffectively differentiate between the inhomogeneous and homogeneous cases.\nDespite observational challenges, the results demonstrate that these effects\nremain detectable even after incorporating noise from next-generation radio\ninterferometers, such as the SKA. We find that the inhomogeneous dark matter\nannihilation models can leave measurable imprints on the 21-cm signal maps\ndistinguishable from the homogeneous scenarios for the dark matter masses\n$m_{\\rm DM}=1$ MeV and the annihilation cross-sections of $\\geq 5 \\times\n10^{-30}~{\\rm cm^3/sec}$ ($\\geq 5 \\times 10^{-29}~{\\rm cm^3/sec}$ for $m_{\\rm\nDM}=100$ MeV) for moderate SKA-Low noise."}

While past search efforts have focused on particular source\nclasses-such as fast radio bursts (FRBs) and gamma-ray burst spikes-no\nsystematic, multi-wavelength survey has compared their relative potential for\nPBH discovery. We present here a broad assessment of transient lensing search\nopportunities, spanning more than twenty decades in photon frequency and over\ntwelve orders of magnitude in PBH mass. For each class, we determine the\naccessible PBH mass window by accounting for wave-optics suppression and\ntime-delay resolution limits, and we estimate potential sensitivities to the\nPBH abundance using representative event rates, distances, and optical depths.\nOur survey includes low-frequency radio events (FRBs, pulsar giant pulses,\nplanetary cyclotron bursts), optical/infrared signals, and high-energy\nphenomena (gamma-ray burst spikes, fast X-ray transients, TeV blazar flares).\nWe synthesize these results in a unified mass-abundance diagram and\ncomprehensive tables summarizing both physical reach and observational\nrequirements. This work serves as a roadmap for optimizing future\nmulti-wavelength lensing searches, guiding the design of instruments and\nstrategies to explore the PBH dark matter hypothesis across its remaining\nviable parameter space."}

We present a time-dependent numerical\nframework that self-consistently couples proton acceleration -- modeled by the\nFokker-Planck equation -- with leptonic-hadronic radiation. For the\nneutrino-emitting Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, we reproduce the neutrino spectrum\nobserved by IceCube, while satisfying gamma-ray constraints. We also consider a\ntransient corona scenario, potentially emerging in non-jetted tidal disruption\nevents like AT 2019dsg, and show that early-stage cascade feedback can impact\nproton acceleration and radiation processes in weaker coronae, producing\ndelayed optical/ultraviolet, X-ray, and neutrino emissions of $\\mathcal\nO(100~\\rm d)$. This flexible code efficiently models multi-messenger signals\nfrom both steady and transient astrophysical sources, providing insights in\ncombining particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms."}

The first arises soon after the optical\npeak, reaching a maximum $\\sim1$ year post-discovery before fading. The second\nflare appears $\\sim800$ days after discovery and results in the brief presence\nof two distinct components in the radio spectra, providing strong evidence for\nphysically separate outflows. Both flares are consistent with non-relativistic\noutflows, with velocities $v\\approx0.1-0.2c$ and energies $E\\sim10^{49}$ erg,\npropagating through a Bondi-like circumnuclear medium. Our analysis supports a\nscenario in which the first outflow is accretion-driven, launched while the TDE\ndisk is accreting at a relatively high Eddington fraction, whereas the second\noutflow is associated with a transition to an advection-dominated accretion\nflow. In contrast, the radio emission from AT 2021sdu is best explained by a\nslower ($v\\approx0.03c$), less energetic outflow ($E\\sim10^{48}$ erg), combined\nwith diffuse, non-variable host emission that becomes dominant $\\sim500$ days\nafter discovery. Assuming free expansion, we infer an outflow launch date\npreceding the optical discovery date.

These winds should be extremely fast and\ncarry a large amount of kinetic power, which, when associated with supermassive\nblack holes, would make them a prime contender for the feedback mechanism\nlinking the growth of those black holes with their host galaxies. Here we show\nthe XRISM Resolve spectrum of the Galactic neutron star X-ray binary, GX 13+1,\nwhich reveals one of the densest winds ever seen in absorption lines.

This new class of sources, called TeV halos, is\ncharacterized by a peculiar radial profile that, if properly resolved, is key\nto distinguishing them from other TeV sources that are associated with a\npulsar, such as supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae. In this\ncontribution, we consider all the pulsars which are spatially coincident with\nan unidentified extended TeV source, in order to quantify whether its spin-down\npower, age and distance allow the pulsar to produce a TeV halo with the\nobserved flux and extension. We also investigate how the next generation of\nImaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), namely the Cherenkov\nTelescope Array Observatory (CTAO) and the ASTRI Mini-Array, will observe and\ncharacterize these TeV halos. We present a set of simulated sources with the\nexpected morphology and spectrum, and we show for which of them we can\ndistinguish between TeV halos and other classes of extended sources."}

As a\nconsequence of the encounter, both the X-ray and radio emission from the gas\nare expected to be enhanced by shocks and turbulence, facilitating their\ndetection. PSZ2 G279.79+39.09 is likely an off-axis merging system at $z =\n0.29$, with its two main components observed shortly after pericenter passage.\nIn this paper, we investigate the presence of diffuse radio emission in this\nsystem. We observed the cluster pair with the MeerKAT UHF band (544-1088 MHz)\nfor 7.5 h and uGMRT band 3 (300-500 MHz) for 8 h. These are the first targeted\nradio observations of this system. We discover diffuse synchrotron emission in\nthe system, with indication of enhanced emission in the region bridging the\ncluster pair. The detection is based on MeerKAT UHF data, while uGMRT band 3\nobservations do not allow us to derive a stringent limit on the spectral index\nof the source. This emission is likely generated by the turbulence injected in\nthe early stage after the cluster-cluster encounter. However, the study of its\nphysical properties is limited by the current data. As other systems with\nmultiple cluster components studied in recent years, this cluster pair\nrepresents an appealing target to probe nonthermal phenomena beyond the\nwell-studied denser regions of the intracluster medium. While we report a new\ndetection, our analysis highlights the need for multi-band observations to\nfully understand these sources."}

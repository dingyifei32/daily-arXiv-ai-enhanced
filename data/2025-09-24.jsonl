However, nearly all past\nstudies of gamma ray emission make simplifying assumptions about cosmic ray\n(CR) propagation that may not be valid in the galactic center. Recent numerical\nbreakthroughs now enable fully time dependent dynamical evolution of CRs in\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations with resolved, multi phase small scale\nstructure in the interstellar medium (ISM), allowing self consistent\ncomparisons to the Milky Way cosmic ray spectrum. We model diffuse gamma ray\nemission from cosmic ray interactions for a set of Feedback in Realistic\nEnvironments (FIRE) simulations of Milky Way mass galaxies run with spectrally\nresolved cosmic ray spectra for multiple species at MeV to TeV energies. We\nfind that the galactic center gamma ray spectrum can vary by order of magnitude\namounts in normalization, and by approx. 10 percent in spectral slope at high\nenergies, driven by both injection from highly variable star formation and\nlosses from variable structure in the turbulent ISM.

In\nthis work, we present a self-consistent framework to study catalog\nincompleteness and host weighting effects, implemented in the publicly\navailable CHIMERA pipeline. We obtain joint cosmological and astrophysical\npopulation constraints from 100 binary black hole (BBH) events in a\nLIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O5-like configuration, using spectroscopic galaxy catalogs\nwith varying completeness levels and stellar-mass host weighting schemes. We\nfind percent-level constraints on $H_0$ with complete catalogs, reaching\nprecision of 1.6%, 1.3%, and 0.9% for constant, linear, and quadratic mass\nweighting, respectively. As completeness decreases, the precision degrades\nfollowing a sigmoid trend, with a threshold and steepness that increase for\nstronger weightings. Simultaneously, the correlation between $H_0$ and the BBH\npopulation mass scale also increases, making results more sensitive to\nassumptions about the astrophysical population. Remarkably, 2% precision\nremains achievable when catalogs contain only 50% of the potential host\ngalaxies within the gravitational wave detection horizon, while 1% precision\nrequires host probabilities scaling with stellar mass squared.

Despite\nthe numerous alternative interpretations, the origin of the plateau remains\nunclear. In the early years of Swift, it was suggested that the plateau might\nbe afterglow radiation, that started before the prompt gamma-ray emission, and\nits time profile would be an artefact of assuming the start time of the prompt\ngamma-ray emission as zero time (the so-called \"prior activity model\"). We aim\nto test this scenario by leveraging the current Swift sample of early X-ray\nafterglows of GRBs with measured redshifts. We modelled the GRB rest-frame\nX-ray afterglow luminosities assuming a simple power-law with the true\nreference time preceding the prompt gamma-ray emission trigger time by T_0 and\nthe X-ray luminosity L_0 at the trigger time as free parameters. For 90% GRBs\nof our sample, the model provided a successful description. In 10 cases the\nafterglow peak is identified and modelled appropriately. Using the 300 GRBs\nwith accurate parameters' estimates, we confirm the anti-correlation between\nL_0 and T_0 with 0.7 dex scatter.

This scenario requires a mechanism to power its\npersistent and strong non-thermal emission. We investigate a mechanism in which\nthe non-steady interaction structure of the stellar and the NS winds can\nregularly excite NS magnetospheric activity, releasing extra energy and fueling\nthe source non-thermal emission. The NS wind shocked by the stellar wind can\nrecurrently touch the NS magnetosphere, triggering magnetic instabilities whose\ngrowth can release extra energy into the NS wind in a cyclic manner. To\nillustrate and study the impact of these cycles on the two-wind interaction\nstructure on different scales, we performed relativistic hydrodynamics\nsimulations in 2D and 3D with periods of an enhanced power in the NS wind along\nthe orbit. We also used analytical tools to characterize processes near the NS\nrelevant for the non-thermal emission. As the NS wind termination shock touches\nthe magnetosphere energy dissipation occurs, but the whole shocked two-wind\nstructure is eventually driven away halting the extra energy injection.\nHowever, due to the corresponding drop in the NS wind ram pressure, the\ntermination shock propagates back towards the magnetosphere, resuming the\nprocess. These activity cycles excite strong waves in the shocked flows,\nintensifying their mixing and the disruption of their spiral-like structure\nproduced by orbital motion. Further downstream, the shocked winds can become a\nquasi-stable, relatively smooth flow. The recurrent interaction between the NS\nmagnetosphere and shocked wind can fuel a relativistic outflow powerful enough\nto explain the non-thermal emission of LS 5039.

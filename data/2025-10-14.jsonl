This\nhas a substantial impact on the topology of reionization and thus the prospects\nof tomography of the 21-cm signal from upcoming radio interferometers. In this\nwork we develop the first analytic model of reionization which explicitly\nincorporates the MFP as a free parameter, allowing us to transparently explore\nits effect on the process. Our model is based on the excursion set formalism\nwith an ionization condition which accounts for absorptions parameterized\nthrough the MFP. With the goal of observational comparison, we include\nadditional modifications which make our model particularly suitable for\npredicting one-point statistics of the ionization field (and 21-cm signal),\nwhich are among the fundamental quantities for tomography. We find that the\neffect of the MFP is much more significant during the later stages of\nreionization, and that including a shorter MFP reduces the size of HII regions\nby around an order of magnitude towards the end of reionization compared with\nanalytic models which do not account for the MFP. We find that the reported MFP\nvalue produces a contrast in the 21-cm signal of $\\mathcal{O}$(1 mK) or less at\nresolutions $\\theta \\sim $ 15--35 arcmin, an order of magnitude below naive\nestimates and up to a factor of several smaller than when using a larger MFP\nvalue extrapolated from low $z$, requiring significantly more sensitivity for\nimaging. We compare the contrast to noise estimates for arrays similar in size\nto HERA and SKA-Low and find that SKA has sufficient sensitivity for direct\nimaging (at the largest scales considered), while the predicted signal will be\nchallenging for arrays similar in size to HERA. Our model indicates that more\ndetailed sensitivity estimates are warranted in the context of a short MFP."}

Medium-resolution JWST spectroscopy\nreveals novel narrow ($v_{\\mathrm{FWHM}}<1500$ km s$^{-1}$) [Ni II] 1.94 and\n6.64 micron cores in both events. The MIR [Ni II] 6.64 micron line exhibits a\ndistinct narrow core atop a broader base, indicating a central enhancement of\nstable Ni. This structure points to high central densities consistent with a\nnear-Chandrasekhar-mass ($M_{Ch}$) progenitor or a high-metallicity\nsub-$M_{Ch}$ progenitor. From detailed line-profile inversions of SN 2024gy, we\nderive emissivity profiles for stable iron-group elements (IGEs), radioactive\nmaterial, and intermediate-mass elements (IMEs), revealing spatially distinct\nejecta zones. The [Ni III] 7.35 micron line shows a shallow-to-steep slope\ntransition - a \"broken-slope\" morphology - that matches predictions for delayed\ndetonation explosions with separated deflagration and detonation ashes. We also\nreanalyze and compare to archival JWST spectra of SN 2021aefx and the\nsubluminous SN 2022xkq. We estimate a stable $^{58}$Ni mass of $\\sim0.1$\nM$_\\odot$ for SN 2024gy, consistent with delayed detonation models, and\n$\\sim0.01$ M$_\\odot$ for SN 2022xkq, favoring sub-$M_{Ch}$ scenarios.

In this work, we use the European VLBI Network (EVN) to\n(re-)localise FRB 20121102A and its associated persistent radio source (PRS).\nWe confirm that the two are co-located -- improving on previous results by a\nfactor of ~4 and constraining the FRB and PRS co-location to ~12 pc transverse\noffset. Over a decade, the PRS luminosity on milliarcsecond scales remains\nconsistent with measurements on larger angular scales, showing that the PRS is\nstill compact. We also present the detection of 18 bursts with the Nancay Radio\nTelescope (NRT) as part of our \\'ECLAT monitoring program. These bursts,\ntogether with previously published results, show that the observed dispersion\nmeasure (DM) of FRB 20121102A has dropped by ~25 pc/cc in the past five years,\nhighlighting a fractional decrease in the local DM contribution of >15%. We\ndiscuss potential physical scenarios and highlight possible future observations\nthat will help reveal the nature of FRB 20121102A, which is one of only a few\nknown FRBs with a luminous PRS."}

Accepted", "summary": "The black holes in the Event Horizon Telescope sources Messier 87* and\nSagittarius A* (SgrA*) are embedded in a hot, collisionless plasma that is\nfully described in kinetic theory yet is usually modeled as an ideal,\nmagnetized fluid. In this Letter, we present results from a new set of weakly\ncollisional fluid simulations in which leading order kinetic effects are\nmodeled as viscosity and heat conduction. Consistent with earlier,\nlower-resolution studies, we find that overall flow dynamics remain very\nsimilar between ideal and non-ideal models. For the first time, we synthesize\nimages and spectra of SgrA* from weakly collisional models -- assuming an\nisotropic, thermal population of electrons -- and find that these remain\nlargely indistinguishable from ideal fluid predictions. However, most weakly\ncollisional models exhibit lower light curve variability, with all magnetically\ndominated models showing a small but systematic decrease in variability."}

Previous work studied the temporal behavior of some magnetar\nbursts and employed the Fast Rise Exponential Decay (FRED) model to fit pulses\nof MXB. However, whether there is other kind of pulse shape has not been\nexplored. In this study, we systematically examined light curve of MXBs from\nSGR J1935+2154 detected by GECAM between 2021 and 2022. We find that there are\ndifferent light curve morphologies. Especially, we discover a peculiar and new\npattern, Exponential Rise and Cut-Off Decay (ERCOD), which is significantly\ndifferent from FRED and could be well described by a mathematical function we\nproposed. We find that MXBs with ERCOD shape are generally longer in duration,\nbrighter in the peak flux, and harder in spectrum. We note that the ERCOD shape\nis not unique to SGR J1935+2154 but also present in other magnetars. This new\nlight curve pattern may imply a special burst and radiation mechanism of\nmagnetar."}

We model the source spectra using\nabsorbed power-law and absorbed multicolour disc blackbody models. The best-fit\nphoton indices span 0.92-2.68, with typical uncertainties ranging from $\\pm$0.1\nto $\\pm$1 depending on data quality. The inner disk temperature range from 0.97\nto 1.69 keV, consistent with blackbody emission from an accretion disk. Our\nresults reveal significant long-term variability in intrinsic X-ray source\nfluxes while the source remains relatively stable within individual\nobservations. A Hardness-Intensity Diagram of the source shows no clear\ntransition between hard and soft states, but an increase in brightness during\ntwo recent observations taken on 2022 December 1 and 2024 May 4. We find a\npositive correlation of X-ray luminosity and photon index that persists even\nwhen the hydrogen column density is tied across observations, suggesting a\nphysical origin. The X-ray luminosity-inner disk temperature relation yields a\nweakly constrained slope owing to large temperature uncertainties, but a\nsimpler fixed-slope test indicates consistency with a standard thin-disk. Using\nthe derived disk parameters, we estimate the black hole mass to lie in the\nrange of 16-75 $M_{\\odot}$, under the assumption of a geometrically thin\naccretion flow, where the lower and upper bounds correspond to a Schwarzchild\nand a Kerr black hole respectively. Alternatively, we consider the scenario of\nULX-8 hosting an accreting neutron star and estimate the corresponding magnetic\nfield strength required to explain the observed properties."}

Besides the widely studied $s$, $i$, and $r$ processes in\nmoderately-to-strongly neutron-rich environments, an intriguing alternative\nsite for lanthanide production could in fact be robustly $\\textit{proton-rich}$\nmatter outflows from core-collapse supernovae under specific conditions -- in\nparticular, high-entropy winds with enhanced neutrino luminosity and fast\ndynamical timescales. In this environment, excess protons present after charged\nparticle reactions have ceased can continue to be converted to neutrons by\n(anti-)neutrino interactions, producing a neutron capture reaction flow up to\nA~200. This scenario, christened the $\\nu i$ process in a recent paper, has\npreviously been discussed as a possibility. Here, we examine the prospects for\n$\\nu i$ process through the lens of stellar abundance patterns, bolometric\nlightcurves, and galactic chemical evolution models, with a particular focus on\nhypernovae as candidate sites.

Submitted to ApJ", "summary": "Compact binary millisecond pulsars (also known as spiders) allow us to probe\npulsar winds in their innermost regions, between the light cylinder (radius\n$\\sim10^{7}$ cm) and the companion star (at $\\sim10^{11}$ cm). Their flux is\nknown to vary along the orbit, from radio to X-rays. During the past decade,\ngamma-ray orbital modulation (GOM) has been discovered in a handful of spiders,\nbut its origin remains largely unknown. We present the results of a systematic\nsearch for GOM among 43 systems, selecting pulsed 0.1-1 GeV photons and using\nspin and orbital ephemeris from Fermi's Third Pulsar Catalog. We discover GOM\nfrom three spiders - PSR J1124-3653, PSR J1946-5403 and PSR J2215+5135 - and\nconfirm four previous detections. In all seven cases so far, the GOM peaks near\nthe pulsar's superior conjunction. The X-ray orbital light curves are usually\nin anti-phase, peaking when the pulsar is at inferior conjunction, but we find\none case where both gamma-rays and X-rays peak around superior conjunction: PSR\nJ1946-5403. We measure the modulated fractions of the GOM and find consistent\nvalues for all seven spiders, with an average $22.0\\pm2.6\\%$. Including\neclipsing systems seen edge-on, we find no clear dependence of the modulated\nfraction on the orbital inclination (within $\\simeq$45-90$^\\circ$). Our results\nchallenge previous models proposed to explain GOM in spiders, based on inverse\nCompton and synchrotron emission close to the companion, since these predict a\nclear dependence with orbital inclination (stronger modulation at high\ninclinations). We nearly double the number of GOM detections in spiders,\nshowing that it is more common than previously thought."}

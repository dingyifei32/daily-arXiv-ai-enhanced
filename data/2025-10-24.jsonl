Comments welcome", "summary": "Recent work has developed a formalism for computing angular power spectra\ndirectly from catalogues containing field values at discrete positions on the\nsky, thereby circumventing the need to create pixelised maps of the fields, as\nwell as avoiding aliasing and finite-resolution effects. Here, we adapt this\nformalism to incorporate template deprojection as a means of mitigating\nsystematic biases in the measured angular power spectra. We also introduce and\nvalidate an alternative method of mitigating the so-called `deprojection bias',\ncaused by the loss of modes after deprojection, employing the use of simple\nsimulations to compute a transfer function. We find that this approach performs\nat least as well as existing methods, and is relatively insensitive to how well\none can guess the true power spectrum of the observed field, except at the\nlargest scales ($\\ell \\lesssim 3$). Additionally, we develop exact expressions\nfor the bias introduced by deprojection in the shot-noise component, which\nfurther improves the accuracy of this approach. We test our formalism on\nsimulated datasets, demonstrating its applicability both to discretely sampled\nfields, and to the special case of galaxy clustering, with the survey selection\nfunction defined in terms of a random catalogue or as a continuous sky map.\nAfter computing and removing the bias in the shot noise and using a transfer\nfunction to correct for the remaining mode loss, our formalism is able to\nproduce unbiased measurements of the angular power spectrum in all scenarios\ntested here. Finally, we apply our formalism to real data and demonstrate that\nit produces results consistent with the standard map-based pseudo-$C_\\ell$\nformalism. We implement our method in the publicly available code NaMaster."}

A key\nchallenge with standard sirens is detecting their electromagnetic counterparts,\nand therefore assigning redshifts to the measured distances.

We present a quantitative study of how precisely the\nHubble constant can be measured using tomographic cross-correlation between\ngalaxies and GW sources.

This implies that, when\naveraging over a sufficiently large and distant set of sources where local\nnonlinear inhomogeneities are diminished, such a difference should vanish, so\nthat the Hubble flow is statistically uniform, as predicted by the Cosmological\nPrinciple -- a core assumption of the standard cosmological paradigm. In\nprevious works, distance measurement compilations, e.g. the CosmicFlows-3\ncatalogue, were used for this purpose, as it comprises a large number ($\\sim\n10^4$) of sources of different types. Due to the increasing amount of precise\nluminosity distance measurements of Type Ia Supenovae (SNe) in the last few\nyears, in this work we investigate whether we can confirm the uniformity of the\nHubble flow with low-$z$ SN distances only. By means of the Pantheon+ and SH0ES\ncompilation, we find that the results align well with previous works based on\nthe CF3 catalogue, and are in good agreement with the expected Hubble variance\nin the standard model across cosmic scales of $20-150$ Mpc. Notably, the Hubble\nconstant difference $\\Delta H_0 \\approx 0$ is observed at around $85$ Mpc.\nDespite the smaller sample size ($\\sim 10^2$ versus $\\sim 10^4$) relative to\nCF3 at those scales, our analysis show that the Pantheon+ and SH0ES dataset\nsupports the standard model paradigm, which indicates that the Hubble flow\nbecomes statistically uniform at around $70-100$ Mpc, which is compatible with\nindependent determinations of the homogeneity scale based on galaxy number\ncounts."}

The local nature of this\nframework allows for focusing computational power close to the binary at the\nexpense of detaching the gas flow around the binary from the global dynamics.\nIn this paper, we provide a framework to assess the applicability of the\nshearing box for studying the long-term evolution of the orbital elements of\nthe embedded binary in viscous hydrodynamic disks.

Previous works have performed searches for counterpart candidates in\ntransient catalogs and have identified active galactic nuclei (AGN) flares\ncoincident with GW events; existing theory predicts that such flares may arise\nfrom the interaction of the merger remnant with the embedding accretion disk\nenvironment. We apply a statistical formalism to measure the significance of\ncoincidence for the catalog as a whole, measuring that less than 3\\% (90\\%\ncredible interval) of LVK BBH mergers give rise to observable AGN flares. This\nresult still allows up to $\\sim 40\\%$ of BBH mergers to originate in AGN disks.\nWe also examine the individual coincidences of each merger/flare pairing,\ndetermining that in all cases the flares are more likely to belong to a\nbackground population of flares not associated with GW events. Our results are\nconsistent with theoretical predictions accounting for the observability of EM\ncounterparts in AGN disks, as well as based on the fact that the most massive\nAGNs (such as those included in the search) are not expected to harbor the\nmajority of the BBHs.

Given the expected low amplitude of the signal, its estimate,\nparametrized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, is highly susceptible to\ncontamination from Galactic foreground residuals that remain after component\nseparation. In this work, we introduce an agnostic, model-independent procedure\nto construct a spectral template of residual foreground contamination in the\nobserved angular power spectrum. Specifically, a cleaned multifrequency set of\nforeground-emission maps is blindly reconstructed from the observed data using\nthe Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (GNILC) technique. These\nmaps are then combined with the weights adopted for CMB reconstruction,\nyielding an estimate of the spatial distribution of foreground residuals after\ncomponent separation. The power spectrum of this residual map, after proper\nnoise debiasing, is incorporated into the spectral model of the cosmological\nlikelihood, thereby enabling unbiased inference of cosmological parameters. We\nvalidate the method on realistic simulations of a LiteBIRD-like experiment,\nfocusing on constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio.

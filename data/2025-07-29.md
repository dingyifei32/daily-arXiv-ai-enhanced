### [1] [Bound dark energy: Particle origin of dark energy with DESI BAO and DES supernova data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19619)
*Jose Agustin Lozano Torres,Axel de la Macorra*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: DESI数据支持动态暗能量模型BDE，优于ΛCDM和w0waCDM模型，且参数更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索暗能量的动态性质，提出更简洁的模型BDE，减少自由参数。

Method: 结合DESI BAO、CMB和SN Ia数据，验证BDE模型的拟合效果。

Result: BDE模型在χ²、AIC和BIC上表现更优，支持动态暗能量。

Conclusion: BDE模型为动态暗能量提供了更简洁且一致的物理解释。

Abstract: The recent findings from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)
indicate a preference for dynamical dark energy at a significance level above
$2.5 \sigma$, with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) combined with cosmic
microwave background (CMB) data and Type Ia supernovae (SNe) data, favoring a
time dependent equation of state $w(z)$ rather than the cosmological constant
($w = -1$). We introduce the Bound Dark Energy (BDE) model, in which dark
energy arises from the lightest meson field $\phi$ in a dark SU(3) gauge group,
developing dynamically through non perturbative interactions. Governed by an
inverse power law potential $V(\phi) = \Lambda_c^{4+2/3}\phi^{-2/3}$, BDE
features no dark energy free parameters: one less than $\Lambda$CDM ($\Lambda$)
and three less than the $ w_{0}w_{a} $CDM ($ w_{0}, w_{a},\Lambda $) models. By
integrating DESI BAO measurements, CMB data and Dark Energy Survey SN Ia
distance data collected during the fifth year, BDE demonstrates a reduction of
$42$ and $37$ percent in the reduced $\chi^{2}_{BAO}$ as well as lower AIC and
BIC values compared to the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM and $\Lambda$CDM models,
respectively, while maintaining a comparable fit for both type Ia supernovae
and the cosmic microwave background data. Although the ($w_{0},w_{a}$) contour
in BDE is 10,000 times smaller than that found in the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM model,
the BDE model suggests a dynamical dark energy scenario with precise values of
$w_{0}=$-0.9301 $\pm$ 0.0004 and $w_{a}=$ -0.8085 $\pm$ 0.0053 while providing
a consistency on the six Planck and derived parameters at the 1$\sigma$ level
between BDE, $\Lambda$CDM and $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM models. The critical parameters
condensation energy scale $\Lambda_{c} = 43.806 \pm 0.190$ eV and epoch $a_{c}
= (2.497 \pm 0.011) \times 10^{-6}$ are consistent with predictions from high
energy physics.

### [2] [Cosmological observational tests in the JWST Era I: angular size - redshift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19651)
*A. A. Raikov,V. V. Tsymbal,N. Yu. Lovyagin*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 研究分析了ASTRODEEP-JWST目录中星系的角度和线性大小，比较了标准ΛCDM模型和静态模型下的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨宇宙学中的“角度大小-红移”测试，验证不同宇宙模型下星系线性大小的演化。

Method: 使用ASTRODEEP-JWST目录中的6860个光谱红移星系和319,771个测光红移星系，计算线性大小，比较ΛCDM模型和静态模型。

Result: ΛCDM模型中星系线性大小显著演化，与宇宙膨胀速率匹配；静态模型中几乎无演化。

Conclusion: 结果支持ΛCDM模型的动态宇宙观，静态模型与观测不符。

Abstract: This study is denoted to the cosmological "angular size - redshift" test. An
analysis is performed of the angular and linear sizes of galaxies from the new
ASTRODEEP-JWST catalogue, which contains over 500,000 objects at high redshifts
(up to ~20 photometrically determined and up to ~14 spectroscopically
determined). For the calculations, 6 860 galaxies with reliably determined
spectroscopic redshifts and 319,771 galaxies with known photometric redshifts
were used. The linear sizes of galaxies were computed within the framework of
two cosmological models - the standard ({\Lambda}CDM) model and one of the
static models (the so-called "tired light" model). We shown that within the
framework of the {\Lambda}CDM model, a significant evolution of the linear
sizes of galaxies is observed, with the rate of the evolution closely matching
the rate of the cosmic expansion. In contrast, in the static model, the
characteristic linear sizes of a galaxies exhibit almost no evolution with
increasing z.

### [3] [From South to North: Leveraging Ground-Based LATs for Full-Sky CMB Delensing and Constraints on $r$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19897)
*Wen-Zheng Chen,Yang Liu,Yi-Ming Wang,Hong Li*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 研究评估了在北半球引入大型望远镜（LATN）对CMB去透镜化效果和原始引力波（PGW）探测的影响，发现LATN能显著提升去透镜化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下一代CMB实验需要通过B模式偏振探测原始引力波，而去透镜化是关键挑战。现有和计划中的大型望远镜仅在南半球，限制了去透镜化的效果。

Method: 通过模拟实验，比较了南半球LAT、北半球LATN以及外部大尺度结构（LSS）数据对去透镜化和PGW探测的影响。

Result: 南半球LAT使r的不确定性降低21%，加入LATN后进一步降低19%。LSS数据初始贡献17%，但加入LATN后边际效益降至10%。

Conclusion: 北半球LATN能显著提升去透镜化能力，对PGW探测约束有重要贡献。

Abstract: Delensing--the process of mitigating the lensing-induced B-mode contamination
in cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations--will be a pivotal challenge
for next-generation CMB experiments seeking to detect primordial gravitational
waves (PGWs) through B-mode polarization. This process requires an accurate
lensing tracer, which can be obtained either through internal reconstruction
from high-resolution CMB observations or from external large-scale structure
(LSS) surveys. Ground-based large-aperture telescopes (LATs) are crucial for
internal reconstruction, yet existing and planned facilities are confined to
the southern hemisphere, limiting effective delensing to that region. In this
work, we assess the impact of introducing a northern hemisphere LAT, assumed to
be situated near AliCPT (hence termed Ali-like LAT, or LATN), on delensing
performance and PGW detection, using simulations. Our baseline setup includes a
space-based small-aperture mission (LiteBIRD-like, SAT) and a southern LAT
(SO-like, LATS). External LSS tracers, which have been shown to play an
important role in delensing before the availability of ultra-sensitive
polarization data, are also considered. We find that southern-hemisphere
internal delensing reduces the uncertainty in r by approximately 21% compared
to the no-delensing case. Adding LATN enables full-sky internal delensing,
achieving a further ~19% reduction--comparable to that from including LSS
tracers (~17%). Once LATN is included, the marginal benefit of LSS tracers
drops to ~10%. These results highlight the significant role of LATN in
advancing delensing capabilities and improving PGW constraints.

### [4] [Directional Neutrino Bursts from Spinning and Moving Primordial Black Holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20207)
*Arnab Chaudhuri,Priya Mishra,Rukmani Mohanta*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 研究显示，具有显著自旋和整体运动的原初黑洞（PBHs）通过霍金辐射产生高度准直的中微子爆发，其能谱被提升至多GeV至数百GeV范围，显著增强了探测可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自旋PBHs通过霍金辐射产生的中微子爆发特征，为PBHs作为暗物质候选者提供新的探测手段。

Method: 结合自旋引起的角各向异性和相对论多普勒效应，计算实验室参考系中的中微子分布，并利用IceCube和KM3NeT的非观测数据更新PBHs数密度限制。

Result: 发现方向性高能中微子爆发是自旋PBHs的独特特征，其能谱范围和通量增强显著提高了探测潜力。

Conclusion: 方向性高能中微子爆发可作为自旋PBHs的测试标志，为PBH暗物质假说和霍金辐射提供补充验证。

Abstract: We show that primordial black holes (PBHs) with significant spin and bulk
motion produce sharply collimated neutrino bursts from Hawking evaporation,
arising from the interplay of spin-induced angular anisotropy and relativistic
Doppler boosting. This effect shifts the neutrino spectrum into the multi-GeV
to hundreds of GeV range, where atmospheric backgrounds drop steeply, and
enhances the flux by orders of magnitude within a narrow forward cone. We
compute the full lab-frame neutrino distribution and derive updated constraints
on PBH number density from non-observation of such bursts in IceCube and
KM3NeT. Our results identify directional high-energy neutrino bursts as a
distinctive, testable signature of spinning PBHs, providing a complementary
probe of the PBH dark matter hypothesis and Hawking radiation.

### [5] [Future Parameter Constraints from Weak Lensing CMB and Galaxy Lensing Power- and Bispectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20262)
*Jonas Frugte,P. Daniel Meerburg*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 未来第四阶段巡天项目（如Simons Observatory、LSST和Euclid）将以前所未有的精度测量宇宙微波背景（CMB）和星系的弱引力透镜效应。研究预测了利用CMB和星系巡天的弱透镜功率谱和双谱（包括交叉相关）约束宇宙学参数的能力，发现双谱在弱先验下能显著改善参数约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索未来巡天项目利用高阶统计量（如双谱）提取更多宇宙学信息的潜力，特别是在非高斯性和非线性结构增长方面。

Method: 采用八参数模型（ΛCDM + ∑mν + w0），评估第四阶段巡天的约束能力，测试强先验和弱先验下的效果，并考虑后玻恩修正。

Result: 双谱在弱先验下能显著改善参数约束，尤其在非线性主导的小尺度上；CMB与星系透镜的联合使用可进一步约束中微子质量。

Conclusion: 高阶透镜统计量（如双谱）具有重要潜力，但需进一步研究非高斯协方差、仪器系统效应和重子反馈等被忽视的影响。

Abstract: Upcoming stage 4 surveys, such as the Simons Observatory, LSST, and Euclid,
are poised to measure weak gravitational lensing of the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) and galaxies with unprecedented precision. While the power
spectrum is the standard statistic used to analyze weak lensing data,
non-Gaussianity from non-linear structure growth encodes additional
cosmological information in higher-order statistics. We forecast the ability of
future surveys to constrain cosmological parameters using the weak lensing
power spectrum and bispectrum from both CMB and galaxy surveys, including their
cross-correlations. We consider an eight-parameter model ($\Lambda$CDM + $\sum
m_\nu$ + $w_0$) and assess constraints for stage 4 survey specifications. In
the absence of systematics, both the CMB and galaxy lensing bispectra are found
to be detectable at high signal-to-noise. We test two priors: a ''strong'' one
based on constraints from CMB temperature and $E$-mode polarization
anisotropies, and a ''weak'' one with minimal assumptions. With the weak prior,
the bispectrum significantly improves parameter constraints by breaking
degeneracies. For strong priors, improvements are more limited, especially for
the CMB bispectrum. On small scales, where non-linear effects dominate, the
bispectrum's constraining power can rival that of the power spectrum. We also
find strong synergy between CMB and galaxy lensing; combining both probes leads
to tighter constraints, particularly on neutrino mass. It was recently found
that the CMB lensing bispectrum is strongly affected by the Born approximation,
so we also consider post-Born corrections but find that our main conclusions
remain the same. These results highlight the potential of higher-order lensing
statistics and motivate further work on neglected effects such as non-Gaussian
covariance, instrumental systematics, and baryonic feedback.

### [6] [A Comparative Study of Halo Mass Estimates from Group Catalogs and Lensing Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20294)
*Xinyue Chen,Weiwei Xu,Ran Li,Huanyuan Shan,Ji Yao,Chunxiang Wang*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 比较三个星系群目录（redMaPPer、Yang21和Zou21）的晕质量估计与引力透镜测量结果，发现redMaPPer在低红移组中表现最佳，Yang21包含低质量组但存在偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估不同星系群目录在质量估计上的准确性，以改进红移依赖的校准和群定义。

Method: 使用质量-丰富度关系、丰度匹配和光度校准等方法，对比引力透镜测量结果。

Result: redMaPPer在低红移组中表现最好，Yang21对低质量组估计存在偏差。

Conclusion: 强调红移依赖校准和精细群定义对准确质量估计的重要性。

Abstract: We compare halo mass estimates from three galaxy group catalogs (redMaPPer,
Yang21, and Zou21) with those derived from gravitational lensing measurements.
Each catalog employs distinct methodologies, including mass-richness relations,
abundance matching, and luminosity-based calibration. A linear correlation is
observed between catalog-estimated and lensing-derived masses. The redMaPPer
catalog shows the best agreement, especially for lower-redshift groups, with
minor deviations in higher-redshift bins. Yang21 is the only catalog containing
low mass groups, which gives a reasonably good mass estimation, except for the
lowest mass bin. Cross-matched groups between redMaPPer and Yang21 reveal the
former catalog provides more accurate mass estimation, while the Yang21 makes
under-estimation of halo mass for those sharing the central galaxy with
redMaPPer and over-estimation of halo mass for those with different center
determination with redMaPPer and for the unique Yang21 groups. These findings
emphasize the importance of redshift-dependent calibration and refined group
definitions for accurate mass estimation.

### [7] [Superhorizon fluctuations and the cosmic dipole problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20462)
*Ge Chen,Chengcheng Han,Linwei Qiu*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 论文探讨了超视界等曲率扰动是否能解释宇宙偶极子与CMB偶极子之间的差异，提出了两种模型并约束了轴子自耦合范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观测发现星系数量与CMB的宇宙偶极子存在显著差异，可能违背宇宙学原理，需寻找解释。

Method: 研究超视界等曲率扰动对偶极子的影响，分析单模和连续谱模型，重点关注轴子诱导的扰动。

Result: 超视界等曲率扰动能解释观测差异，轴子模型的自耦合范围被约束为$10^{-9} < \lambda < 4 \times 10^{-9}$。

Conclusion: 研究为偶极子差异提供了可行解释，并可能间接支持轴子暗物质的存在。

Abstract: Recent observations have identified a significant 4.9$\sigma$ tension between
the cosmic dipole inferred from galaxy number counts and that derived from the
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), suggesting a potential deviation from the
cosmological principle. This work investigates whether superhorizon
isocurvature perturbations in cold dark matter (CDM) can account for this
discrepancy. We demonstrate that, unlike adiabatic modes which cancel at
leading order, superhorizon isocurvature modes can generate an intrinsic CMB
dipole without significantly affecting galaxy number counts, thereby explaining
the observed mismatch. We explore both single-mode and continuous-spectrum
cases, focusing on two concrete models: a nearly scale-invariant power-law
spectrum with a UV cutoff and axion-induced isocurvature perturbations. For the
axion scenario, we show that if the radial mode evolves during inflation, the
resulting perturbations can match the required amplitude while evading current
CMB constraints. Our analysis constrains the self-coupling of associated
potential for the axion to the range $10^{-9} < \lambda < 4 \times 10^{-9}$.
These findings offer a viable solution to the dipole tension and may serve as
indirect evidence for axion dark matter.

### [8] [The Concordance of Weak Lensing and Escape Velocity Mass Estimates for Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20938)
*Alexander Rodriguez,Christopher J. Miller*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 论文比较了两种星系团质量测量方法（弱引力透镜与逃逸速度剖面），发现两者在46个星系团中表现出良好一致性，相关性显著，平均差异接近零。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证在ΛCDM框架下，弱引力透镜与逃逸速度剖面两种独立质量测量方法的一致性，解决先前研究中两者相关性为零的问题。

Method: 基于逃逸边缘测量的最新进展，对46个星系团（0.05≤z≤0.3，质量范围14.4≤log10M/M⊙≤15.4）进行两种方法的比较分析。

Result: 两种方法相关性显著（0.679），平均差异接近零（0.02±0.02 dex），散射（0.17 dex）与个体误差一致，无需额外内在成分。

Conclusion: 结果支持两种方法的一致性，强调了各自系统误差的重要性，并对宇宙学应用具有实际意义。

Abstract: In the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, the masses of the galaxy clusters inferred
using background galaxies via weak-lensing shear should agree with the masses
measured using the galaxy projected radius-velocity phase-space data via the
escape velocity profile. However, prior work indicates that the correlation
between caustic-inferred escape masses and weak lensing masses is statistically
consistent with zero. Based on recent advancements in the measurement of the
escape edge and its physical interpretation, we conduct a revised comparison
between these two independent mass inference techniques for 46 galaxy clusters
between $0.05 \le z \le 0.3$ and over an order of magnitude in mass, $14.4 \le
{\rm log}_{10} M/M_{\odot} \le 15.4$. We find excellent agreement, with a
correlation ($0.679^{+0.046}_{-0.049}$), and a mean relative difference between
the two mass measurements consistent with zero (0.02 $\pm$ 0.02 dex). The
observed scatter between these direct mass estimates is 0.17 dex and is
consistent with the reported individual mass errors, suggesting that there is
no need for an additional intrinsic component. We discuss the important
practical consequences of these results, focusing on the systematic
uncertainties inherent to each technique, and their implications for cosmology.

### [9] [PyBird-JAX: Accelerated inference in large-scale structure with model-independent emulation of one-loop galaxy power spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20990)
*Alexander Reeves,Pierre Zhang,Henry Zheng*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: PyBird-JAX是一个基于JAX的可微分实现，通过神经网络加速器显著提升大规模结构分析的效率，速度比PyBird快3-4个数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了满足未来大规模结构（LSS）调查对高效、精确计算的需求，开发一个快速且可微分的工具。

Method: 使用内部神经网络模拟器加速计算，采用紧凑的样条基表示输入线性功率谱，支持自动微分和多种采样器接口。

Result: 在CPU和GPU上分别实现1.2 ms和0.2 ms的计算速度，验证了其在大规模模拟和BOSS数据上的准确性。

Conclusion: PyBird-JAX为LSS调查提供了高效、精确的推断工具，支持快速收敛的MCMC分析。

Abstract: We present $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$, a differentiable, $\texttt{JAX}$-based
implementation of $\texttt{PyBird}$, using internal neural network emulators to
accelerate computationally costly operations for rapid large-scale structure
(LSS) analysis. $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ computes one-loop EFTofLSS predictions
for redshift-space galaxy power spectrum multipoles in 1.2 ms on a CPU and 0.2
ms on a GPU, achieving 3-4 orders of magnitude speed-up over $\texttt{PyBird}$.
The emulators take a compact spline-based representation of the input linear
power spectrum $P(k)$ as feature vectors, making the approach applicable to a
wide range of cosmological models. We rigorously validate its accuracy against
large-volume simulations and on BOSS data, including cosmologies not explicitly
represented in the training set. Leveraging automatic differentiation,
$\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ supports Fisher forecasting, Taylor expansion of model
predictions, gradient-based searches, and vectorised ensemble sampling.
Interfaced with a variety of samplers and Boltzmann solvers,
$\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ provides a high-performance, end-to-end inference
pipeline. Combined with a symbolic-$P(k)$ generator, a typical Stage-4 LSS MCMC
converges in minutes on a GPU. Our results demonstrate that
$\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ delivers the precision and speed required for upcoming
LSS surveys, opening the door to accelerated cosmological inference with
minimal accuracy loss and no pretraining. In a companion paper [1], we put
$\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ to use in achieving LSS marginalised constraints free
from volume projection effects through non-flat measures.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过非平坦体积度量来减少贝叶斯推断中体积投影效应偏差的方法，并在宇宙学参数分析中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决贝叶斯推断中因参数空间增大导致的体积投影效应偏差问题。

Method: 定义基于非平坦体积度量的期望值，使后验均值无偏，并通过拉普拉斯展开验证。

Result: 在宇宙学参数分析中，非平坦度量将偏差从1-2σ降低到<0.1σ。

Conclusion: 非平坦体积度量能有效纠正体积投影效应偏差，适用于高维参数空间分析。

Abstract: Increasingly large parameter spaces, used to more accurately model precision
observables in physics, can paradoxically lead to large deviations in the
inferred parameters of interest -- a bias known as volume projection effects --
when marginalising over many nuisance parameters. For posterior distributions
that admit a Laplace expansion, we show that this artefact of Bayesian
inference can be mitigated by defining expectation values with respect to a
non-flat volume measure, such that the posterior mean becomes unbiased on
average. We begin by finding a measure that ensures the mean is an unbiased
estimator of the mode. Although the mode itself, as we rediscover, is biased
under sample averaging, this choice yields the least biased estimator due to a
cancellation we clarify. We further explain why bias in marginal posteriors can
appear relatively large, yet remains correctable, when the number of nuisances
is large. To demonstrate our approach, we present mock analyses in large-scale
structure (LSS) wherein cosmological parameters are subject to large projection
effects (at the 1-2$\sigma$ level) under a flat measure, that are however
recovered at high fidelity ($<0.1\sigma$) when estimated using non-flat
counterparts. Our cosmological analyses are enabled by $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$, a
fast, differentiable pipeline for LSS developed in our companion paper [1].

Abstract: We study the structure and properties of Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) Stars
as alternatives to conventional neutron stars. The work focuses on the
thermodynamic study of gases composed of charged scalar bosons and fermions
(electrons, protons, and neutrons) under a uniform magnetic field, paying
particular attention to the low-temperature limit. Expressions are derived for
the thermodynamic potential, particle densities, energies, anisotropic
pressures, and magnetization, including both statistical and vacuum
contributions, with the latter separated into the contribution from the Lowest
Landau Level (LLL) and excited levels. Based on these results, anisotropic
equations of state (EoS) are constructed that incorporate chemical equilibrium
and charge neutrality conditions for a mixed \textit{npe}+$\pi^-$ gas. These
EoS are then implemented in a system of anisotropic structure equations based
on an axisymmetric metric, allowing for the analysis of how the magnetic field
modifies the structure of BEC stars, including their masses, radii,
deformations, gravitational redshifts, and mass quadrupole moments. Numerical
results are presented showing the influence of the magnetic field on the global
properties of these stars, including potential observable signatures.

TL;DR: 论文研究了核心坍缩超新星（CCSNe）与周围物质（CSM）相互作用产生的射电辐射，特别关注了短周期双星系统中剥离包层恒星的非保守稳定质量转移对CSM形成的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多CCSNe显示出与CSM相互作用的迹象，射电辐射是其中之一。研究旨在理解这些现象背后的物理机制，特别是双星系统中质量转移对CSM形成和射电辐射的影响。

Method: 采用正向建模方法，模拟了SN抛射物与由非保守稳定质量转移形成的CSM之间的相互作用，分析了不同质量恒星对CSM形态和射电辐射的影响。

Result: 低质量剥离恒星形成壳状CSM，高质量恒星形成风状CSM。模型预测的射电辐射在坍缩后数年至数十年内亮度可达$10^{26}$-$10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$，与观测一致。早期数据则显示更复杂的行为。

Conclusion: 非保守稳定质量转移能解释观测到的晚期射电辐射，而早期辐射的复杂性可能与CSM的加速或不对称分布有关。

Abstract: Numerous core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) exhibit signatures of interaction
with circumstellar material (CSM). Bright radio emission years after the SN is
one such indication of dense CSM at large distances from the star, which may be
generated via binary interactions. In this work, we use forward modeling to
study the radio emission produced by interaction between the SN ejecta and CSM
formed by non-conservative stable mass transfer from stripped-envelope stars in
short-period binaries. The donors are among the likely progenitors of
hydrogen-poor CCSNe that significantly expand $10^3$-$10^4$ years before
core-collapse. We identify that non-conservative stable mass transfer from
lower-mass stripped stars can create a detached shell-like CSM, whereas for our
higher-mass stars the CSM is wind-like. In our models, mass transfer rates of
$\sim 10^{-4} M_\odot$ $\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ lead to dense CSM extending to $\sim
10^{18}$ $\mathrm{cm}$. The predicted radio emission is luminous at late times,
reaching $L_{\nu}\sim10^{26}$-$10^{29}$ $\mathrm{erg}$ $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$
$\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$ at years to decades after core-collapse, which is as bright
as late-time radio emission observed for a sample of hydrogen-poor SNe.
However, the light curves of events with early-time data show more complex
behavior in the weeks to months after core-collapse. We qualitatively
demonstrate that similar early-time emission can manifest for CSM that is
accelerated to speeds of $\sim10^3$ $\mathrm{km}$ $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ upon
ejection, as well as for different viewing angles in case of an asymmetric CSM
distribution.

Method: 使用绿岸望远镜（GBT）在2.0 GHz频率下进行为期60天的观测，分析脉冲轮廓和自转速率。

Result: 脉冲轮廓从双峰变为单峰，自转速率减慢；推断出磁星的年龄约为2500年，表面偶极磁场强度约为1 x 10^14 G。

Abstract: We report results from an observational campaign of the radio-loud magnetar
Swift J1818.0-1607 using the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) at 2.0 GHz, which began
in November 2021 during a period of reduced activity approximately 20 months
after its March 2020 outburst. Over the 60-day duration reported here, the
integrated pulse profile remained consistently stable, exhibiting a single,
narrow peak with with a small precursor component and no evidence of a
postcursor one. This pulse profile is in sharp contrast to the double-peaked
morphology observed during an observing campaign approximately 120 days
preceding ours. Along with this change in the integrated pulse profile shape,
we also measure a slower spin-down rate compared to the end of that preceding
campaign. Together, these differences suggest that a mode-switching event
likely occurred between the end of that campaign and the start of ours.
Finally, we derived a phase-connected timing solution from our data, from which
we inferred a characteristic age of approximately 2500 years, about 2.5 times
older than the most recent published estimate, and a surface dipole magnetic
field strength of roughly 1 x 10^14 G, nearly three times weaker. These updated
estimates reflect the short-term variations in the magnetar's spin-down rate,
from which both its age and magnetic field strength are inferred, rather than
intrinsic changes in the magnetar itself.

Motivation: 探讨双星系统中超新星喷出物与伴星的相互作用对光变曲线的影响，特别是Ia型超新星。

Method: 使用Athena++模拟喷出物与白矮星伴星的相互作用，并通过辐射流体力学生成合成光变曲线。

Result: 喷出物形成低密度尾迹，导致前几小时内高亮度辐射，一天后观测亮度比正常Ia型超新星暗15%。

Conclusion: 喷出物与伴星的相互作用显著影响Ia型超新星的光变曲线，尤其在早期阶段。

Abstract: Supernovae in binary star systems involve a hydrodynamical interaction
between the ejecta and a binary companion. This collision results in shock
heating and a modified density structure for the ejecta, both of which affect
the light curve. As highlighted by Kasen, these considerations are particularly
relevant for type Ia supernovae, as the companion is expected to be Roche-lobe
filling at the time of the explosion. We simulate here the interaction between
type Ia supernova ejecta and a white dwarf donor using Athena++, finding the
formation of a low-density wake extending to higher velocities than the
unperturbed ejecta. Radiation hydrodynamics is then used to generate synthetic
light curves for the first day after the explosion for a range of viewing
angles. We find that the hot, high-velocity, shocked ejecta yields $L>10^{40}$
ergs/s over half the sky in the first few hours. The photosphere within the
shock-heated ejecta cools and recedes in velocity space, partially obscuring it
from view, as heating from radioactive nickel becomes increasingly important in
driving the supernova's luminosity. By one day after the explosion, the
luminosity measured by observers looking directly into the wake is dimmer than
that of a normal type Ia supernova by 15 percent due to the modified density
structure.

Conclusion: PWNe可能是银河系高能中微子的重要来源，但需进一步验证。

Abstract: We report on our finding of an excess of $54^{+16}_{-15}$ neutrinos at the
location of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) G63.7+1.1. By analyzing the IceCube
track-like neutrino data for a group of 14 PWNe, which are selected as the
targets because of their reportedly association with molecular clouds,
G63.7+1.1 is found to be the only one detected with neutrino emission and the
post-trail significance for the detection is 3.2$\sigma$. Previously, this PWN
was estimated to have an age of $\gtrsim$8\,kyr, contain a candidate pulsar
detected in X-rays, and have a distance of $\sim$6\,kpc. More importantly and
related to the PWN's possible neutrino emission, surrounding molecular
materials are seen to interact with the PWN. On the basis of these properties,
we examine the proton-proton interactions as the process for the neutrino
production. The PWN (or the pulsar) can collectively provide sufficient energy
to power the required high-energy (HE) protons. This possibly first
neutrino-emitting case in our Galaxy, with problems or other possibilities to
be solved or examined, may reveal to us that PWNe are the significant Galactic
HE neutrino sources.

Motivation: 研究英仙座星系团的X射线数据，以理解其内部结构和动力学特征，特别是中心区域的冷却核心和外围的合并扰动系统。

Method: 结合SRG/eROSITA、XMM-Newton和Chandra的X射线数据，对英仙座星系团进行全面覆盖分析。

Result: 发现IC310是正在与英仙座星系团合并的子星系团的主星系，而NGC1265则是一个高速运动的射电星系。两者的无线电尾形状可能与它们的轨道动力学有关。

Conclusion: 英仙座星系团的结构和动力学特征为研究星系团合并和轨道动力学提供了重要案例。

Abstract: The Perseus cluster (Abell 426) is a nearby massive galaxy cluster that spans
several degrees. We combined SRG/eROSITA, XMM-Newton, and Chandra data to get a
complete coverage of this cluster in X-rays up to $R_{\rm 200c}$ and beyond,
although at the largest radii, spatial non-uniformities of X-ray background and
foreground dominate. While the Perseus central part represents a canonical
cool-core structure with clear signs of AGN Feedback, the outskirts, in turn,
serve as a convincing example of a merger-perturbed system. X-ray data suggest
that IC310 is the main galaxy of a subcluster that merges with Perseus over the
past $\sim 4\,{\rm Gyr}$. Overall, this configuration resembles the merger
between the Coma cluster and the NGC4839 group. It is statistically more likely
to find a merging group near the apocenter of its orbit. Therefore, it is not
surprising that IC310 in Perseus has a relatively small velocity relative to
the main cluster, similarly to NGC4839 in Coma.
  Perseus also hosts a high-velocity radio galaxy, NGC1265 (line-of-sight
velocity is almost twice the virial velocity of the main cluster), which is
known for its spectacular radio tail. Unless this galaxy has been accelerated
by a time-variable potential associated with the merger, it has to move almost
along the line of sight through the entire cluster, which would be a rare, but
not a truly exceptional configuration. Both galaxies, IC310 and NGC1265, have
remarkable radio tails with sharp bends that are reminiscent of a "snake biting
its tail". We speculate that these curious shapes are natural consequences of
their (different) orbits in Perseus. For IC310, the proximity to the apocenter
and the reversal of its radial velocity might play a role. For NGC1265, the
nearly line-of-sight motion coupled with the gas motions in the merging system
might be important.

Conclusion: 黑洞参数在多数系统中未表现出显著偏离，但GRS 1915+105可能暗示了与Kerr度规的潜在偏差。

Abstract: This paper investigates the influence of the dimensionless electric charge
($Q/M$), magnetic charge ($P/M$), and Taub-NUT parameter ($n/M$) of a dyonic
Kerr-Newman-Kasuya-Taub-NUT black hole on quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs)
observed in X-ray binaries. Using the relativistic precession model, we
calculate the three fundamental frequencies arising from particle motion in the
accretion disk around the black hole. These theoretical predictions are then
confronted with observational QPO data from five X-ray binaries (GRO J1655-40,
XTE J1859$+$226, XTE J1550-564, GRS 1915$+$105, and H1743-322), and the Markov
Chain Monte Carlo technique is used to constrain the black hole parameters. Our
analysis reveals no significant evidence for nonzero values of $Q/M$ and $P/M$
across all sources, thereby allowing us to place several stringent upper limits
on electric charge ($Q/M$) and magnetic charge ($P/M$) of the black hole in
these systems. Similarly, no compelling indication of a nonzero Taub-NUT
parameter is found in QPOs from GRO J1655-40, XTE J1859$+$226, XTE J1550-564,
and H1743-322. In contrast, the posterior distribution derived from GRS
1915$+$105 data suggests a nonzero Taub-NUT parameter, i.e., gravitomagnetic
monopole moment. This result indicates a potential deviation from the Kerr
metric in this astrophysical black hole.

Motivation: 研究blazar OP 313在爆发状态下的流量和光谱变化特性，以探索其物理机制。

Method: 使用BVRI光测数据，结合Power Enhanced F-test和Nested ANOVA测试，分析IDV和STV，并拟合光学SED。

Result: 发现IDV在R波段出现5次，变化幅度超过2星等；光谱指数为1.471±0.004，且表现出BWB趋势。

Conclusion: OP 313的光谱行为类似于BL Lac天体，可能与发射区域的物理机制有关。

Abstract: We present the analysis results of flux and spectral variability of the
blazar OP 313 across intra-night to short-term timescales using BVRI
photometric data, gathered over 25 nights from Nov 2024 to May 2025, using two
optical telescopes in ARIES, India. The source was in an outburst state during
this period. We searched for intraday variations (IDV), using two powerful
statistical tests: the Power Enhanced F-test and the Nested ANOVA test. The
source displayed IDV in the R band for five of the ten nights, yielding a duty
cycle of 34$\%$. During the entire monitoring of the source, it showed
variations of over two mag in all B, V, R, and I data bands. We obtained a
variability timescale for a variable light curve, giving us an upper limit for
the size of the emission region. We generated optical SEDs of the blazar for
these 25 nights, fitted a power law of form $(F_\nu \propto \nu^{-\alpha_{o}})$
and found the weighted mean spectral index to be 1.471$\pm$0.004. An analysis
of the color-magnitude diagram shows that, contrary to the redder-when-brighter
(RWB) trend typically observed in FSRQs, this source exhibits a
bluer-when-brighter (BWB) trend on short-term variability (STV) timescales - a
behavior more commonly associated with BL Lac object. We explore potential
physical mechanisms responsible for the observed spectral variability.

Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to exhibit stochastic variability
across a wide range of timescales and wavelengths. AGN flares are extreme
outbursts that deviate from this typical behavior and may trace a range of
energetic physical processes. Using six years of data from Zwicky Transient
Facility (ZTF) Data Release 23, we conduct a systematic search for AGN flares
among a sample of well-sampled AGNs and AGN candidates. We construct two
catalogs: the AGN Flare Coarse Catalog (AGNFCC), containing 28,504 flares
identified via Bayesian blocks and Gaussian Processes, and the AGN Flare
Refined Catalog (AGNFRC), comprising 1,984 high-confidence flares selected
using stricter criteria. We analyze their spatial distribution, temporal
characteristics, host AGN type and potential origins. Some flares can be
associated with known supernovae, tidal disruption events, or blazars, and a
few may be linked to binary black hole mergers or microlensing events. These
catalogs provide a valuable resource for studying transient phenomena in AGNs
and are publicly available at https://github.com/Lyle0831/AGN-Flares.

Abstract: Multi-messenger astronomy was galvanized by the detection of gravitational
waves (GWs) from the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 and
electromagnetic (EM) emission from the subsequent kilonova and short gamma ray
burst. Maximizing multi-messenger constraints on these systems requires
combining models of the progenitors and products of BNS mergers within a single
framework in anticipation of future GW and EM detectors. We demonstrate how
combining models of different aspects of the BNS progenitor-merger-remnant
system into a full multi-messenger modeling pipeline reveals insight into
modeling challenges that will need to be addressed in the coming decade of
multi-messenger astronomy. Motivated by GW170817, this combined model relates
the progenitor astrophysics of a BNS population with their GW observability and
localizability, kilonova light curves, gamma-ray burst afterglow flux, and
kilonova remnant evolution. We find joint correlations between the GW and EM
observables that depend on a complicated interplay between modeling assumptions
and theoretical uncertainties. Next generation detectors will generically
provide multi-messenger constraints on BNSs with median GW network
signal-to-noise ratio $\approx 10$, median of the 90$^{\rm th}$ percentile sky
area $\approx 10$ sq. deg., and kilonova $i$-band apparent magnitudes ranging
from $\approx 33$ to $23$. We find no more than 4\% of the BNSs are
simultaneously detectable by a network of two Cosmic Explorers and one Einstein
Telescope and by the Roman and Rubin telescopes for 55 and 180 sec. exposures
in a $K$-like band and $i$ and $g$ bands, respectively. We discuss key modeling
assumptions that will be transmitted as multi-messenger systematics in the
analysis of future datasets, such as uncertain astrophysical processes of
binary populations and the nuclear equation of state for tests of nuclear
physics and dark matter.

Method: 通过建模无线电观测约束环双星介质（CBM），并进行3D流体动力学模拟，预测X射线特征。

Result: CBM密度较低，爆发能量和喷射物质量影响X射线演化，呈现三个阶段：早期、中期和晚期。

Conclusion: T CrB的X射线演化与RS Oph和V745 Sco类似，但软X射线阶段更长，反映了CBM密度较低和独特的喷射物-环境相互作用。

Abstract: T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) is a symbiotic recurrent nova with eruptions in
1866 and 1946. Mounting evidence suggests an imminent outburst, offering a rare
opportunity to observe a nearby nova in detail. We constrain the circumbinary
medium (CBM) by modeling inter-eruption radio observations and simulate the
hydrodynamic evolution of the upcoming outburst to predict its X-ray
signatures, focusing on the roles of the red giant companion, accretion disk,
and equatorial density enhancement (EDE). We model thermal radio emission from
a CBM composed of a spherical wind and a torus-like EDE to estimate its
density. We then perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the nova outburst,
varying explosion energy, ejecta mass, and CBM configuration. From these, we
synthesize X-ray light curves and spectra as they would appear to XMM-Newton
and XRISM. The CBM in T CrB is significantly less dense than in other symbiotic
novae, with a mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} \approx 4 \times 10^{-9}$ M$_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$ for a 10 km s$^{-1}$ wind. Despite the low-density EDE, the blast is
collimated along the poles by the accretion disk and EDE, producing a bipolar
shock. The red giant partially shields the ejecta, forming a bow shock and hot
wake. X-ray evolution proceeds through three phases: an early phase (first few
hours) dominated by shocked disk material; an intermediate phase ($\sim 1$
week-1 month) driven by reverse-shocked ejecta; and a late phase dominated by
shocked EDE. Soft X-rays trace shocked ejecta, hard X-rays arise from shocked
ambient gas, and synthetic spectra show asymmetric, blueshifted lines due to
absorption by expanding ejecta. The X-ray evolution resembles that of RS Oph
and V745 Sco, with a peak luminosity of $L_\mathrm{X} \approx 10^{36}$ erg
s$^{-1}$, but features a more prolonged soft X-ray phase, reflecting the lower
CBM density and distinct ejecta-environment interaction.

Method: 通过数值计算模拟爆炸，分析其光变曲线和膨胀速度，探讨低抛射质量与磁星模型的可能性。

Result: 低抛射质量（~2 Msun）和中等爆炸能量（~2e51 erg）能部分解释数据，但需要大量镍（0.85 Msun）。磁星模型（3 ms周期，28e14 G磁场）更匹配数据。

Conclusion: 磁星模型更适用于解释SN 2025kg的高光度，其与SN 2023pel的相似性进一步支持了这一结论。

Abstract: Supernovae (SNe) associated with X-Ray Flashes (XRFs) are extremely rare.
Therefore, the discovery of each new object in this class offers a unique
opportunity to improve our understanding about their origins and potential
connection with other high-energy phenomena. SN 2025kg is one of the most
recent events discovered in this category, and exhibits a double-peaked light
curve, with an initial cooling phase followed by the main peak. Here, we
investigate the possible mechanisms powering its bolometric light curve and
expansion velocities, using numerical calculations to simulate the explosion.
We found that low ejecta masses (Mej ~ 2 Msun) and moderate explosion energies
(E ~ 2e51 erg) are required to reproduce the data. Our models also show that a
large amount of nickel (M_Ni = 0.85 Msun) is needed to achieve the high
luminosity of SN 2025kg, which makes this scenario difficult to sustain. As an
alternative, we explore a model in which a millisecond magnetar serves as the
primary energy source. A magnetar with a spin period of 3 ms, approximately,
and a magnetic field of 28e14 G gives an adequate match to the data. To account
for the early cooling phase, we assume the presence of a dense circumstellar
material surrounding the progenitor, with a mass of 0.27 Msun and an extension
of 500 Rsun. A comparison and modeling of a select group of SNe--SN 2006aj, SN
2020bvc and SN 2023pel--is also presented. A remarkable similarity emerges
between SN 2025kg and SN 2023pel. As SN 2023pel was recently proposed to be
powered by a magnetar, this further supports the magnetar scenario for SN
2025kg.

Abstract: Relativistic leptons in galaxy clusters lose their energy via radiation
(synchrotron and inverse Compton losses) and interactions with the ambient
plasma. At z~0, pure radiative losses limit the lifetime of electrons emitting
at ~GHz frequencies to t<100 Myr. Adiabatic losses can further lower Lorentz
factors of electrons trapped in an expanding medium. If the propagation speed
of electrons relative to the ambient weakly magnetized (plasma $\beta\sim10^2$)
Intracluster Medium (ICM) is limited by the Alfv\'en speed,
$v_{a,ICM}=c_{s,ICM}/\beta^{1/2}\sim 10^7\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$, GHz-emitting
electrons can travel only $l \sim v_{a,ICM}t_r\sim 10\,kpc$ relative to the
underlying plasma. Yet, elongated structures spanning hundreds of kpc or even a
few Mpc are observed, requiring either a re-acceleration mechanism or another
form of synchronization, e.g., by a large-scale shock. We argue that filaments
with ordered magnetic fields supported by non-thermal pressure have $v_{a}\gg
v_{a,{\rm ICM}}$ and so can provide such a synchronization even without
re-acceleration or shocks. In particular, along quasi-stationary filaments,
electrons can propagate without experiencing adiabatic losses, and their
velocity is not limited by the Alfv\'en or sound speeds of the ambient thermal
plasma. This model predicts that along filaments that span significant pressure
gradients, e.g., in the cores of galaxy clusters, the synchrotron break
frequency $\nu_b\propto B$ should scale with the ambient gas pressure as
$P^{1/2}$, and the emission from such filaments should be strongly polarized.
While some of these structures can be observed as "filaments", i.e., long and
narrow bright structures, others can be unresolved and have a collective
appearance of a diffuse structure, or be too faint to be detected, while still
providing channels for electrons' propagation.

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of mirror dark matter (DM) on the global
properties of rotating neutron stars (NSs) across evolutionary stages, from
hot, lepton-rich proto-neutron stars (PNSs) to cold, catalyzed NSs along the
Kelvin--Helmholtz timescale. The baryonic matter (BM) is modeled using a
relativistic mean-field (RMF) approach with density-dependent couplings, while
the dark sector mirrors the visible sector with analogous thermodynamic
conditions. Using a two-fluid formalism with purely gravitational DM-BM
interaction, we find that rotation enlarges the star, whereas DM admixture
increases compactness and enhances gravitational stability. However, increased
compactness due to DM lowers the threshold for rotational instabilities, making
DM-admixed stars more susceptible. Rotation decreases temperature profiles by
redistributing thermal energy over a larger volume and reducing central
density, while DM raises temperatures by deepening the gravitational potential
and increasing thermal energy. Stars become more prone to collapse and
rotational instabilities as frequency ($\nu$) rises and the polar-to-equatorial
radius ratio ($r_p/r_e$) decreases, especially near the Keplerian limit
($\nu_K$). DM-admixed stars also show higher surface gravitational redshifts
due to their compactness. Our results qualitatively agree with universal
relations primarily derived for rotating cold stars. These findings highlight
competing effects of rotation and DM on NS thermal evolution, structure, and
observables, potentially offering indirect probes of DM within NSs.

Abstract: This paper investigates the symmetry and magnetic field properties of the
jets in the radio galaxy NGC 1052, with particular attention to the impact of
the ionized torus that surrounds the central region on the emitted radiation.
Our study is based on three new 43 GHz Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)
observations and one 86 GHz observation conducted between April 2021 and April
2022. We derive key jet parameters, such as speed, width, and flux density for
both jets at the two frequencies and compare them with those obtained from
previous VLBI campaigns. Additionally, we present the first (43-86) GHz
spectral index image of NGC 1052, which is crucial to assess the role of the
torus at high frequencies. Finally, we leverage the derived observational
parameters to constrain the magnetic field strength and configuration in the
launched jets. We observe variability in the jet morphology at 43 GHz across
the three epochs, which can be associated with the propagation of jet knots
launched from the nuclear region. The stacked 43 GHz image reveals that the
western and receding jet is approximately three times fainter than its eastern
(approaching) counterpart in the sub-mas region. This asymmetry, together with
the (43-86) GHz spectral index map, suggests that free-free absorption may
affect the 43 GHz emission. On the contrary, the jets appear highly symmetric
at 86 GHz. From the stacked images at 43 GHz and 86 GHz, we extract the jet
width, which is consistent with previous VLBI studies and supports the presence
of a parabolic jet profile on very compact scales. Overall, our results suggest
that the jets are intrinsically launched symmetrically, and that the observed
time-dependent asymmetries may result from free-free absorption by the torus
and the downstream propagation of jet components, a scenario supported by
previous theoretical studies.

Abstract: Despite their discovery fifteen years ago, the nature and origin of the Fermi
bubbles remain unclear. We here investigate the effect a magnetic field can
have on a subsonic breeze outflow emanating from the Galactic centre region.
The presence of this magnetic field allows anisotropic diffusion of cosmic rays
within the outflow, shaping the resultant cosmic ray distribution obtained out
at large distances within the Galactic halo. We show that our
magnetohydrodynamic Galactic breeze model, in combination with an opening angle
for the injection of cosmic rays, leads to $\gamma$-ray emission from the Fermi
bubble region with relatively sharp edges.

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid-mass window are compelling dark
matter candidates, made plausible by the existence of black holes and by the
variety of mechanisms of their production in the early universe. If a PBH falls
into a white dwarf (WD), the strong tidal forces can generate enough heat to
trigger a thermonuclear runaway explosion, depending on the WD mass and the PBH
orbital parameters. In this work, we investigate the WD explosion triggered by
the passage of PBH. We perform 2D simulations of the WD undergoing
thermonuclear explosion in this scenario, with the predicted ignition site as
the parameter assuming the deflagration-detonation transition model. We study
the explosion dynamics and predict the associated light curves and
nucleosynthesis. We find that the model sequence predicts the light curves
which align with the Phillip's relation ($B_{\max}$ vs. $\Delta M_{15}$). Our
models hint at a unifying approach in triggering Type Ia supernovae without
involving two distinctive evolutionary tracks.

Abstract: Chemical abundance measurements from stars in the Milky Way to the
intragalactic medium in the Perseus Cluster have challenged the spherical
explosion models. Models in the literature cannot closely match the observed
element ratios, where Si, S are overproduced and Ar, Ca are underproduced. In
this article, we explore the impact of the model parameters during the
evolution of massive stars on the final explosive nucleosynthesis. We
investigate the effects of a parametrized model of the convective process,
including the mixing length parameter and the semi-convection parameter, on the
production of Si-group elements. We search for the value pair that can reduce
the discrepancy in the models. We conclude that a mixing length parameter of
2.2 and semi-convection parameter of 0.03 are required to fit these criteria.
Using this updated value pair, we compute a sequence of massive star models
from $M_{\rm ZAMS} = $ 15 -- 40 $M_{\odot}$. The high resolution data from
future observations such as XRISM will provide further details on less
constrained processes in stellar evolution and supernova explosion. Future
comparison with supernova models of various progenitor metallicity will further
shed light on the supernova population and their relative rates on cosmological
scales.

Motivation: 需要解释银河系中能量超过1 PeV的宇宙射线来源，挑战现有银河CR加速机制。

Method: 通过分析超吸积X射线双星的动力学特性，证明其喷射流或风能加速质子至PeV以上能量。

Conclusion: 超吸积X射线双星是银河系中超PeV宇宙射线的潜在来源，未来可通过γ射线观测验证。

Abstract: The extension of the cosmic-ray (CR) spectrum well beyond 1~PeV necessitates
the existence of a population of accelerators in the Milky Way, which we refer
to as Super PeVatrons. Identifying the nature of these sources remains a
challenge to the paradigm of galactic CRs. Galactic super-accreting X-ray
binaries, where the compact object accretes at a rate near or above the
Eddington limit, can meet the energy requirement to supply the high-energy
population of galactic CRs. We demonstrate that the trans-relativistic jets
and/or winds of these powerful objects with kinetic energy luminosity exceeding
$10^{39} \, \rm erg/s$, can accelerate protons to energies above several PeV.
Detection of such super-accreting X-ray binaries through their
ultra-high-energy $\gamma$-ray ``halos" and large-scale nebulae is also
discussed.

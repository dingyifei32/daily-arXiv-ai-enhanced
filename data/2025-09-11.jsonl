In particular, photometric\nredshift (photo-z) errors and intrinsic alignments (IA) must be robustly\naccounted for to ensure accurate inference of cosmological parameters. The\nincreasing depth of Stage IV surveys exacerbates these challenges by producing\nlow signal-to-noise galaxy populations prone to inaccurate photo-z\nmeasurements. Catastrophically misidentified redshifts are especially\nproblematic for 3$\\times$2pt inferences that combine weak lensing and galaxy\nclustering information. We demonstrate that even modest outlier fractions (e.g.\n5%) can lead to substantial biases in cosmological parameter estimates: up to\n1.8${\\sigma}$ in ${\\Omega}_M$ and ${\\sigma}_8$, and over 8${\\sigma}$ in the IA\nredshift evolution parameter ${\\eta}$. To address this, we introduce a flexible\nweighting scheme at the likelihood level that down-weights the most\ncontamination-sensitive elements of the data vector during inference. This\nmethod mitigates biases without inflating the parameter space, reducing\ncosmological parameter biases to below 1${\\sigma}$ without substantially\ndegrading constraining power.

Despite their relevance, relativistic imprints in\nthe distribution of galaxies on large scales have so far eluded detection,\nmainly because they are stronger on the largest cosmic scales, which are\nplagued by cosmic variance. Expanding on previous works, we study galaxy\nclustering by subdividing a galaxy population into two sub-samples -- bright\nand faint -- and we here focus on their two-point correlation function in\nharmonic space, i.e. via the angular power spectrum. Thanks to such a split in\nmagnitude and by exploiting the multi-tracer technique, we are able to boost\nthe impact of the relativistic contributions. We first focus on the leading\nrelativistic contribution given by the Doppler effect and show that, with a\ncarefully tailored luminosity cut, it can be detected.

We then fit\nthe Planck number counts to both cosmologies, only varying the hydrostatic mass\nbias, and find required biases of $0.790 \\pm 0.070$ and $0.630 \\pm 0.034$ for\nSPT and eROSITA respectively, instead of the $0.844^{+0.055}_{-0.062}$ derived\nin Aymerich et al. (2025). Lastly, we compute the expected t-SZ power spectrum\nobtained from the SPT and eROSITA cosmologies, and compare these to the Planck\nmeasurement. While the predicted SPT angular power spectrum is in good\nagreement with the Planck measurements, the normalisation of the predicted\neROSITA angular power spectrum is two times higher at all scales. These two\ntests highlight the power of comparing predicted cluster abundances and t-SZ\npower spectra to measured data in a physically interpretable way."}

Here\nwe use the results of the recent LHAASO observation of gamma rays from a region\nof $\\sim 2$ degrees around the Cassiopeia A (Cas A) supernova remnant to\nconstrain the process of particle escape from this remnant. We dedicate special\nattention to discuss the impact of shock evolution and particle propagation in\nthe near source region on the gamma ray emission. This is very important to\nassess the possibility that very high-energy protons may have been accelerated\nin past activity of Cas A. Given the core collapse nature of Cas A and its\nyoung age ($\\sim 340$ years), the non detection of $\\gtrsim 100$ TeV gamma rays\nfrom this remnant allows us to draw some conclusions on the role of supernova\nexplosions for the origin of cosmic rays at the knee. In particular we\ncalculate the spectrum of cosmic rays that may have escaped this remnant to\nmake a clear distinction between the instantaneous maximum energy and the one\nthat appears as a flux suppression in the time integrated spectrum from an\nindividual supernova. LHAASO observation of the region around Cas A as well as\ngamma ray observations of the remnant itself confirm that this remnant is not\noperating as a PeVatron and that, although in the early stages the maximum\nenergy may have reached $\\sim$Peta-electronVolt, the number of such particles\nin the surroundings of Cas A is exceedingly small."}

For a $U(1)$-gauge inflationary model, the IA power spectrum is\nproportional to the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation, $P_\\zeta(k)\n\\propto k^{-3}$. However, the proportionality constants contain not only the\nPNG amplitude but also undetermined EFT bias parameters.

Using these\nbias parameters, we forecast IA's constraining power, assuming data from the\nDark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Rubin Observatory Legacy\nSurvey of Space and Time (LSST). We find that the IA power spectrum can improve\nthe current limits on the amplitude of parity-violating PNG derived from galaxy\nfour-point correlation and CMB trispectrum analyses.

The\nplethora of X-ray observatories currently operational enables a panchromatic\nview of the high-energy emission of celestial sources. However, uncertainties\nin the energy-dependent calibration of the instrument transfer functions (e.g.\nthe effective area, energy redistribution, or gain) can limit - and\nhistorically, did limit - the accuracy of X-ray spectroscopic measurements.\n  We revised the status of the cross-calibration among the scientific payload\non board four operation missions: Chandra, NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, and the recently\nlaunched XRISM. XRISM carries the micro-calorimeter Resolve, which yields the\nbest energy resolution at energies above 2 keV. For this purpose, we used the\ndata from a 10-day-long observational campaign targeting the nearby active\ngalactic nucleus NGC 3783, carried out in July 2024.\n  We present a novel model-independent method for assessing the\ncross-calibration status that is based on a multi-node spline of the spectra\nwith the highest-resolving power (XRISM/Resolve in our campaign). We also\nestimated the impact of the intrinsic variability of NGC 3783 on the\ncross-calibration status due to the different time coverages of participating\nobservatories and performed an empirical reassessment of the Resolve throughput\nat low energies.\n  Based on this analysis, we derived a set of energy-dependent correction\nfactors of the observed responses, enabling a statistically robust analysis of\nthe whole spectral dataset.

Model-II preserves the classical temporal\ncomponent while altering only spatial geometry, maintaining constant stagnation\npoints and stable cavity structures throughout the parameter range.

An extensive multi-instrument campaign\nfeaturing MAGIC, VERITAS, and \\textit{NuSTAR} provided comprehensive\nvery-high-energy (VHE; $E > 100$\\,GeV) and X-ray coverage over nine consecutive\ndays. In this work, we perform a detailed spectral analysis of the X-ray and\nVHE emissions on sub-hour timescales throughout the flare. We identify several\nclockwise spectral hysteresis loops in the X-rays, revealing a spectral\nevolution more complex than a simple harder-when-brighter trend. The VHE\nspectrum extends beyond 10\\,TeV, and its temporal evolution closely mirrors the\nbehavior in the X-rays. We report the first evidence of VHE spectral hysteresis\noccurring simultaneously with the X-ray loops. To interpret these findings, we\napply a time-dependent leptonic model to 240 broadband spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) binned on a 15-minute scale, allowing us to\nself-consistently track the particle distribution's history. Our modeling shows\nthat the majority of the sub-hour flux and spectral variations are driven by\nchanges in the luminosity and slope of the injected electron distribution. The\nrequired variations in the electron slope are difficult to reconcile with\nmagnetic reconnection but are consistent with a shock-acceleration scenario\nwhere the shock compression ratio evolves by a factor of $\\sim2$. The model\nalso points to a relatively stable magnetic field and emitting region size,\nfavoring a scenario where the emission originates from a stationary feature in\nthe jet, such as a recollimation shock. However, this scenario requires a jet\nLorentz factor that significantly exceeds values from VLBI measurements to\naccount for the high minimum electron energy implied by the lack of variability\nin the optical band."}

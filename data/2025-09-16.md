TL;DR: 超过基础温度的黑洞吸积模拟显示了具有强大外流和低放射效率的粗短碳碳相对论磁流体动力学特征，为超明亮X射线源等天体提供了理论基础


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究超基础温度黑洞吸积流的动力学特征和观测表征，以理解超明亮X射线源、小红点等天体环境

Method: 使用相对论磁流体动力学方程组合角度离散化放射传输方法，模拟不同吸积率、黑洞自旋和磁场配置

Result: 超基础温度吸积流形成粗短碳碳相对论磁流体动力学碳相，产生强劲外流，放射效率极低，角动量主要通过麦克斯韦应力传递，形成强弱两种发射模式

Conclusion: 超基础温度黑洞吸积模型具有普遍适用性，能够解释多种天体环境的观测现象，为高吸积率黑洞系统提供了重要的理论基础

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of super-Eddington black hole accretion
simulations that solve the GRMHD equations coupled with angle-discretized
radiation transport. The simulations span a range of accretion rates, two black
hole spins, and two magnetic field topologies, and include resolution studies
as well as comparisons with non-radiative models. Super-Eddington accretion
flows consistently develop geometrically thick disks supported by radiation
pressure, regardless of magnetic field configuration. Radiation generated in
the inner disk drives substantial outflows, forming conical funnel regions that
limit photon escape and result in very low radiation efficiency. The accretion
flows are highly turbulent with thermal energy transport dominated by radiation
advection rather than diffusion. Angular momentum is primarily carried outward
by Maxwell stress, with turbulent Reynolds stress playing a subdominant role.
Both strong and weak jets are produced. Strong jets arise from sufficient net
vertical magnetic flux and rapid black hole spin and can effectively evacuate
the funnel, enabling radiation to escape through strong geometric beaming. In
contrast, weak jets fail to clear the funnel, which becomes obscured by
radiation-driven outflows and leads to distinct observational signatures.
Spiral structures are observed in the plunging region, behaving like density
waves. These super-Eddington models are applicable to a variety of astronomical
systems, including ultraluminous X-ray sources, little red dots, and black hole
transients.

TL;DR: 提出超新星潮汐瓦解（TDS）模型解释高能核瞬变现象，比传统TDE更亮且不受黑洞质量限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越来越多的模糊核瞬变现象（包括极端核瞬变）无法用传统潮汐瓦解事件（TDE）解释，特别是对于高能量和超大质量黑洞的情况

Method: 通过流体动力学模拟研究超新星被超大质量黑洞潮汐瓦解的过程，分析吸积盘形成和吸积率变化

Result: TDS吸积率呈现缓慢下降趋势，可持续数月到数十年。对于M_BH ≲ 10^7.5 M⊙的黑洞，峰值吸积率可超过爱丁顿极限；对于更大质量黑洞则保持亚爱丁顿水平

Conclusion: 该模型为在M_BH ≳ 10^8 M⊙星系中触发能量≥10^45 erg/s的TDE-like耀斑或开启变化外观活动星系核提供了机制

Abstract: An increasing number of ambiguous nuclear transients, including some extreme
nuclear transients, have been reported, which cannot be simply explained by the
tidal disruption event (TDE) due to their high energy and/or overmassive black
holes. Stars that form in or are captured by AGN disks will grow and migrate
inward, potentially exploding as supernovae once the inner cold accretion disk
disappears during the phase of AGN decay. We propose that tidal disruption of a
supernova (TDS) by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) can produce nuclear
transients that are even more luminous than typical TDEs and are not limited by
the SMBH mass. In this scenario, the SMBH can capture the supernova ejecta,
which subsequently self-intersects and circularizes into an accretion disk.
Based on hydrodynamical simulations, we find that the accretion rate of the TDS
disk exhibits a slow decline that can last for months to decades. The peak
accretion rate of a typical core-collapse SN scenario can exceed the Eddington
limit for SMBHs with $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{7.5}\,M_\odot$, while it remains
sub-Eddington for more massive SMBHs. This model provides a mechanism for
triggering an energetic TDE-like flare with luminosity
\(\gtrsim10^{45}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}\) in galaxies with $M_{\rm
BH}\gtrsim10^{8}\,M_\odot$ or triggering turn-on changing-look AGNs.

### [3] [Probing Hernquist dark matter with black hole shadows: A comprehensive study of various accretions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11245)
*Yuxuan Shi,Hongbo Cheng*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 本文研究了施瓦西黑洞被Hernquist暗物质晕包围时的阴影成像特性，分析了三种吸积模型（薄盘吸积、静态球对称吸积和下落球对称吸积）对黑洞阴影观测的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑洞阴影的观测特征强烈依赖于周围吸积介质的性质，而暗物质晕的存在可能显著影响黑洞阴影的成像特性。本文旨在探索Hernquist暗物质晕对施瓦西黑洞阴影的定量影响。

Method: 采用三种简化吸积模型：几何薄吸积盘、静态球对称吸积和下落球对称吸积。通过数值计算分析Hernquist暗物质晕参数对直接辐射、透镜环和光子环等观测特征的影响。

Result: Hernquist暗物质晕参数显著影响观测强度：薄盘吸积中直接辐射贡献显著；球对称吸积模型中强度随暗物质参数增加而显著降低；下落吸积因多普勒退增强效应产生更暗的阴影图像；光子球尺寸增大约2%-30%。

Conclusion: 黑洞阴影的观测特征可以作为区分超大质量黑洞周围不同暗物质分布的有力探针，Hernquist暗物质晕的存在会显著改变黑洞阴影的成像特性。

Abstract: The appearance of a black hole shadow, in both astronomical observations and
theoretical analysis, depends critically on the properties of the surrounding
accretion. In this study, we analyse the emission and observational properties
of a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a Hernquist dark matter (DM) halo
by considering three simplified accretion models, which have not been
previously explored in such detail. Based on our findings, direct emission
contributes markedly to the whole observed intensity for a
Schwarzschild-Hernquist black hole encircled by a geometrically thin accretion
disk. The corresponding regions and measured intensities of the lensing ring,
the photon ring, and direct emission are sensitive to the parameters of the
Hernquist DM halo. Apart from disk accretion, we also study two spherical
accretion models: static and infalling. With increasing Hernquist DM
parameters, both models exhibit a significant decrease in the measured
intensity, yet the photon spheres are enlarged by an increase of $\sim2\%$ to
$\sim30\%$. Furthermore, Doppler de-boosting due to the infalling accretion
results in darker shadow images compared to static cases. By precising
visualisations of the shadows, our results suggest that the observational
characteristics of black hole shadows can serve as a powerful probe for
distinguishing between different DM distributions around supermassive black
holes.

TL;DR: 使用去趋势波动分析(DFA)研究163个长暴的Hurst指数，发现与持续时间、低能谱指数呈负相关，与峰值光子通量的相关性在短时标最强


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伽马射线暴是宇宙中最强大的天体物理现象，其复杂多变的光变曲线反映了中心引擎动力学，需要定量分析时间相关性来理解物理机制

Method: 对BATSE探测的163个长暴应用去趋势波动分析(DFA)计算Hurst指数，并通过回归和相关分析研究Hurst指数与其他12个观测参数的关系

Result: 发现Hurst指数与暴持续时间(T50, T90)和低能谱指数α呈负相关；与峰值光子通量的相关性在64ms时标最强，在256-1024ms时标系统减弱

Conclusion: 时间相关性的持续性在GRB发射的快速变化成分中最明显，这为理解GRB发射的时间结构及其与底层物理机制的联系提供了新视角

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) rank among the most powerful astrophysical phenomena,
characterized by complex and highly variable prompt emission light curves that
reflect the dynamics of their central engines. In this work, we analyze a
sample of 163 long-duration GRBs detected by the Burst and Transient Source
Experiment (BATSE), applying detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to derive the
Hurst index as a quantitative descriptor of temporal correlations in the light
curves. We further explore statistical correlations between the Hurst index and
12 other observational parameters through regression and correlation analyses.
Our results reveal anti-correlations between the Hurst index and the burst
durations (T50, T90), and a negative trend with the low-energy spectral index
\alpha. We also find that correlations with peak photon flux are strongest at
the shorter timescale (64 ms) and systematically weaken at longer timescales
(256-1024 ms), indicating that the persistence of temporal correlations is most
evident in the rapid variability component of GRB emission. The results offer
new perspectives on the temporal structure of the GRB emission and its
potential link to the underlying physical mechanisms driving these bursts.

### [5] [Angle-dependent hardening of the reprocessed spectra in ULXs powered by accretion onto neutron stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11682)
*Sricheta Karmakar,Alexander A. Mushtukov,Matthew Middleton*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 超临界吸积盘产生辐射驱动外流，影响X射线辐射的角度分布，导致几何束流效应，进而影响X射线脉冲星的视亮度、脉冲探测和光谱组成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究质量吸积率超过约10^19 g/s时，X射线脉冲星中辐射驱动外流对辐射角度分布和光谱特性的影响，特别是几何束流效应对观测特性的作用。

Method: 采用简单的外流几何模型，进行蒙特卡洛模拟，模拟由外流形成的吸积腔壁再处理辐射的光谱，仅考虑再处理辐射而不包括直接脉冲星辐射。

Result: 再处理辐射光谱取决于中心引擎的实际光度、外流几何和视角（尤其是后者），高能部分对视角变化敏感（低倾角时更硬），而软通量随倾角变化相对较小。

Conclusion: 该模型预测可变超亮X射线源应表现出强烈的高能角度敏感性，同时软波段变化相对温和，这自然出现在进动调制有效倾角的情况下。

Abstract: It is anticipated that mass accretion rates exceeding approximately
$10^{19}\,{\rm g\,s^{-1}}$ in X-ray pulsars lead to radiation-driven outflows
from super-critical accretion discs. The outflows launched from the disc
influence the angular distribution of X-ray radiation, resulting in geometrical
beaming. The beaming, in turn, impacts the apparent luminosity of the X-ray
pulsar, detectability of pulsations, and the spectral composition of the X-ray
flux. We employ a straightforward geometrical model of the outflows, perform
Monte Carlo simulations, and model the spectra of radiation, reprocessed by the
walls of the accretion cavity formed by the outflows. We consider the
reprocessed emission only; direct pulsar emission is not included in our
modelling. Our results demonstrate that the spectra of reprocessed radiation
depend on the actual luminosity of the central engine, the geometry of the
outflows, and the viewing angle - most notably on the latter, through changing
visibility of the hotter wall regions near the disc plane. The high-energy part
of the reprocessed spectrum depends strongly on viewing angle (harder at lower
inclinations), while the soft flux varies comparatively little with
inclination. In our model, this contrast is a prediction: variable
ultra-luminous X-ray sources are expected to exhibit strong high-energy angle
sensitivity together with comparatively modest soft-band variation, naturally
arising if precession modulates the effective inclination.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 本文通过种群合成模拟研究不同超新星机制对自透镜双星系统可观测群体的影响，重点关注质量间隙区域（2-5 M☉）的紧凑天体分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自透镜系统为研究银河系紧凑天体群体提供了独特的观测窗口，特别是针对紧凑天体分布中争议性的质量间隙区域，需要理解不同超新星机制对可观测系统的影响。

Method: 使用startrack和COSMIC种群合成代码，测试三种具有不同对流增长时间尺度（f_mix = 0.5, 1.0, 4.0）的超新星遗迹形成模型，模拟银河系盘和核球的自透镜双星系统。

Result: 延迟f_mix=0.5模型预测质量间隙区域的系统比例显著更高（某些巡天中高达10倍），所有模型都强烈偏好低质心速度系统（v_cm≤20 km/s）。ZTF预计能产生数十个覆盖良好的系统，LSST和ZTF在银河系盘中预计能检测到几十个系统。

Conclusion: 自透镜观测有助于约束质量间隙这一争议性群体，不同超新星机制对可观测系统群体有显著影响，低质心速度系统占主导地位，未来巡天有望检测到足够数量的系统进行详细表征。

Abstract: Self-lensing (SL) in binary systems has the potential to provide a unique
observational window into the Galactic population of compact objects. Using the
$\mathtt{startrack}$ and COSMIC population synthesis codes, we investigate how
different supernova mechanisms affect the observable population of SL systems,
with particular attention to the mass gap (2$\mathrm{-}$5 M$_\odot$) in compact
object distributions. We test three supernova remnant formation models with
different convective growth timescales ($f_{\rm mix}$ = 0.5, 1.0, and 4.0),
simulating SL binary systems across the Galactic disk and bulge. We identify
distinct groupings of SL sources based on lens mass and Einstein crossing time,
clearly differentiating neutron star from black hole systems and close from
wide orbits. Notably, the delayed $f_{\rm mix} = 0.5$ model predicts a
significantly higher fraction of systems with lens masses in the mass gap
region (up to $\sim10$ times more for certain surveys), suggesting that SL
observations could help constrain this controversial population. Our analysis
reveals a strong preference for systems with low centre-of-mass velocities
($v_{\rm cm}\leq20$ km/s) across all models, resulting primarily from physical
processes governing compact object formation and binary survival. While many
potential detections will have limited observational coverage, ZTF is predicted
to yield several dozen well-covered systems that should enable detailed
characterization. When applying simple detection criteria including photometric
precision and signal-to-noise requirements, predicted rates decrease by
approximately two orders of magnitude, but still yield up to a few tens of
expected detections for LSST and ZTF in the Galactic disk population.

TL;DR: 研究WIMP暗物质在含Δ超子中子星中的吸积效应，发现暗物质会软化状态方程，降低星体最大质量、半径、潮汐形变能力和转动惯量，但增加f模频率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中子星的强引力会导致暗物质在其核心积聚，这种积聚会影响中子星的整体性质，需要研究WIMP暗物质对含Δ超子中子星的具体影响。

Method: 研究WIMP暗物质粒子在Δ-混合超子星中的吸积过程，分析其对质量、半径、潮汐形变能力、f模频率和转动惯量等整体性质的影响。

Result: 暗物质的加入软化了状态方程，降低了最大可能质量、典型半径、典型潮汐形变能力和典型星的转动惯量，但增加了典型星的f模频率。发现暗物质费米动量与典型星整体性质之间存在立方相关性。

Conclusion: 暗物质吸积显著影响中子星的整体性质，特别是通过软化状态方程来改变星体的结构参数，这些发现对理解暗物质与致密天体的相互作用具有重要意义。

Abstract: The strong gravitational pull of the neutron star leads to the accretion of
dark matter (DM) inside the core of the neutron star. The accretion of DM
affects the bulk properties of the neutron star. Here, we study how the
accretion of WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) dark matter particles
affects the $\Delta-$admixed hyperon star's bulk properties specifically mass,
radius, tidal deformability, $f-$mode frequency and moment of inertia. The
inclusion of dark matter softens the EOS (equation of state) and reduces the
maximum possible mass, canonical radius, canonical tidal deformability, and
moment of inertia of canonical star. However, the $f-$mode frequency of the
canonical star increases. We find a cubical correlation between the dark matter
fermi momenta $k_f^{DM}$ and bulk properties of canonical star.

TL;DR: 首次对513个费米亮BL Lac天体构建平均态SED，发现非爆发态磁场较弱、辐射区较大，并量化了Klein-Nishina抑制条件和粒子加速机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 耀变体在爆发状态下被广泛研究，但非爆发态占据其大部分寿命，其普遍性质很少被讨论，需要系统研究平均态特性。

Method: 使用存档数据和物理确定的SED处理方法，为513个费米亮BL Lac天体构建近似平均态SED，分析磁场强度、辐射区大小等参数。

Result: 平均态磁场比爆发态弱近一个数量级，辐射区更大；发现359个源存在Klein-Nishina抑制；能量依赖概率加速机制可能主导粒子加速。

Conclusion: BL Lac天体在平均态下辐射区更扩展且磁化较弱，Klein-Nishina效应显著影响逆康普顿散射，EDPA机制可能是主要的粒子加速机制。

Abstract: The physics-determined broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of
blazars have been widely used to study the property during their
flaring/outburst states, while the non-flaring state takes up most of their
lifetime and the general property of blazars has been barely discussed. In this
work, for the first time, we used the archival data and employed the
physics-determined SED processing method to form approximately average-state
SEDs for 513 \textit{Fermi} bright BL Lacs. In general, we found that the
magnetic field ($B$) is weaker than those obtained for flaring/outburst state
by nearly one order of magnitude, and the dissipation region size ($R$) is
larger than those obtained for flaring/outburst state, suggesting that the
dissipation region could be more extend and less magnetized. A correlation
between the synchrotron-self Compton (SSC) peak frequency ($\log \nu_{\rm
ssc}$) against the synchrotron peak frequency ($\log \nu_{\rm sy}$) suggest
that the inverse Compton scattering of HBLs suffer a significant Klein-Nishina
(KN) suppression, we quantified the condition of KN suppression by determining
the critical synchrotron peak frequency ($\nu_{\rm sy}^{\rm c}$) and found 359
out of 513 sources in our sample suffer KN suppression. Furthermore, our
analysis of the relationship between synchrotron curvature ($1/b_{\rm sy}$) and
$\log \nu_{\rm sy}$ indicates that the energy-dependent probability
acceleration (EDPA) mechanism may dominate the particle acceleration in BL Lac
jets.

TL;DR: 对高同步峰耀变体PKS 2155-304的多波段光变和能谱演化研究，发现不同耀发状态下物理参数的系统性变化，表明加速效率和磁化程度的变化驱动了波段依赖性耀发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究耀变体PKS 2155-304的多波段辐射特性和物理机制，通过时间分辨的能谱分析来探究其辐射起源和耀发物理过程。

Method: 利用多波段数据构建光变曲线和能谱分布，使用贝叶斯块分割时间序列，在同步自康普顿框架下建模，采用神经网络代理加速参数推断。

Result: 发现不同耀发状态下物理参数的显著变化：多波段耀发时磁场、电子光度、最大洛伦兹因子和多普勒因子显著不同；γ射线耀发时电子谱指数更硬；X射线耀发时磁场和最大洛伦兹因子更高；光学/紫外耀发时多个参数变化但发射区大小基本不变。

Conclusion: 喷流功率以电子为主，磁化程度在X射线耀发时升高，加速效率和磁化程度的变化是驱动PKS 2155-304波段依赖性耀发的主要机制。

Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of the temporal and spectral evolution of
the emission from the blazar PKS 2155-304, a high-synchrotron-peaked (HSP)
blazar. Using $\gamma$-ray, X-ray, optical/UV, and infrared data assembled from
the Markarian Multiwavelength Data Center, we constructed multi-band light
curves and temporally resolved spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of PKS
2155-304 to probe the origin of its emission. The light curves show significant
variability, with fractional variability peaking at 0.75 in X-rays, 0.4 in the
optical/UV, and 0.65 in $\gamma$-ray band-consistent with expectations for
HSPs. Segmenting the $\gamma$-ray light curve with Bayesian blocks, we defined
253 time-resolved epochs with adequate multi-band coverage and categorized them
into quiescent states (QS), multiwavelength flares (MWF), $\gamma$-ray flares
($\gamma$F), X-ray flares (XF), and optical/UV flares (OUF). Each SED is
modeled within a synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) framework that
self-consistently evolves particle injection and cooling; a neural-network
surrogate is used to accelerate parameter inference. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests
reveal state-dependent parameter variations relative to QS: (i) during MWF, the
magnetic field B, electron luminosity $L_{e}$, maximum electron Lorentz factor
$\gamma_{max}$, and Doppler factor $\delta$ differ significantly; (ii) during
$\gamma$F, a harder electron index p is estimated; (iii) XF shows higher B and
$\gamma_{max}$ with a more compact emitting region; and (IV) during OUF,
changes in B, $L_{e}$, $\gamma_{max}$, $\delta$, and p are found while the
emitting-zone size remains approximately constant. The jet power is
electron-dominated (magnetic-to-electron power ratio
$\eta_{B}\simeq0.09-0.17$), with $\eta_{B}$ rising during XF. These results
suggest that variations in acceleration efficiency and magnetization drive
band-dependent flaring in PKS 2155-304.

Abstract: The intensity and energy spectrum of energetic charged radiation in the
heliosphere are significantly influenced by solar activity. This phenomenon is
known as solar modulation of galactic cosmic rays.
  As interplanetary travel becomes a reality, missions in low Earth orbit
become longer and more frequent. In low Earth orbit we need to estimate the
influence of Earth's magnetosphere accurately to assess the radiation hazard
experienced by astronauts during space missions, there is an emergent need for
accurately depicting the space radiation environment and predicting the
cosmic-ray flux in the heliosphere.
  Here we present a new effective and predictive model of solar modulation
which incorporates fundamental physics processes of particle transport such as
diffusion, convection, and adiabatic cooling to compute the energy spectrum;
and temporal evolution of cosmic radiation in the inner heliosphere.
  Empowered by this model and a time-dependent effective description of the
geomagnetic field, we will show our estimates of the dose rates experienced by
astronauts over time, as they orbit Earth onboard the International Space
Station and while travelling through interplanetary space.

Abstract: Understanding the formation and evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes
(BBHs) requires a thorough investigation of the key physical processes
involved. While one pathway involves the isolated evolution of massive binary
stars, affected by uncertain stages like core-collapse supernovae and common
envelope evolution, an alternative channel is dynamical formation in dense
stellar environments. Newtonian gravity has traditionally provided a robust and
computationally efficient framework for modeling large-scale gravitational
interactions. However, accurately capturing close encounters and black hole
mergers necessitates the use of general relativity. This work focuses on
assessing the applicability of post-Newtonian gravity in bridging these
regimes, offering a physically insightful and computationally tractable
approach to modeling BBH formation in the gravitational-wave era of astronomy.

TL;DR: 本研究通过宽频带观测分析脉冲星射电辐射的频率依赖性变化，发现传统单一发射高度模型无法解释观测到的多样性行为，提出脉冲星光束可能来自多个高度的扩展区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索脉冲星射电辐射的频率依赖性变化，评估传统的半径-频率映射模型和扇形光束模型是否能描述观测数据。

Method: 使用704-4032 MHz宽频带观测100多个脉冲星，测量多强度级别的轮廓宽度，拟合高斯分量，利用像差-延迟效应估计发射高度，并与扇形光束模型比较。

Result: 许多脉冲星轮廓随频率增加而变窄，但相当一部分显示相反趋势；高斯分量峰值位置基本不变但宽度变窄；发射高度随频率变化不明确；自转减慢光度与轮廓变窄弱相关但与发射高度无关。

Conclusion: 传统单一发射高度模型无法解释观测多样性，脉冲星光束可能来自多个高度的扩展区域，具有扇形或斑块结构，未来模型需要包含真实等离子体物理和多高度发射机制。

Abstract: Aims. We explore frequency-dependent changes in pulsar radio emission by
analyzing their profile widths and emission heights, assessing whether the
simple radius-to-frequency mapping (RFM) or the fan beam model can describe the
data. Methods. Using wideband (704-4032 MHz) Murriyang (Parkes) observations of
over 100 pulsars, we measured profile widths at multiple intensity levels, fit
Gaussian components, and used aberration-retardation effects to estimate
emission altitudes. We compared trends in width evolution and emission height
with a fan beam model. Results. Similar to other recent studies, we find that
while many pulsars show profiles narrowing with increasing frequency, a
substantial fraction show the reverse. The Gaussian decomposition of the
profiles reveals that the peak locations of the components vary little with
frequency. However, the component widths do, in general, narrow with increasing
frequency. This argues that propagation effects are responsible for the width
evolution of the profiles rather than emission height. Overall, the evolution
of the emission height with frequency is unclear, and clouded by the
assumptions in the model. Spin-down luminosity correlates weakly with profile
narrowing but not with emission height. Conclusions. The classic picture where
pulsars emit at a single emission height which decreases with increasing
observing frequency cannot explain the diversity in behavior observed here.
Instead, pulsar beams likely originate from extended regions at multiple
altitudes, with fan-beam or patchy structures dominating their frequency
evolution. Future models must incorporate realistic plasma physics and
multi-altitude emission to capture the range of pulsar behaviors.

Motivation: 毫米波段臱星观测数据稀缺，而高精度定向微波背景实验(如ACT)虽为宇宙学设计，但具有高重视频次和广泛天区覆盖能力，可用于时域科学研究

Method: 发展了阶段解析地图构建方法，利用信号的知周期性提高敏感度，同时引入基于模板的原始数据时序拟合方法独立验证结果

Result: 在96GHz、148GHz和225GHz获得蝇蝉臱星周期平均流强上限分别为4.6mJy、4.4mJy和20.7mJy，补充了谱能分布短缺

Conclusion: 这些结果表明蝇蝉臱星在毫米波长度不会显著平化或反转，展示了下一代定向微波背景实验在短时标天文现象探索中的潜力

Abstract: Millimeter-wave observations of pulsars, while crucial for understanding
their emission mechanisms, remain scarce. We demonstrate that high-precision
cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments like the Atacama Cosmology
Telescope (ACT), though designed for cosmology, offer a unique capability for
such time-domain science due to their high cadence and broad sky coverage in
millimeter bands. While previous ACT searches have focused on transients
lasting minutes or longer, we develop and validate analysis methods to search
for periodic, millisecond-scale transients, a capability not typically
associated with CMB experiments. We describe a phase-resolved mapmaking
approach, which leverages the known periodicity of the signal to enhance
sensitivity and offers advantages in diagnosing systematic errors. We also
introduce a template-based fit to the raw data timestreams that independently
validate our results. Applying these methods to estimate the millimeter flux of
the Crab Pulsar (PSR B0531+21), we derive 95% confidence upper limits of 4.6
mJy, 4.4 mJy, and 20.7 mJy on the pulsar's period-averaged flux density at 96
GHz, 148 GHz, and 225 GHz, respectively. These constraints fill a gap in our
knowledge of the Crab Pulsar's spectral energy distribution, suggesting that it
does not significantly flatten or invert at millimeter wavelengths. This work
demonstrates the potential for future searches of short-timescale astrophysical
phenomena with the next-generation CMB experiments like the Simons Observatory.

*Matías Sotomayor Webar,Yosef Abed,Dieter Horns*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 通过分析Mkn 501耀变体的伽马射线数据，首次发现星系际磁场存在的显著证据，磁场强度约为1.5×10⁻¹⁵ G，相干长度约10 kpc


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 星系际磁场(IGMF)的存在尚未通过观测确认，其起源可能是天体物理过程或早期宇宙相变遗迹，需要寻找观测证据

Method: 分析Fermi-LAT 14年数据和Swift-XRT/BAT数据，构建Mkn 501的同步自康普顿模型，使用ELMAG代码模拟不同磁场配置下的级联辐射，并与观测数据拟合

Result: 发现≥5σ显著性的扩展次级辐射，对应IGMF强度为1.5₋₀.₆⁺¹.⁶×10⁻¹⁵ G，相干长度10±3 kpc，源需要持续注入TeV伽马射线至少45000年

Conclusion: Fermi-LAT数据中显著存在次级伽马射线，等离子体加热效应可忽略，Mkn 501是研究级联辐射的合适对象

Abstract: The existence of intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMF) has so far not been
established through observations. The IGMF is expected to be generated either
via processes mainly connected to astrophysical processes or it could be a
relic of phase transitions in the early universe. Upper bounds to the average
field present are set via observations of Faraday rotation measure. Lower
bounds have been derived from the non-detection of secondary gamma-rays
possibly produced in electromagnetic cascades. We investigate the presence of
IGMFs by studying the GeV gamma-ray emission from the nearby blazar Mkn~501
($z=0.034$), searching for evidence of the extended halo expected to be
observed around the point source. We analyse 14 years of data from Fermi-LAT
and Swift-XRT/BAT to construct a time-average synchrotron-self Compton model
for the TeV spectrum of Mkn~501. This injection spectrum is used to simulate
the resulting cascade emission with the ELMAG code for different magnetic field
and coherence length configurations. These templates are fit to the Fermi-LAT
data to find a best-fitting model for the cascade emission. We find significant
($\ge 5 \sigma$ trial-corrected) evidence for extended secondary emission
around Mkn~501, which is consistent with an IGMF with
$B_\mathrm{rms}=1.5_{-0.6}^{+1.6}\times 10^{-15}~\mathrm{G}$ and a coherence
length of $\ell_C=(10\pm 3)~\mathrm{kpc}$. The source needs to actively inject
TeV gamma-rays for at least 45000 years to match the level of secondary
emission. Our results indicate that the secondary gamma-rays are significantly
present in the $\it{Fermi}$-LAT data. The effect of plasma-heating by pairs in
the cascade appears to be negligible for Mkn 501. This is consistent with the
observation that Mkn~501 is one of the objects with the lowest injection power
among the blazars studied in the context of cascade emission.

Motivation: 探索快速射电暴事件率随红移的演化规律，特别是重复与非重复FRB事件率的差异，以了解其宇宙学起源和爆发环境。

Method: 计算不同望远镜在1GHz以上/下频率检测到的重复FRB事件率，使用幂律形式分析光度与红移关系，采用bootstrap方法比较高低频FRB的事件率演化模式。

Result: 发现光度与红移存在正相关幂律演化；重复FRB事件率在红移小于1时超过恒星形成率；低频FRB事件率演化模式与高频不同且更高。

Conclusion: 重复FRB的事件率演化显示明显的宇宙学演化特征，高低频FRB具有不同的事件率演化模式，这对理解FRB的物理起源具有重要意义。

Abstract: How the event rate of fast radio bursts (FRBs) evolves with redshift is a hot
topic to explore their cosmological origin and the circum-burst environment.
Particularly, it is urgent to know what the difference of event rates between
repeating and non-repeating FRBs is. For the first time, we calculate the event
rates of repeating FRBs detected by diverse telescopes at frequencies
higher/lower than 1 GHz in this work. Luminosity and redshift are found to be
positively correlated with a power law form for both high- and low-frequency
FRBs, showing an obvious evolution of luminosity with redshift. Furthermore, we
compare the differential luminosity and local event rate distributions of high-
and low-luminosity FRBs at different frequencies. It is found that the event
rates of these sub-samples of repeating FRBs similarly exceed the star
formation rate at lower redshift than 1. Interestingly, we confirm with
bootstrap method that the event rates of low-frequency FRBs exhibit different
evolution patterns and are higher than that of high-frequency ones.

Motivation: 研究M74 X-1这一超亮X射线源的长时期光谱和时序特性，以深入了解其物理机制、中心天体性质以及吸积过程。

Method: 利用2001-2021年Chandra和XMM-Newton观测数据，进行光谱分析和时序研究，使用吸积盘+康普顿化模型、双温热盘黑体模型等多种光谱拟合方法。

Result: 发现耀发状态具有双组分光谱，非耀发状态为单组分光谱；检测到0.96 keV的谱线特征；硬度和光度呈正相关趋势；估计黑洞质量为7.1倍太阳质量。

Conclusion: M74 X-1是一个低倾角系统中的恒星级黑洞，存在超爱丁顿吸积，光谱特征表明存在双温发射区和可能的流出风，几何束流效应解释了硬度和光度的相关性。

Abstract: We conducted an extensive long-term spectral and timing study of the
ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) M74 X-1, using data taken between 2001 and
2021 by Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observatories. Our analysis shows that
flares are present in some observations, whereas they are absent in others.
Flaring state exhibits two-component spectra at a lower average flux level,
whereas the non-flaring state displays single-component spectra at a higher
average flux level. The M74 X-1 spectra are best described by the combination
of accretion disk and Comptonization components, a dual thermal disk blackbody
model, and a modified multi-temperature disk blackbody model. Using the dual
thermal disk blackbody model, we obtain cool and hot temperatures of $T_{in}$
(cool) = $0.38^{+0.08}_{-0.06}$ keV and $T_{in}$ (hot) = $1.67^{+0.18}_{-0.13}$
keV, respectively, suggesting two temperature emitting regions and indicating
possible presence of outflowing wind along with the accretion disk. We found a
Gaussian feature at $E_{line}$ = $0.96^{+0.05}_{-0.11}$ keV with $\sigma$ =
$0.11^{+0.13}_{-0.06}$ keV in the spectra of the flaring state which can be
interpreted as the unresolved wind feature in the system when compared to
similar feature seen in other ULXs. Plotting the hardness luminosity diagram,
we get a trend of increasing hardness with luminosity, suggesting the presence
of geometrical beaming in a low-inclination system. Additionally, using the hot
disk blackbody component from the dual thermal disk blackbody model, we
estimate the mass of the compact object to be M = $7.1^{+1.4}_{-1.3}$
M$_\odot$, classifying it as a stellar-mass black hole and confirming
super-Eddington accretion in the system.

Abstract: We analyse the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the eclipsing supersoft
X-ray source CAL 87 covering wavelengths from X-rays to the near-infrared. Our
study incorporates 26 data points across ultraviolet to near-infrared, sourced
from published literature, unpublished data, and new observations. In addition,
archival XMM-Newton spectra were used to represent the X-ray emission. Care was
taken to use out-of-eclipse flux measurements when the irradiated side of the
companion faces the observer. The SED model includes contributions from a
central source, a reprocessed accretion disk, and an irradiated companion star
atmosphere, resulting in a good match to the observed fluxes. The revised and
new parameters for the disk and the central source align with previous studies
and match expectations for such systems. The temperature of the irradiated side
of the companion star was estimated based on its B-V colour during the
secondary eclipse. This work highlights the importance of broad wavelength
coverage for understanding the properties of supersoft X-ray sources.

Result: 成功降低了计算成本，同时保持了追踪单个粒子加速过程的能力

Conclusion: 该方法可应用于多种天体物理激波配置，有效研究其对宇宙射线谱的贡献

Abstract: When supersonic plasma flows collide, many physical processes contribute to
the morphology of the resulting shock. One of these processes is the
acceleration of non-thermal ions, which will, eventually, reach relativistic
speeds and become cosmic rays. This process is difficult to simulate in a
computer model because it requires both macro-physics (the overall shape of the
shock) and micro-physics (the interaction between individual particles and the
magnetic field). The combined PIC-MHD method is one of several options to get
around this problem. It is based on the assumption that a plasma can be
described as a combination of a thermal gas, which can be accurately described
as a fluid using grid-based magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and a small non-thermal
component which has to be described as individual particles using
particle-in-cell (PIC). By combining aspects of both methods, we reduce the
computational costs while maintaining the ability to trace the acceleration of
individual particles. We apply this method to a variety of astrophysical shock
configurations to investigate if, and how, they can contribute to the cosmic
ray spectrum.

Conclusion: 观测结果支持N132D是由高能超新星在预存空腔中爆炸形成的理论，年龄约2500年，与光学膨胀测量结果一致，揭示了前身星的特性和爆炸环境的不均匀性。

Abstract: We present results from the Chandra X-ray Observatory Large Project (878 ks
in 28 observations) of the Large Magellanic Cloud supernova remnant N132D. We
measure the expansion of the forward shock in the bright southern rim to be
$0.\!^{\prime\prime}10 \pm 0.\!^{\prime\prime}02$ over the $\sim14.5$ yr
baseline, which corresponds to a velocity of $1620\pm400~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$
after accounting for several instrumental effects. We measure an expansion of
$0.\!^{\prime\prime}23 \pm 0.\!^{\prime\prime}02$ and a shock velocity of
$3840\pm260~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ for two features in an apparent blowout region
in the northeast. The emission-measure-weighted average temperature inferred
from X-ray spectral fits to regions in the southern rim is $0.95\pm0.17$ keV,
consistent with the electron temperature implied by the shock velocity after
accounting for Coulomb equilibration and adiabatic expansion. In contrast, the
emission-measure-weighted average temperature for the northeast region is
$0.77\pm0.04$ keV, which is significantly lower than the value inferred from
the shock velocity. We fit 1-D evolutionary models for the shock in the
southern rim and northeast region, using the measured radius and propagation
velocity into a constant density and power-law profile circumstellar medium. We
find good agreement with the age of $\sim2500$ years derived from optical
expansion measurements for explosion energies of $1.5-3.0 \times
10^{51}\,\mathrm{erg}$, ejecta masses of $2-6 \,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and ambient
medium densities of $\sim0.33-0.66$ $\mathrm{amu~cm}^{-3}$ in the south and
$\sim0.01-0.02$ $\mathrm{amu~cm}^{-3}$ in the northeast assuming a constant
density medium. These results are consistent with previous studies that
suggested the progenitor of N132D was an energetic supernova that exploded into
a pre-existing cavity.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of gravitational-wave (GW) recoil on the growth of
supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe. Forming ~10^9 Msun
SMBHs by z ~ 6 is challenging and may require hierarchical mergers of smaller
seed black holes. We extend a semi-analytic seed model (Sassano et al. 2021) by
explicitly incorporating GW recoil physics. Our model includes: (1) recoil
velocity formulae calibrated to numerical relativity for spinning, unequal-mass
BH binaries (Campanelli et al. 2007; Lousto et al. 2012); (2) assignment of
spin magnitudes and orientations based on seed type (Pop III remnant, stellar
cluster, or direct-collapse); and (3) a retention probability scheme comparing
the recoil speed to the host halo escape velocity. We find that including GW
recoil reduces final SMBH masses by ~20-30% by z = 6 and creates a population
of off-nuclear ("wandering") BHs amounting to a few percent of the total.
Observable consequences include spatial offsets ~0.1 arcsec and line-of-sight
velocity shifts ~10^2-10^3 km/s in a few percent of high-z quasars. All code is

Conclusion: 谱层面的成分分离方法比map-level方法能产生更小方差的二阶及以上统计量估计器

Abstract: Component separation methods mitigate the cross-contamination between
different extragalactic and galactic contributions to cosmic microwave
background (CMB) data. This is often done by linearly combining CMB maps from
different frequency channels using internal linear combination (ILC) methods.
We demonstrate that deriving power spectrum estimators directly by linearly
combining auto- and cross-spectra instead of maps allows us to obtain a
different constrained-optimization problem that allows fewer (deprojection)
constraint equations than combining at map level using the constrained ILC
method. Through simulations, we show that our Spectral internal linear
combination (SpILC) produces CMB power spectrum estimators with more than 7
times smaller errorbars than constrained ILC (with thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
and cosmic infrared background deprojections) at $\ell\gtrsim 4000$ for Simons
Observatory-like observations. Spectral ILC outperforms constrained ILC methods
when some modeled components are spatially uncorrelated, e.g. the primary CMB
is uncorrelated with foregrounds, and the difference in performance is most
significant at noise-dominated scales. More generally, our work shows that
component-separated maps with foreground deprojections do not necessarily
produce minimum-variance two-or-higher-point estimators.

Conclusion: 在未来精确搜索原初B模时，正确建模暗辐射相互作用对于获得无偏的暴胀引力波约束至关重要

Abstract: We investigate the cosmological imprint of self-interacting dark radiation
(DR) on the primordial $B$-mode angular power spectrum and its impact on the
estimation of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We consider a minimal model in
which DR is described as an effectively massless axion-like particle with
quartic self-interactions. These interactions are incorporated into the
Einstein-Boltzmann equations using the relaxation time approximation and
implemented in the $\texttt{CLASS}$ code. We show that increasing the strength
of DR self-interactions suppresses anisotropic stress, thereby reducing the
damping of gravitational waves and leading to an enhancement of the primordial
$B$-mode signal relative to the free-streaming case. Using mock CMB data and
Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses, we show that neglecting DR self-interactions
may bias the inferred value of $r$ by an amount comparable to the uncertainty
expected in forthcoming CMB polarization experiments, such as the ground-based
$\textit{Simons Observatory}$ and the satellite missions $\textit{LiteBIRD}$
and PICO. Our results emphasize the importance of properly modeling DR
interactions in future precision searches for primordial $B$-modes in order to
obtain unbiased constraints on inflationary gravitational waves.

Result: 在w0waCDM模型中，加入JWST数据使中微子质量上限收紧5.8%-10.2%，得到∑mν < 0.167 eV (2σ)，同时JWST提供了恒星形成效率参数的下限f*,10 ≳ 0.146-0.161。

Conclusion: JWST高红移数据和DESI低红移数据的联合分析为中微子质量提供了强有力的约束，值得进一步研究，贝叶斯证据略微支持w0waCDM+∑mν(NH)模型。

Abstract: Early JWST observations reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of
high-redshift candidate massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 7$, and recent DESI
measurements show a preference for dynamical dark energy, which together
present a significant challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In this
work, we jointly analyze high-redshift galaxy data from JWST, baryon acoustic
oscillations data from DESI DR2, and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data
from Planck and ACT, measuring the total neutrino mass $\sum m_{\nu}$. We
consider three dark energy models ($\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM) and
three mass hierarchies. Our results indicate that in the $w_0w_a$CDM model,
adding JWST data to CMB+DESI tightens the upper limit of $\sum m_{\nu}$ by
about $5.8\%-10.2\%$, and we obtain $\sum m_{\nu} < 0.167~\mathrm{eV}$
($2\sigma$) in the normal hierarchy (NH) case. Furthermore, JWST also offers
indicative lower limits on star formation efficiency parameter of $f_{*,10}
\gtrsim 0.146-0.161$. Bayesian evidence weakly favors the $w_0w_a$CDM+$\sum
m_{\nu}$(NH) model relative to the $\Lambda$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$(NH) model using
CMB+DESI+JWST data. These results suggest that the joint analysis of
high-redshift JWST data and low-redshift DESI data provides compelling
constraints on neutrino mass and merits further investigation.

TL;DR: 本文研究了曲率子场景中原初黑洞的形成，通过精确的非线性映射计算了完整的概率分布函数，发现非高斯性显著增强了黑洞产生，并产生了扩展的质量谱和相关的随机引力波背景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原初黑洞是探测早期宇宙小尺度结构的重要探针，可能构成暗物质的一部分。其形成对原初曲率扰动的非高斯特征高度敏感，而曲率子衰变会在小尺度上产生大的固有非高斯涨落。

Method: 使用高斯曲率子场扰动与曲率扰动之间的精确非线性映射，计算完整的非微扰概率分布函数，不依赖截断的非高斯展开。通过对数正态分布模拟曲率子涨落的尺度依赖性。

Result: 非高斯分布的增强尾部显著放大了原初黑洞的产生，使形成分数对曲率子衰变分数具有指数敏感性。获得了扩展的原初黑洞质量谱而非单色峰，并发现了相关的二阶诱导随机引力波背景。

Conclusion: 曲率子场景自然地产生了丰富的原初黑洞和引力波现象学，与高斯单场暴胀模型截然不同，为连接小尺度非高斯物理与未来观测提供了框架。

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a unique probe of the small-scale
primordial Universe and may constitute a fraction of the dark matter. Their
formation is highly sensitive to non-Gaussian features in the primordial
curvature perturbation $\zeta$. In this work we investigate PBH production in
the curvaton scenario, where the decay of a late-time light scalar field
imprints large, inherently non-Gaussian fluctuations on small scales. Using the
exact non-linear mapping between the Gaussian curvaton field perturbations and
$\zeta$, we compute the full non-perturbative probability distribution
functions of $\zeta$ and derive the PBH formation fraction $\beta$ without
relying on a truncated non-Gaussian expansion. We show that the enhanced tail
of the distribution dramatically amplifies PBH production, leading to an
exponential sensitivity of $\beta$ to the curvaton decay fraction
$\Omega_{\chi,\rm dec}$. By modeling the scale dependence of curvaton
fluctuations with a lognormal profile, we obtain realistic, extended PBH mass
spectra rather than monochromatic peaks. We further highlight the associated
stochastic gravitational-wave background induced at second order, whose peak
frequency correlates directly with the PBH mass scale. Our results demonstrate
that the curvaton scenario naturally produces a rich phenomenology of PBHs and
gravitational waves, sharply distinct from Gaussian single-field inflation
models, and provide a framework for connecting small-scale non-Gaussian physics
to upcoming gravitational-wave and PBH observations.

Abstract: It is thought that the Universe went through an early period known as the
Dark Ages, during which primeval density fluctuations grew to form the first
luminous objects, marking the beginning of Cosmic Dawn around 100 million years
after the Big Bang. The 21-cm line of hydrogen atoms is the most promising
probe of these epochs, with extensive observational efforts underway. We
combine hydrodynamical simulations with a large-scale grid in order to
precisely calculate the effect of non-linear structure formation on the global
(sky-averaged) 21-cm radio intensity. We show that it presents a potential
opportunity to probe the properties of dark matter in a new regime,
corresponding to a length-scale of only 150,000 light years and a mass-scale of
20 million Solar masses. This effect can in principle be detected unambiguously
during the Dark Ages, where the weak signal requires an array of global signal
antennae. During Cosmic Dawn, when stellar radiation boosts the signal, a
single global antenna suffices, but the clumping effect must then be separated
from the effect of the stars. Our findings open new avenues for testing the
nature of dark matter as well as non-standard cosmological models.

Result: 即使适度的尘埃富集也能显著降低有效LW辐射场，使H2冷却在先前认为受LW反馈影响的区域持续存在，扩展了重种子形成的红移范围和空间体积

Conclusion: 尘埃屏蔽显著改变了不同种子种群的相对重要性，对高红移超大质量黑洞的形成和未来观测具有重要影响

Abstract: We investigate the impact of dust shielding on Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation
fields and its implications for supermassive black hole (SMBH) seed formation
at high redshift. Using an updated version of the GAMETE/QSOdust
semi-analytical model, we implement a simple dust shielding prescription that
accounts for the absorption of LW photons by dust grains. We find that even
modest dust enrichment can significantly reduce the effective LW radiation
field, allowing H2 cooling to persist in regions previously thought to be
affected by LW feedback. This changes the conditions for seed formation,
particularly for heavy seeds which require suppression of H2 cooling. Our
results suggest that dust shielding extends the redshift range and volume where
heavy seeds can form, and significantly alters the relative importance of
different seed populations. We discuss the implications for the formation of
high-redshift SMBHs and future observations.

Conclusion: 该模型为解决宇宙学张力提供了新的现象学途径，并有助于揭示暗物质的性质

Abstract: We propose that dark matter (DM) possesses a quadratic equation of state,
which becomes significant at high densities, altering the Universe's evolution
during its early stages. We derive the modified background evolution equations
for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and the DM density parameter
$\Omega_{\text{dm}}(z)$. We then perturb the governing equations to study the
linear growth of matter fluctuations, computing the observable growth factor
$f\sigma_8(z)$. Finally, we compare the model with the latest cosmological
data, including Hubble parameter $H(z)$ measurements, and growth factor
$f\sigma_8(z)$ data, up to $z=3$. Our results indicate that the quadratic
model, while remaining consistent with background observations, offers a
distinct imprint on the growth of structure, providing not only a new
phenomenological avenue to address cosmological tensions but also shedding
light on the nature of DM.

Abstract: The 21-cm line of hydrogen is the most promising probe of the Dark Ages and
Cosmic Dawn. We combine hydrodynamical simulations with a large-scale grid in
order to calculate the effect of non-linear structure formation on the
large-scale 21-cm power spectrum, focusing on redshifts $z=20-40$. As the
clumping effect arises from small-scale density fluctuations, it offers a
unique opportunity to probe the standard cold dark matter model in a new regime
and thus potentially investigate the properties of dark matter. To this end, we
also study a warm dark matter $-$ like model with a Gaussian cutoff on a scale
of 50 kpc. We find that clumping has a significant impact on the large-scale
21-cm power spectrum. For example, for the Dark Ages case at $z=30$ and
wavenumber $k=0.05$ Mpc$^{-1}$, small-scale clustering enhances the 21-cm power
spectrum by $13\%$. Once Lyman-$\alpha$ coupling kicks in due to the first
stars, the 21-cm signal strengthens, and the effect of clumping grows; it
suppresses the observable power spectrum at $z=20$ by a factor of two, while
the cutoff model has less than half the clumping impact. The clumping effect is
significantly higher than the sensitivity of the planned Square Kilometre Array
(SKA) AA$^\star$ configuration, by up to a factor of 20 for standard cold dark
matter, though detection will require separation from foregrounds and from
astrophysical contributions to the 21-cm power spectrum.

Abstract: Ly$\alpha$ intensity mapping is emerging as a new probe of faint galaxies
consisting the cosmic web that elude traditional surveys. However, the resonant
nature of Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer complicates the interpretation of
observed data. In this study, we develop a fast and accurate analytic
prescription for computing the Ly$\alpha$ intensity field on Mpc scales in the
post-reionization Universe. Motivated by insights from Monte Carlo radiative
transfer (MCRT) experiments, we exploit the fact that in a highly ionized
intergalactic medium (IGM) with negligible damping-wing opacity, cosmological
redshifting quickly drives Ly$\alpha$ photons out of resonance, terminating the
scattering process and simplifying their large-scale behavior. Photons emitted
blueward of the Ly$\alpha$ line center tend to scatter on a thin, nearly
spherical surface of last scattering, with a radius determined by the
redshifting distance to resonance. Based on this behavior, we derive
closed-form expressions for the scattered emissivity and projected surface
brightness that depend only on the source spectrum, the HI density, and the
peculiar velocity field. When applied to a source in a realistically simulated
IGM at $z = 3$, our model shows mild discrepancies with MCRT results within a
physical Mpc of the host halo, where strong gravitational infall redistributes
the scattered photons, but achieves better than 5% accuracy beyond that
distance in both raw and cumulative surface brightness. Our prescription offers
a computationally efficient alternative to MCRT for forward-modeling Ly$\alpha$
intensity maps from cosmological simulations, enabling the inference of
underlying cosmological and astrophysical parameters from future observations.

Abstract: We select galaxy cluster candidates from the high-redshift (BEST_Z > 0.9) end
of the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) galaxy cluster catalogue, for
which we obtain moderately deep J-band imaging data with the OMEGA2000 camera
at the 3.5m telescope of the Calar Alto Observatory. We include J-band data of
four additional targets obtained with the three-channel camera at the 2m
Fraunhofer telescope at the Wendelstein Observatory. We complement the new
J-band photometric catalogue with forced photometry in the i- and z-bands of
the tenth data release of the Legacy Survey (LSDR10) to derive the radial
colour distribution around the eRASS1 clusters. Without assuming a priori to
find a cluster red sequence at a specific colour, we try to find a radially
weighted colour over-density to confirm the presence of high-redshift optical
counterparts for the X-ray emission. We compare our confirmation with optical
properties derived in earlier works based on LSDR10 data to refine the existing
high-redshift cluster confirmation of eROSITA-selected clusters. We attempt to
calibrate the colour-redshift-relation including the new J-band data by
comparing our obtained photometric redshift estimate with the spectroscopic
redshift of a confirmed, optically selected, high-redshift galaxy cluster. We
confirm 9 out of 18 of the selected galaxy cluster candidates with a radial
over-density of similar coloured galaxies for which we provide a photometric
redshift estimate. We can report an increase in the relative colour measurement
precision from 8% to 4% when including J-band data. In conclusion, our findings
indicate a not insignificant spurious contaminant fraction at the high-redshift
end (BEST_Z > 0.9) of the eROSITA/eRASS1 galaxy cluster catalogue, as well as
it underlines the necessity for wide and deep near infrared imaging data for
confirmation and characterisation of high-$z$ galaxy clusters.

Conclusion: 精确测量要求向上修正天空亮度，需要重新审视射电源群和暗物质衰变模型，修正后的天空模型将为低频射电望远镜（如SKA-Low）提供稳定的绝对通量密度校准参考。

Abstract: Precise measurement of the sky radio brightness below 1 GHz and estimation of
any unaccounted-for extragalactic brightness is required to understand the
Galactic cosmic ray electron spectrum, to constrain populations of nanojansky
radio sources, and to constrain dark matter annihilation or decay. The
foreground radio brightness must also be accurately accounted for when
measuring the cosmic background radiation and departures from its Planck
spectrum that trace astrophysical processes in the early Universe, cosmic dark
ages, cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionisation. Here we report a new,
precision measurement of the sky spectral brightness over radio frequencies
from 60 MHz to 350 MHz. Our measurement motivates a significant correction to
previous all-sky images made in this band and the Global Sky Model (GSM) that
is constructed from these and other sky images made at radio wavelengths. We
find that the GSM requires subtraction of an offset exceeding 100K below 100
MHz and scaling up by a factor of approximately 1.2 below 200 MHz rising to a
factor of 1.5 at 350 MHz, thus significantly enhancing previous estimates of
unaccounted excess in radio sky brightness. Our measurements were made with a
new receiver architecture that dynamically self-calibrates for receiver noise
and bandpass in situ, while connected to an antenna. We used a single,
accurately modelled, wideband logperiodic antenna placed on a 40m diameter
ground mesh. Our accurate measurement requires upward revision of sky
brightness and motivates revisiting models for source populations and dark
matter decay. Additionally, sky models scaled to our measurements serve as a
stable reference in calibrating the absolute flux density scale for
low-frequency radio telescopes. This will be important for calibration accuracy
of the SKA-Low telescope, that will operate at the frequencies of our
measurements.

Method: 使用协变耦合常数（CCC）参数α，结合宇宙膨胀和疲劳光效应，分析SPARC数据库中的星系旋转曲线

Conclusion: 协变耦合常数模型为解释天体物理观测提供了暗物质和暗能量之外的替代方案，局部物质分布会影响α参数的取值

Abstract: This paper aims to explore whether astrophysical observations, primarily
galaxy rotation curves, result from covarying coupling constants (CCC) rather
than from dark matter. We have shown in earlier papers that cosmological
observations, such as supernovae type 1a (Pantheon+), the small size of
galaxies at cosmic dawn, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), the sound horizon
in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and time dilation effect, can be
easily accounted for without requiring dark energy and dark matter when
coupling constants are permitted to evolve in an expanding Universe, as
predicted by Dirac, and the redshift is considered jointly due to the
Universe's expansion and Zwicky's tired light (TL) effect. Here, we show that
the CCC parameter {\alpha} is responsible for generating the illusion of dark
matter and dark energy, which we call {\alpha}-matter and {\alpha}-energy, and
is influenced by the baryonic matter density distribution. While cosmologically
{\alpha} is a constant determined for the homogenous and isotropic Universe,
e.g., by fitting Pantheon+ data, it can vary locally due to the extreme
anisotropy of the matter distribution. Thus, in high baryonic density regions,
one expects {\alpha}-matter and {\alpha}-energy densities to be relatively low
and vice versa. We present its application to a few galaxy rotation curves from
the SPARC database and find the results promising.

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了在宇宙学张力背景下重新审视我们对早期宇宙理解的重要性，早期暗能量解决方案对原始扰动谱有重要影响

Abstract: It is commonly recognized that the primordial scalar spectral index $n_s$ is
approximately $0.96-0.975$, depending on the dataset. However, this view is
being completely altered by the early dark energy (EDE) resolutions of the
Hubble tension, known as the most prominent tension the standard $\Lambda$CDM
model is suffering from. In corresponding models with pre-recombination EDE,
resolving the Hubble tension (i.e., achieving $H_0\sim 73$km/s/Mpc) must be
accompanied by a shift of $n_s$ towards unity to maintain consistency with the
cosmological data, which thus implies a scale invariant Harrison-Zel'dovich
spectrum with $n_s=1$ $(|n_s-1|\simeq {\cal O}(0.001))$. In this work, we
strengthen and reconfirm this result with the latest ground-based CMB data from
ACT DR6 and SPT-3G D1, the precise measurements at high multipoles beyond the
Planck angular resolution and sensitivity. Our work again highlights the
importance of re-examining our understanding on the very early Universe within
the broader context of cosmological tensions.

Method: 使用加速参考系中的引力势（boosted potential），通过计算最接近鞍点连接的更深势阱的逃逸能量来判断粒子是否束缚。仅使用瞬时信息，无需动力学历史。

Result: 粒子通常在第一次近心点和远心点之间被束缚，束缚和非束缚粒子在相空间分布、密度剖面、维里比和红移演化方面表现出明显不同的特征。

Conclusion: 晕可以理解为双组分系统：束缚组分是维里化的、有限范围的、缓慢演化的准平衡系统；非束缚组分是非维里化的、快速演化的。这种方法为理解暗物质晕结构提供了新视角。

Abstract: Here, we present a novel algorithm that discriminates between bound and
unbound particles by consideration of the gravitational potential from an
accelerated reference frame -- also referred to as `the boosted potential'.
Particles are considered bound if their energy does not exceed the escape
energy of a potential well -- given by the closest saddle-point that connects
to a deeper potential minimum. This approach has core benefits over previous
approaches, since it does not require any ad-hoc thresholds (such as
over-density criteria), it includes the gravitational effect of all particles
in the binding criterion (improving over widely used self-potential binding
checks) and it only operates with instantaneous information (making it simpler
than approaches based on dynamical histories). We show that particles typically
become bound between their first peri- and apo-centeric passage and that bound
and unbound populations show very distinct characteristics through their
distribution in phase space, their density profiles, their virial ratios, and
their redshift evolution. Our findings suggest that it is possible to
understand haloes as two-component systems, with one component being bound,
virialized, of finite extent and evolving slowly in quasi-equilibrium and the
other component being unbound, unvirialized and evolving rapidly.

Abstract: We investigate axion-like particles coupled to gravity through a
parity-violating Chern-Simons (CS) interaction. In this framework, axion dark
matter (DM) can decay into pairs of circularly polarized gravitons, producing a
persistent, nearly monochromatic GW signal. We compute the expected signal at
Earth assuming a Navarro-Frenk-White Galactic halo model with the corresponding
velocity distribution, and compare it with the narrowband sensitivities of the
LIGO O4 run and the projected reach of the Einstein Telescope. The resulting
bounds on the axion-graviton coupling $\alpha$ improve upon the cosmological
stability requirement for axion masses $m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-11}$ eV, excluding
values up to four orders of magnitude below the stability limit. This
constitutes a robust direct terrestrial constraint on the axion-gravity CS
coupling. We also discuss distinctive observational signatures, such as
circular polarization asymmetries, annual modulation, and potential
enhancements from DM substructures, which could serve as smoking-gun evidence
for parity-violating gravitational interactions.

Abstract: The current cosmological model, known as the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model
(or $\Lambda$CDM for short) is one of the most astonishing accomplishments of
contemporary theoretical physics. It is a well-defined mathematical model which
depends on very few ingredients and parameters and is able to make a range of
predictions and postdictions with astonishing accuracy. It is built out of
well-known physics - general relativity, quantum mechanics and atomic physics,
statistical mechanics and thermodynamics - and predicts the existence of new,
unseen components. Again and again it has been shown to fit new data sets with
remarkable precision. Despite these successes, we have yet to understand the
unseen components of the Universe and there has been evidence for
inconsistencies in the model. In these lectures, we lay the foundations of
modern cosmology.

Abstract: Precise determination of galaxy cluster masses is crucial for establishing
reliable mass-observable scaling relations in cluster cosmology. We employ
graph neural networks (GNNs) to estimate galaxy cluster masses from radially
sampled profiles of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) inferred from X-ray
observations. GNNs naturally handle inputs of variable length and resolution by
representing each ICM profile as a graph, enabling accurate and flexible
modeling across diverse observational conditions. We trained and tested GNN
model using state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters from
The Three Hundred Project. The mass estimates using our method exhibit no
systematic bias compared to the true cluster masses in the simulations.
Additionally, we achieve a scatter in recovered mass versus true mass of about
6\%, which is a factor of six smaller than obtained from a standard hydrostatic
equilibrium approach. Our algorithm is robust to both data quality and cluster
morphology and it is capable of incorporating model uncertainties alongside
observational uncertainties. Finally, we apply our technique to XMM-Newton
observed galaxy cluster samples and compare the GNN derived mass estimates with
those obtained with $Y_{\rm SZ}$-M$_{500}$ scaling relations. Our results
provide strong evidence, at 5$\sigma$ level, for a mass-dependent bias in SZ
derived masses, with higher mass clusters exhibiting a greater degree of
deviation. Furthermore, we find the median bias to be $(1-b)=0.85_{-14}^{+34}$,
albeit with significant dispersion due to its mass dependence. This work takes
a significant step towards establishing unbiased observable mass scaling
relations by integrating X-ray, SZ and optical datasets using deep learning
techniques, thereby enhancing the role of galaxy clusters in precision
cosmology.

We find that the X-ray spectra are predominantly thermal and can be described by low-absorbed blackbody models with effective temperatures ranging from 50 to 210 eV. In two sources, the spectra also show narrow absorption features at $300 - 400$ eV. Additional non-thermal emission components are not detected in any of the five candidates. The soft X-ray emission, the absence of optical counterparts in four sources, and the consequent large X-ray-to-optical flux ratios $>3000 - 5400$ confirm their INS nature. For the remaining source, eRASSU J144516.0-374428, the available data do not allow a confident exclusion of an active galactic nucleus nature. However, if the source is Galactic, the small inferred X-ray emitting region is reminiscent of a heated pulsar polar cap, possibly pointing to a binary pulsar nature. X-ray timing searches do not detect significant modulations in all candidates, implying pulsed fraction upper limits of 13 - 19% ($0.001-13.5$ Hz). The absence of pulsations in the FAST observations targeting eRASSU J081952.1-131930 and eRASSU J084046.2-115222 excludes periodic magnetospheric emission at 1 - 1.5 GHz with an $8σ$ significance down to 4.08 $μ$Jy and 2.72 $μ$Jy, respectively. The long-term X-ray emission of all sources does not imply significant variability. Additional observations are warranted to establish exact neutron star types. At the same time, the confirmation of the predominantly thermal neutron star nature in four additional sources highlights the power of SRG/eROSITA to complement the Galactic INS population."}

Blazars, a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with jets pointed close to our line of sight, offer a unique view into jet dynamics. Blazar $γ$-ray light curves exhibit rapid, high-amplitude flares that point to promising alternative dissipation mechanisms such as magnetic reconnection. This study uses three-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) and resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (ResRMHD) simulations with the PLUTO code to explore magnetic reconnection in turbulent, magnetized plasma columns. Focusing on current-driven kink instabilities, we identify the formation of current sheets due to magnetic reconnection, leading to plasmoid formation. We develop a novel technique combining hierarchical structure analysis and reconnection diagnostics to identify reconnecting current sheets. A statistical analysis of their geometry and orientation reveals a smaller subset that aligns closely with the jet axis, consistent with the jet-in-jet model. These structures can generate relativistically moving plasmoids with significant Doppler boosting, offering a plausible mechanism for the fast flares superimposed on slowly varying blazar light curves. These findings provide new insights into the plasma dynamics of relativistic jets and strengthen the case for magnetic reconnection as a key mechanism in blazar $γ$-ray variability."}

One of its intriguing features is the presence of relativistic radio jets almost perpendicular to the observed extended gamma-ray emission, implying significant propagation effects or interactions with the Galactic magnetic field. Here we report observational evidence that the radio jet and the very high-energy (VHE) and ultra high-energy (UHE) gamma-ray emission could be aligned along a common axis, indicating a co-spatial or co-directional origin. This alignment supports a model where synchrotron radio emission, VHE and UHE gamma rays are produced within a single, highly collimated relativistic outflow. Our findings favor scenarios of in-situ particle acceleration up to hundreds of TeV, challenge previous interpretations involving large-scale particle diffusion, and simplify the geometric modeling of the source. This case highlights the potential of V4641 Sgr as a PeVatron candidate within our Galaxy and provides a benchmark for understanding jet composition and magnetic structure in microquasars."}

In light of current and upcoming all-sky radio surveys, PMFs have drawn attention not only as major candidates for explaining the large-scale magnetisation of the Universe, but also as potential probes of early-Universe physics. In this paper, using cosmological simulations coupled with light-cone analysis, we study for the first time the imprints of the PMF structure on the mean rotation measure (RM) originating in the intergalactic medium (IGM), $\\langle \\mathrm{RM_{IGM}}\\rangle$. We introduce a new method for producing full-sky $\\mathrm{RM_{IGM}}$ distributions and analyse the autocorrelation of $\\mathrm{RM_{IGM}}$ on small and large angular scales; we find that PMF structures indeed show distinct signatures. The large-scale uniform model (characterised by an initially unlimited coherence scale) leads to correlations up to 90 degrees, while correlations for small-scale stochastic PMF models drop by factor of $100$ at $ 0.17, 0.13$ and 0.11 degrees angular scales, corresponding to $5.24, 4.03$ and $3.52$ Mpc scales (at $z=2$ redshift) for magnetic fields with comoving $3.49, 1.81, 1.00 $ Mpc/h coherence scales, respectively; the correlation amplitude of the PMF model with comoving $\\sim 19$ Mpc/h coherence scale drops only by factor of $10$ at 1 degree (30.6 Mpc). These results suggests that improvements in the modelling of Galactic RM will be necessary to investigate the signature of large-scale correlated PMFs.

Submitted to ApJ. Comments are welcome", "summary": "The elevated UV luminosity functions (UVLF) from recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have challenged the viability of existing theoretical models. To address this, we use a semi-analytical framework -- which couples a physically motivated source model derived from radiative-transfer hydrodynamic simulations of reionization with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler -- to perform a joint calibration to JWST galaxy surveys (UVLF, $φ_{\\rm UV}$ and UV luminosity density, $ρ_{\\rm UV}$) and reionization-era observables (ionizing emissivity, $\\dot{N}_{\\rm ion}$, neutral hydrogen fraction, $x_{\\rm HI}$, and Thomson optical depth, $τ$). We find that models with weak feedback and a higher contribution from faint galaxies reproduce the reionization observables but struggle to match the elevated JWST UVLF at $z > 9$. In contrast, models with stronger feedback (i.e., rapid redshift evolution) and a higher contribution from bright galaxies successfully reproduce JWST UVLF at $z \\geq 10$, but over-estimate the bright end at $z < 9$. The strong-feedback model constrained by JWST UVLF predicts a more gradual and extended reionization history, as opposed to the sudden reionization seen in the weak-feedback models. This extended nature of reionization ($z\\sim 16$ - $6$) yields an optical depth consistent (at 2-$σ$) with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) constraint, thereby alleviating the photon-budget crisis. In both scenarios, reionization is complete by $z \\sim 6$, consistent with current data. Our analysis highlights the importance of accurately modeling feedback and ionizing emissivities from different source populations during the first billion years after the Big Bang."}

In this work, we present targeted radio observations of 31 such candidates using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, and the Shanghai TianMa Radio Telescope. Over a total of 46.65 hours of observing time, we detected neither periodic nor single-pulse radio emissions. These nondetections place stringent upper limits on the flux densities of any potential radio signals, reaching ~4 $μ$Jy for periodic emission and ~10 mJy for single pulses with FAST. Since our observations are highly sensitive and the flux density upper limits are well below the median fluxes of known Galactic pulsars, this suggests that geometric beaming is the most likely explanation for the non-detections if these objects are indeed pulsars. Alternatively, the NSs may be sufficiently old ($\\gtrsim$ 10 Gyr) and have become intrinsically radio-quiet. In this case, our findings highlight the inherent difficulty of confirming NSs in such old detached binary systems through radio pulsation searches."}

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "The enrichment history of galaxy clusters and groups remains far from being fully understood. Recent measurements in massive clusters have revealed remarkably flat iron abundance profiles out to the outskirts, suggesting that similar enrichment processes have occurred for all systems. In contrast, abundance profiles in galaxy groups have sometimes been measured to decline with radius, challenging our understanding of the physical processes at these scales. In this paper, we present a pilot study aimed at accurately measuring the iron abundance profiles of MKW3s, A2589, and Hydra A, three poor clusters with total masses of $M_{500} \\simeq 2.0-2.5 \\times 10^{14}$ M$_\\odot$, intermediate between the scales of galaxy groups and massive clusters. Using XMM-Newton to obtain nearly complete azimuthal coverage of the outer regions of these systems, we show that abundance measurements in the outskirts are more likely to be limited by systematics than by statistical errors. In particular, inaccurate modelling of the soft X-ray background can significantly bias metallicity estimates in regions where the cluster emission is faint. Once these systematics are properly accounted for, the abundance profiles of all three clusters appear to be flat at $Z \\sim 0.3$ Z$_{\\odot}$, in agreement with values observed in massive clusters. Using available stellar mass estimates, we also computed their iron yields, thereby beginning to probe a largely unexplored mass range. We find $Y_{Fe,500} = 2.68\\pm0.34$, $2.54\\pm0.64$, and $7.51\\pm1.47$ Z$_{\\odot}$ for MKW3s, A2589, and Hydra A, respectively, spanning the transition regime between galaxy groups and massive clusters. Future observations of systems with temperatures of $2-4$ keV will be essential to further populate this intermediate-mass regime and to draw firmer conclusions on the chemical enrichment history of galaxy systems across the full mass scale."}

Among these, optically thin inverse-Compton (IC) scattering remains an important yet under-tested mechanism. From an initial set of 41 bursts selected using empirical Band-function criteria that highlight quasi-thermal low-energy slopes ($α> -0.5$) and constrained high-energy indices ($-1.7 > β> -3.3$), only four events satisfy these conditions consistently in both time-integrated and time-resolved spectra.

Submitted to A&A, comments welcome", "summary": "Cosmological simulations predict significant secondary dependencies of halo clustering on internal properties and environment. Detecting these subtle signals in observational data remains challenging, with important ramifications for galaxy evolution and cosmology. We probe secondary halo bias in observational survey data, using galaxy groups as dark matter halo proxies. We quantify secondary bias using central galaxy colour and environmental diagnostics. We use an extended, refined galaxy group catalogue from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Secondary bias is defined as any deviation in group clustering strength at fixed mass, quantified through the projected two-point correlation function. Our environmental analysis uses DisPerSE to compute distances to critical points of the density field, incorporating local group overdensity measurements on multiple scales. We robustly detect several forms of secondary bias in the clustering of galaxy groups. At fixed mass, groups hosting red central galaxies are more strongly clustered than those with blue centrals, with $b_{\\rm relative}$ ranging from $\\sim 1.2$ for the 15\\% reddest centrals to $\\sim 0.8$ for the bluest ones. Environmental dependencies based on cosmic-web distances are also present, though significantly weaker and largely mass-independent. The strongest signal arises from local overdensity: groups in the densest 15\\% of environments reach $b_{\\rm relative} \\sim 1.4$, while those in the least dense regions fall to $b_{\\rm relative} \\sim 0.7$. These results establish a clear observational hierarchy for secondary halo bias. The colour of central galaxies correlates with the local group overdensity, which, in turn, correlates with the bias at fixed group mass. Assuming that central galaxy colour traces halo assembly history, this three-stage picture offers a conceptual link between our results and halo assembly bias."}

In this study, we examine how the data coverage influences the reliability of parameter estimation within the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) framework. Using OJ 287, TXS 0506+056, and Mrk 421 as representative of the low-, intermediate- and high synchrotron peak classes (LSP, ISP and HSP), respectively, we generate synthetic SEDs based on their best-fit models and perform 1,000 fits for each of the 21 observational configurations per source type. Our analysis quantifies the coverage probability for all model parameters, such has the magnetic field strength and the electron luminosity, and reveals that different blazar subclasses exhibit distinct sensitivities to spectral gaps. For LSPs, a minimal dataset comprising optical/UV, X-ray, and GeV $γ$-ray bands is sufficient for robust parameter inference. In contrast, ISPs and HSPs require broader spectral coverage to constrain the physical parameters. For ISP, we find that reliable parameter recovery can be achieved with two different minimal band combinations: \\textit{(i)} X-ray, high energy $γ$-ray, and very high energy $γ$-ray data, or \\textit{(ii)} optical/UV, X-ray, and high energy $γ$-ray data. For HSPs, the minimal configuration enabling reliable parameter recovery includes the optical/UV, X-ray, and very high energy $γ$-ray bands. We discuss the role of very high energy $γ$-ray observations, showing that they significantly enhance parameter recovery for HSPs. Our results provide practical guidelines for designing optimized multi-wavelength observation campaigns and for assessing the robustness of SSC model inferences under incomplete spectral coverage."}

This ensures that divergence errors in the magnetic field are actively propagated away and damped, rather than merely being advected with the flow or partially controlled by source terms. To validate our implementation, we perform a series of standard test problems, including the advection of divergence errors, the Orszag-Tang vortex, the Brio-Wu shock tube, and magnetised Zeldovich pancakes. These tests confirm that our scheme successfully reduces divergence errors while preserving the correct physical evolution of the system.\n  We then apply the method to a fully cosmological simulation of a massive galaxy cluster, comparing the results to those obtained using the previously employed Powell eight-wave divergence preserving scheme. We find that the overall density structure of the cluster is largely unaffected by the choice of divergence cleaning method, and the magnetic field geometry and strengths in the cluster core remain similar. However, in the cluster outskirts ($r \\approx$~1-3~$h^{-1}$~Mpc), the magnetic field is amplified by a factor of $\\sim$ 5 compared to the Powell-only approach. Moreover, the constrained divergence cleaning algorithm reduces the divergence error by 2-3 orders of magnitude throughout the cluster volume, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining the solenoidal condition of the magnetic field in large-scale cosmological simulations.

Through a second-order phase transition, fermion - antifermion pairs condense and the system asymptotes towards zero temperature and pressure. By the present era, the non-relativistic, massive condensate decays slightly faster than in the standard scenario -- a unique prediction that may be tested by combined measurements of the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure.

Recent studies, however, indicate that galaxy clusters occupy a parallel but offset relation, raising questions about the universality of the BTFR. Here, we demonstrate that the offset between galaxies and clusters arises naturally from cosmic time evolution. Using the evolving BTFR derived from the Nexus Paradigm of quantum gravity, we show that the normalization of the relation evolves as an exponential function of cosmic time., while the slope remains fixed at $\\sim 4$. This provides a simple and predictive framework in which both galaxies and clusters obey the same universal scaling law, with their apparent offset reflecting their different formation epochs. Our results unify mass- velocity scaling across five orders of magnitude in baryonic mass, offering new insights into cosmic structure formation."}

Using two simulation suites -- one comprising large boxes ($3750\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$) and another constructed by tiling small boxes ($625\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$) -- we generate full-sky convergence maps and extract $10^\\circ \\times 10^\\circ$ patches via a Fibonacci grid. We consider biases in the mean and covariance of the angular power spectrum, bispectrum (up to $\\ell=3000$), PDF, peak/minima counts, and Minkowski functionals. By first identifying lines of sight that are impacted by replications, we find that replication causes a O$(10\\%)$ bias in the PDF and Minkowski functionals, and a O$(1\\%)$ bias in other summary statistics. Replication also causes a O$(10\\%)$ bias in the covariances, increasing with source redshift and $\\ell$, reaching $\\sim25\\%$ for $z_s=2.5$. We additionally show that replication leads to heavy biases (up to O$(100\\%)$ at high redshift) when performing gnomonic projection on a patch that is centered along a direction of replication. We then identify the lines of sight that are minimally affected by replication, and use the corresponding patches to isolate and study super-sample effects, finding that, while the mean values agree to within $1\\%$, the variances differ by O$(10\\%)$ for $z_s\\leq2.5$. We show that these effects remain in the presence of noise and smoothing scales typical of the DES, KiDS, HSC, LSST, Euclid, and Roman surveys. We also discuss how these effects scale as a function of box size. Our results highlight the importance of large simulation volumes for accurate lensing statistics and covariance estimation."}

However, favoring a more simplified, spherically symmetric model for galaxy clusters can lead to biases in the estimates of cluster properties. In this work, we present a deep-learning approach for estimating the triaxiality and orientations of massive galaxy clusters (those with masses $\\gtrsim 10^{14}\\,M_\\odot h^{-1}$) from 2D observables. We utilize the flagship hydrodynamical volume of the suite of cosmological-hydrodynamical MillenniumTNG (MTNG) simulations as our ground truth. Our model combines the feature extracting power of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and the message passing power of a graph neural network (GNN) in a multi-modal, fusion network. Our model is able to extract 3D geometry information from 2D idealized cluster multi-wavelength images (soft X-ray, medium X-ray, hard X-ray and tSZ effect) and mathematical graph representations of 2D cluster member observables (line-of-sight radial velocities, 2D projected positions and V-band luminosities). Our network improves cluster geometry estimation in MTNG by $30\\%$ compared to assuming spherical symmetry. We report an $R^2 = 0.85$ regression score for estimating the major axis length of triaxial clusters and correctly classifying $71\\%$ of prolate clusters with elongated orientations along our line-of-sight."}

Of these, the sound speed $c_s$ is determined by the equation of state $p(T,φ)$. In most studies, the plasma of the early universe has been assumed to be ultrarelativistic and therefore following the bag equation of state with $c_s = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n  In this thesis, the PTtools simulation framework for first-order phase transitions, based on the Sound Shell Model, has been extended to include support for arbitrary equations of state and therefore for a temperature- and phase-dependent sound speed $c_s(T,φ)$. The thesis also functions as a reference manual for PTtools. The framework has been tested with the constant sound speed model, in which the sound speed is a different constant in each phase. The sound speed has been shown to have a significant effect on the resulting gravitational wave spectrum, especially when changing the sound speed results in a change in the type of the solution. This has laid the groundwork for simulating cosmological phase transitions with realistic equations of state. This will result in in gravitational wave spectra that can be used in the LISA data analysis pipeline to search for the existence and parameters of a first-order phase transition in the early universe."}

A small portion of the ATCA data was previously used to determine a time delay and our result is consistent with the previous value, but with an uncertainty that is smaller by more than a factor of two. The long time-baseline of the monitoring reveals that the flux density ratio is smoothly varying on a time-scale of years, an effect which we attribute to millilensing by massive objects (>>1 M_sun) in the lensing galaxy. Image A is unpolarized in the VLA monitoring, but VLBI observations show that this is partly due to beam dilution by an unpolarized counter-jet that is only present in that image. Based on the identification of this feature as a counter-jet, we conclude that its unexpected prominence in image A is a consequence of lensing and that more detailed modelling is required in order to reconcile the VLBI morphology of each image."}

While many fitting functions and emulators exist to model the matter power spectrum, their input parameters are not directly observable. However, recent studies using hydrodynamical simulations have identified a promising correlation between the gas content of halos and changes to the matter power spectrum from feedback. Building on these findings, we create the first fully data-driven power spectrum emulator. We utilize the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect, a secondary anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background, as a tracer of free electrons in and around halos. We train a neural network to learn the mapping between the suppression of the matter power spectrum and the shape of the kSZ power spectrum extracted with a radial velocity template. We train and validate our algorithm using the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamical simulations, which encompasses a wide range of feedback models. Our emulator can reconstruct the matter power spectrum at the sub-percent level for scales $k\\leq 5\\;h/$Mpc and $0.2\\leq z \\leq 1.25$ directly from the data. Our model is robust and retains percent-level accuracy even for feedback models and cosmological parameter values not seen during training (except in a few extreme cases drastically different from the fiducial model). Due to its robustness, our algorithm offers a new way to identify the sources of suppression in the matter power spectrum, breaking the degeneracies between baryonic feedback and new physics. Finally, we present a forecast for reconstruction of the matter power spectrum combining maps of the microwave background anisotropies from a Simons Observatory-like experiment and galaxy catalogs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument."}

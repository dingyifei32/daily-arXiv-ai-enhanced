A cosmological interpretation of this signal\ncorresponds to absorption of 21 cm photons by neutral hydrogen at $z \\sim 17$.\nThe large depth of the signal has been shown to require an excess radio\nbackground above the CMB and/or non-standard cooling processes in the IGM.\nHere, we explore the plausibility of a scenario in which the EDGES signal is\nback-lit by an excess radio background sourced from a population of radio-loud\nAGN at high redshift. These AGN could also explain the unexpected abundance of\nUV-bright objects observed at $z > 10$ by JWST. We find that producing enough\nradio photons to explain the EDGES depth requires that nearly all high-$z$\nUV-bright objects down to $M_{\\mathrm{UV}} \\gtrsim -15$ are radio-loud AGN and\nthat the UV density of such objects declines by at most 1.5 orders of magnitude\nbetween $z = $10 and 20. In addition, the fraction of X-ray photons escaping\nthese objects must be $\\lesssim 1\\%$ of their expected intrinsic production\nrate to prevent the absorption signal being washed out by early IGM\npre-heating. Reproducing the sharp boundaries of the absorption trough and its\nflat bottom requires that the UV luminosity function, the fraction of UV light\nproduced by AGN, and the X-ray escape fraction have fine-tuned redshift\ndependence.

Observations with RXTE have shown that the strongest\nX-ray variability appears in the transition from/to the flaring state. During\nthis transition, it has been proposed that two particular types of\nquasi-periodic oscillations might be connected with the ejection of the\nso-called ultra-relativistic flows. In this paper, we present an analysis of\nthe first NICER observations of Sco X-1 obtained during a multi-wavelenght\ncampaign conducted in February 2019, in order to characterise the properties of\nQPOs as the system evolves through its various accretion states. We compute a\nlight-curve and a Hardness-Intensity diagram to track the evolution of the\nsource spectral properties, while we investigate the X-ray time variability\nwith a Dynamical Power Density Spectrum. To trace the temporal evolution of\nQPOs, we segment the dataset into shorter, continuous intervals, and compute\nand fit the averaged PDS for each interval. Our analysis shows that the overall\nbehaviour of the source is consistent with the literature; strong QPOs around 6\nHz are detected on the normal branch, while transitions to/from the flaring\nbranch -- occurring over timescales of a few hundreds of seconds -- are\ncharacterised by rapid, weaker quasi-periodic variability reaching frequencies\nup to 15 Hz. Despite limited statistical significance, we also identify faint,\ntransient timing features above 20 Hz, occasionally coexisting with the\nprominent 6 Hz QPOs.

We find that VHE emission from weaker afterglows, such as those\nfound in short GRBs, can be affected by such seed photons, with the kilonova\nseed photons mitigating the loss of synchrotron photons on the VHE emission\nwhen afterglow parameters are varied. We also find that VHE emission in\nstructured jets, due to weaker synchrotron emission at their wings, can also\nbenefit from this supply of seed photons, especially when viewed off-axis.

In this study, we\ninvestigate the jet structure of M84, a nearby radio galaxy and a\nrepresentative LLAGN, to probe jet collimation properties in a low-accretion\nregime. Utilizing astrometric phase-referencing observations from the Very Long\nBaseline Array (VLBA), supplemented by archival Very Large Array (VLA) data, we\ntrace the jet geometry of M84 over a broad range of scales, from approximately\n10^2 to 10^7 Schwarzschild radii (rs).

However, the inherent\nsparsity of these measurements raises concerns regarding the feasibility of\nthis approach. We assessed the achievable accuracy of UHECR backtracking using\nmock sparse local GMF data derived from the Jansson & Farrar 2012 (JF12) GMF\nmodel and mock UHECR events. We created mock UHECR datasets that trace back\nwithin a 3 degree angular range from the galaxy M82 (a hypothesized UHECR\nsource), and we investigated the impact on such backtracking attempts of\nvarying GMF measurement sparsity and of varying GMF strength, which we emulated\nby rescaling the strength of the ordered components of the JF12 model. We found\nthat: (a) for an average GMF strength of $1\\mu G$, satisfactory backtracking\nresults for magnetic rigidities of $10^{20}$ eV can be obtained even with very\nsparse measurements ($ \\sim 1600$ pc); (b) when the average GMF strength is\nsignificantly increased ($\\sim$ factor of 10) the accuracy of backtracking\nbreaks down at measurement spacings of 400 pc. These findings emphasize on one\nhand that sparsity is not an automatic deal-breaker for the utility of local\nGMF measurements in UHECR backtracking. On the other hand, we also confirm that\nimportant challenges remain on the path from sparse local GMF measurements to\nprecise charge-particle astronomy, especially in directions of high-strength\nordered magnetic fields.

The number, strength, and\nduration of these pulses can lead to shell collisions that produce\nshock-powered transients, potentially explaining some of the most luminous\nevents, such as superluminous supernovae, and other rare transients. Rapid\nprogenitor rotation lowers the PPISN mass threshold and influences the\ndynamics, energetics, and chemical composition of PPISN-driven pulses. In this\nstudy, we computed 1D evolutionary models of massive, rotating PPISN progenitor\nstars with zero-age main-sequence masses of 85-140 solar masses and solar\nmetallicity and 10% solar metallicity. Our analysis reveals strong correlations\nbetween PPISN ejected mass and total energy as well as between ejected mass and\npeak ejected shell velocity. Additionally, moderate correlations indicate that\nhigher initial PPISN progenitor mass leads to greater mass ejection and energy\nrelease, while negative correlations show that rapid rotation appears to reduce\nmass ejection and kinetic energy of the shells. Subsequent pulses lead to\nhydrogen-poor, carbon- and oxygen-enriched ejected shells, indicating the\neffect of rotationally-induced chemical mixing in PPISN-driven episodic mass\nloss with implications for their transients. We model the light curve and\nsynthetic spectra that arise from the collision of two H-poor shells for one of\nour models using the radiation transport code SuperLite.

In particular, the magnetic flux\ntransport in the presence of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is an\nessential factor for understanding star formation. The theory of Reconnection\nDiffusion (RD), based on statistics of Alfv\\'enic turbulence, predicts a\ndependence of the diffusion coefficient of the magnetic field on the Alfv\\'enic\nMach number $M_A$. However, this theory does not consider the effects of\ncompressibility which are important in the regime of supersonic MHD turbulence.\nIn this work, we measure the diffusion coefficient of magnetic fields in\nsub-Alfv\\'enic MHD turbulence, with different sonic Mach numbers $M_S$. We\nperform numerical simulations of forced turbulence in periodic domains from the\nincompressible limit to the supersonic regime. We introduce two methods to\nextract the diffusion coefficient, based on the analysis of tracer particles.\nOur results confirm the RD assumption regarding the correspondence between the\ndiffusion of magnetic field and that of fluid Lagrangian particles. The\nmeasured diffusion rate provided by incompressible turbulence agrees with the\nsuppression predicted by the RD theory in the presence of strong magnetic\nfields: $D \\propto M_A^3$.

However, multiwavelength observations of compact\nstars in the last 50 years have not yet led to an unambiguous SQS\nidentification. This article explores whether SQSs could form in the supernova\n(SN) explosion of an evolved star (e.g., carbon-oxygen, or Wolf-Rayet)\noccurring in a binary with the companion being a neutron star (NS). The\ncollapse of the iron core of the evolved star generates a newborn NS and the SN\nexplosion. Part of the ejected matter accretes onto the NS companion as well as\nonto the newborn NS via matter fallback. The accretion occurs at hypercritical\n(highly super-Eddington) rates, transferring mass and angular momentum to the\nstars. We present numerical simulations of this scenario and demonstrate that\nthe density increase in the NS interiors during the accretion process may\ninduce quark matter deconfinement, suggesting the possibility of SQS formation.\nWe discuss the astrophysical conditions under which such a transformation may\noccur and possible consequences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7206\u70b8\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u5947\u5f02\u5938\u514b\u661f\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5947\u5f02\u5938\u514b\u661f\uff08SQSs\uff09\u81ea20\u4e16\u7eaa70\u5e74\u4ee3\u5c31\u88ab\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u81f3\u4eca\u672a\u88ab\u660e\u786e\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7206\u70b8\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u8d28\u5438\u79ef\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3aSQSs\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7206\u70b8\u540e\u7269\u8d28\u5438\u79ef\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9ad8\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u4e0b\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5938\u514b\u7269\u8d28\u89e3\u7981\u95ed\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9ad8\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u4e0b\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u53ef\u80fd\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5938\u514b\u7269\u8d28\u89e3\u7981\u95ed\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301SQSs\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aSQSs\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5176\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

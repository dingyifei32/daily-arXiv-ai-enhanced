However, very little is still known\nabout the astrophysical $\\bar{\\nu}:\\nu$\n  ratio. The only prior measurement is the recent, single Glashow event seen by\nIceCube. Understanding the astrophysical $\\bar{\\nu}:\\nu$\n  ratio has a bearing on multiple questions, including the astrophysical\nspectral shape and neutrino production mechanisms. This analysis uses a new\napproach to measuring the astrophysical muon $\\bar{\\nu}:\\nu$ ratio at various\nenergies. It uses inelasticity, the fraction of the initial neutrino energy\ncarried away by the hadronic shower. Inelasticity probes the $\\bar{\\nu}:\\nu$\n  ratio due to the fact that at energies below roughly 100 TeV, valence quarks\ndominate in deep inelastic scattering interactions, leading to different\nneutrino and antineutrino inelasticities and cross-sections. We use 10.3 years\nof IceCube data consisting of starting tracks at energies between 1 TeV and 1\nPeV with a self-veto selection that enhances astrophysical event purity in the\ndown-going direction.

Its success depends critically on obtaining\nhighly accurate mean redshifts for ensembles of galaxies $n(z)$ in all\ntomographic bins, essential for deriving robust cosmological constraints.\nHowever, photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) suffer from systematic biases\narising from various sources of uncertainty. To address these challenges, we\nutilised self-organising maps (SOMs) with mock samples resembling the Euclid\nWide Survey (EWS), to validate Euclid's uncertainty requirement of\n$|\\Delta\\langle z \\rangle| = \\langle z_{\\text{est}} \\rangle - \\langle z \\rangle\n\\leq 0.002 (1+z)$ per tomographic bin, assuming DR3-level data.

In contrast, the redshift tomography on the\nphoto-$z$s of the EWS-like sample yields superior results, with eight out of\nten bins [$0 < z\\leq 2.5$] meeting the Euclid requirement. To enhance the\nrealism of our study, we morph our calibration sample to mimic the C3R2 survey\nin incremental steps. In this context, a maximum of six out of ten bins meet\nthe requirement, strongly advocating the adoption of a redshift tomography\ndefined by the photo-$z$s of individual galaxies rather than the commonly used\nmean spec-$z$ of SOM cells.

To explore\nthis further, we selected CTA 102 for which existing literature presents mixed\nevidence regarding the presence of a jet geometry break. We investigated the\njet width profile of CTA 102 to study the possible transition changes in the\njet, thereby improving the understanding of connection between Bondi radius and\njet transition. We used multi-frequency VLBA images of CTA 102 at 2, 5, and 8\n(single epoch), and 15, 22 and 43 GHz (stacked).

The absence of\ndiscernible structural break around the Bondi radius implies that the physical\nconditions associated with the radius alone are insufficient to explain the jet\ncollimation behaviour. On the other hand, we observe oscillatory features in\nthe jet width profile, suggesting the influence of additional physical\nprocesses beyond gravitational confinement.

Taking into account\nthe DF of DM, we employ the detailed binary evolution code MESA to model the\nevolution of a large number of IMBH-MS binaries. Our simulation shows that the\nDF of DM can drive those IMBH-MS binaries to evolve toward low-frequency GW\nsources for a low donor-star mass, a high spike index, or a short initial\norbital period. When the spike index $\\gamma=1.60$, those IMBH-MS binaries with\ndonor-star masses of $1.0-3.4~ M_{\\odot}$ and initial orbital periods of\n$0.65-16.82~ \\rm days$ could potentially evolve into visible LISA sources\nwithin a distance of $10~\\rm kpc$. The DF of DM can enlarge the initial\nparameter space and prolong the bifurcation periods. In the low-frequency GW\nsource stage, the X-ray luminosities of those IMBH X-ray binaries are $\\sim\n10^{35}-10^{36}~\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}$, hence they are ideal multimessenger objects."}

Our framework\ndemonstrates how Compton scattering within the disk plasma generates charge\nseparation, creating a capacitor-like system stabilized by the equilibrium\nbetween radiation pressure and electrostatic forces. We detail the discharge\nprocess through destabilizing mechanisms in this capacitor, resulting in\nradiative emission. We compare our model's prediction on radiation signatures\nwith observational data, using FRB2018725A as an example to obtain key\nquantitative relationships. Additionally, we estimate the total charge buildup\nvia Compton scattering for a stellar-mass black hole, constrained by the\nbest-fit between our model and observations, and determine the corresponding\nelectron density in the accretion disk for this mechanism to operate."}

In this work, we test this assumption by\nexplicitly simulating the radial migration of BH pairs in AGN disks under\ndifferent torque prescriptions, including thermal effects and the switch to\nType II migration. We quantify where and when binaries form as a function of\nsupermassive BH (SMBH) mass, disk viscosity, and migrating BH mass. We find\nthat while the majority of pair-up events occur near migration traps, a\nsubstantial fraction takes place elsewhere in the disk, particularly for\nhigh-viscosity disks ($\\alpha=0.1-0.4$) and SMBHs with mass above a threshold\nof $10^{7.5}$ solar masses, where differential migration is most efficient. The\ninclusion of thermal torques favors pair-up in outer locations of the disk and\nfacilitates rapid pair-up. We also investigate hierarchical BBH formation,\nshowing that higher-generation pair-ups are more tightly clustered around trap\nlocations. Our results provide realistic prescriptions for BBH pair-up\nlocations and timescales, highlighting the limitations of assuming fixed BBH\nformation sites."}

Jane Arthur", "Paz Beniamini", "Jonathan Granot"], "title": "On the Efficiency of Producing Gamma-Ray Bursts from Isolated Population III Stars", "comment": "Submitted to MNRAS, comments are welcome", "summary": "The rate of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) from isolated Pop III stars\nis not well known, as it depends on our poor understanding of their initial\nmass function (IMF), rotation rates, stellar evolution, and mass loss. A\nsub-population of massive ($M_{\\rm ZAMS}\\gtrsim20M_\\odot$) Pop III stars is\nexpected to suffer core-collapse and launch a relativistic jet that would power\na GRB. In the collapsar scenario, a key requirement is that the pre-supernova\nstar imparts sufficient angular momentum to the remnant black hole to form an\naccretion disc and launch a relativistic jet, which demands rapid initial\nrotation of the progenitor star and suppression of line-driven mass loss during\nits chemically homogeneous evolution. Here we explore a grid of stellar\nevolution models of Pop III stars with masses $20\\leq M_{\\rm ZAMS}/M_\\odot \\leq\n100$, which are initially rotating with surface angular velocities $0.6\\leq\n\\Omega_0/\\Omega_{\\rm crit}\\leq 0.9$, where centrifugally-driven mass loss\nensues for $\\Omega>\\Omega_{\\rm crit}$. Realistic accretion and jet propagation\nmodels are used to derive the initial black hole masses and spins, and jet\nbreakout times for these stars. The GRB production efficiency is obtained over\na phase space comprising progenitor initial mass, rotation, and wind\nefficiency. For modest wind efficiency of $\\eta_{\\rm wind}=0.45-0.35$, the Pop\nIII GRB production efficiency is $\\eta_{\\rm\nGRB}\\sim10^{-5}-3\\times10^{-4}\\,M_\\odot^{-1}$, respectively, for a top-heavy\nIMF. This yields an observable all-sky equivalent rate of $\\sim2-40\\,{\\rm\nyr}^{-1}$ by \\textit{Swift}, with 75\\% of the GRBs located at $z\\lesssim8$. If\nthe actual observed rate is much lower, then this would imply $\\eta_{\\rm\nwind}>0.45$, which leads to significant loss of mass and angular momentum that\nrenders isolated Pop III stars incapable of producing GRBs and favours a binary\nscenario instead."}

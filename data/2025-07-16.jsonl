In this uniquely data-rich regime,\nwe take initial steps towards a more tailored IA modelling approach by building\na library of IA measurements across colour, luminosity, stellar mass, and\nredshift. We map the dependence between galaxy type -- in terms of rest-frame\ncolour, strength of the 4000 Angstrom break, and specific star formation rate\n-- and IA amplitude; the bluest galaxies have an alignment consistent with\nzero, across low (0.05<z<0.5) and high (0.8<z<1.55) redshifts. In order to\nconstruct cosmic shear samples that are minimally impacted by IA but maintain\nmaximum sample size and statistical power, we map the dependence of alignment\nwith colour purity. Red, quenched galaxies are strongly aligned and the\namplitude of the signal increases with luminosity, which is tightly correlated\nwith stellar mass in our catalogues. For DESI galaxies between 0<z<1.5, trends\nin luminosity and colour alone are sufficient to explain the alignments we\nmeasure -- with no need for an explicit redshift dependence. In a companion\npaper (Jeffrey et al., in prep), we perform detailed modelling of the IA\nsignals with significant detections, including model comparison. Finally, to\ndirect efforts for future IA measurements, we juxtapose the\ncolour-magnitude-redshift coverage of existing IA measurements against modern\nand future lensing surveys."}

We also find significant evidence for\nvariability of the progenitor candidate in the years prior to core-collapse. SN\n2024abfo is the least luminous SN IIb with a direct progenitor detections. At\nlate times the r-band light curve decays more slowly than the comparison SNe,\nwhich may be due to increased gamma-ray trapping. Similar to SN 2008ax, SN\n2024abfo does not show a prominent double-peaked light curve. Our semi-analytic\nlight curve modelling shows that this may be due to a very low mass of hydrogen\nin the outer envelope. Spectrally, SN 2024abfo is most similar to SN 2008ax at\nearly times while at later times (80 days) it appears to show persistent Halpha\nabsorption compared to the comparison sample. We prefer a binary system to\nexplain the supernova and its progenitor, although we are unable to rule out\nsingle-star models. We recommend late-time observations to search for a binary\ncompanion and signatures of CSM-interaction. The absence of these features\nwould support the hypothesis that SN 2024abfo resulted from a system which\nunderwent a period of binary mass transfer well before (1000 yr) the explosion,\nresulting in a low-mass hydrogen-rich envelope."}

From the properties of the binary system and the UHE radiation detected\nby HAWC, we used analytical tools to investigate how these properties constrain\nthe emission and acceleration regions, namely the role of synchrotron losses,\nparticle confinement, and the accelerated particle spectrum, and propose an\nacceleration scenario that can relax the derived constraints. The modest target\ndensities for hadronic processes and the overall gamma-ray orbital variability\nfavor inverse Compton scattering of ultraviolet photons from the massive\ncompanion star by highly relativistic electrons. The acceleration of the\nhighest energy electrons implies a constraint on synchrotron cooling in the\nacceleration region, which can set an upper limit on its magnetic field.\nMoreover, the detected variability requires very strong particle confinement in\nboth the acceleration and emission regions, which sets a lower limit on their\nmagnetic fields that is barely consistent with the synchrotron cooling\nconstraint from acceleration. Synchrotron losses may be higher in the emitting\nregion if it is separated from the accelerator, but this requires a very hard\nparticle injection spectrum.

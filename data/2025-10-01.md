TL;DR: 2025年宇宙学张力会议报告，评估了哈勃常数H₀超过6σ的显著差异、S₈张力和新兴异常，这些现象挑战了ΛCDM标准宇宙学模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估宇宙学标准模型中的裂缝，探索理论和观测上的补救措施，特别是在哈勃常数H₀差异达到6σ、新数据使张力更加稳健的背景下。

Method: 通过2025年宇宙学张力会议，汇集宇宙学界集体评估，分析DESI、JWST、ACT等新设施的高精度数据。

Result: 哈勃常数H₀差异已超过6σ，S₈张力虽然较弱但仍重要，动态暗能量和中微子物理等新兴异常成为超越ΛCDM物理学的潜在迹象。

Conclusion: 宇宙学标准模型面临严峻挑战，新数据使现有张力更加稳健，同时开启了探索早期和晚期宇宙的新窗口，需要超越ΛCDM的新物理学解释。

Abstract: The ``Tensions in Cosmology'' series of conferences has been established as
one of the main venues where the cosmological community collectively assesses
the cracks in the concordance model and explores possible theoretical and
observational remedies. The 2025 edition, held once again in Corfu, Greece,
came at a crucial time: the Hubble constant $H_0$ discrepancy has now exceeded
$6\sigma$, and new high-precision data from DESI, JWST, ACT, and other
facilities have made this tension more robust while opening new windows on the
early and late Universe. The $S_8$ tension, though milder and survey-dependent,
remains an important probe of late-time structure formation, while emerging
anomalies involving dynamical dark energy and neutrino physics are gaining
increasing attention as potential signs of physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM. Here we
provide a report on the meeting and an update on the state of the tensions in
2025, highlighting progress since the pioneering 2022 event.

### [2] [The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey. Detection of shock-heated gas beyond the halo boundary into the accretion region](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25317)

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 通过对680个星系团的堆叠分析，在SRG/eROSITA全天巡天数据中探测到延伸到2r200m（约4.5 Mpc）的显著X射线信号，揭示了星系团外围热气体的分布特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 星系团尺度晕外围的热气体，延伸到维里半径附近及之外的吸积区域，是大尺度宇宙结构中研究最少的重子成分之一。

Method: 使用SRG/eROSITA全天巡天前两年的数据，对680个位于西银半球星系团进行堆叠分析，并结合IllustrisTNG模拟研究气体分布。

Result: 在r200m半径处气体密度为2.5e-5 cm^-3，对应重子过密度30；积分到r200m的气体分数达到宇宙重子分数的90%；模拟显示沿宇宙纤维方向的气体密度高于空洞方向。

Conclusion: r200m是宇宙纤维连接到星系团的近似半径；观测样本中的反馈过程比IllustrisTNG模型更有效地将气体分布到大半径区域。

Abstract: The hot gas in the outskirts of galaxy cluster-sized halos, extending around
and beyond the virial radius into nearby accretion regions, remains among one
of the least explored baryon components of large-scale cosmic structure. We
present a stacking analysis of 680 galaxy clusters located in the western
Galactic hemisphere, using data from the first two years of the SRG/eROSITA
All-Sky Survey. The stacked X-ray surface brightness profile reveals a
statistically significant signal extending out to 2r200m (~4.5 Mpc). The
best-fit surface brightness profile is well described by a combination of terms
describing orbiting and infalling gas, with a transition occurring around
r200m. At this radius, the best-fit gas density is 2.5e-5 cm^-3, corresponding
to a baryon overdensity of 30. By integrating the gas density profile out to
r200m, we infer a gas fraction of 90% of the universal baryon fraction with the
assumption of a typical halo concentration, indicating the completeness of the
baryon budget within large radii. Additionally, we examine the hot gas
distribution in massive clusters in the IllustrisTNG simulations from the halo
center to the accretion region. This analysis reveals differences in radial gas
profiles depending on whether the direction probes voids or nearby cosmic
filaments. Beyond r200m, the density profile along the filament direction
exceeds that along the void direction. This pattern aligns with the observed
transition radius between the one-halo and two-halo terms, suggesting that
r200m is the approximate radius marking the location at which cosmic filaments
connect to galaxy clusters. Meanwhile, the comparisons of the gas density
profile and gas fraction profile between the observation and the IllustrisTNG
simulation suggest that the feedback processes in the stacking sample are more
efficient than the IllustrisTNG model in distributing gas to large radii.

### [3] [AVISM: Algorithm for Void Identification in coSMology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25329)
*Óscar Monllor-Berbegal,David Vallés-Pérez,Susana Planelles,Vicent Quilis*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 提出了AVISM算法，一种结合几何和动力学信息识别宇宙空洞的新方法，能够处理模拟和观测数据，并重建空洞的完整3D结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 宇宙空洞是理解宇宙大尺度结构的关键元素，对于约束宇宙学参数、研究结构形成和演化至关重要，同时可作为研究星系形成的纯净实验室。需要准确一致地识别空洞。

Method: AVISM算法结合几何和动力学信息识别空洞区域，采用分层合并过程重建空洞的完整3D结构，不假设先验形状，可在不同分辨率级别重复处理。

Result: 通过数值测试验证代码能力，与DIVE和ZOBOV等先进空洞查找器进行统计和一对一比较，展示了处理真实星系巡天数据的能力。

Conclusion: 成功开发了新的空洞查找算法，能够生成具有复杂边界且不假设先验形状的空洞目录，并描述空洞子结构。

Abstract: Cosmic voids are key elements in our understanding of the large-scale
structure of the Universe. They are crucial to constrain cosmological
parameters, understand the structure formation and evolution of our Universe,
and they could also be pristine laboratories for studying galaxy formation
without all the hassle due to environmental effects. Thus, the ability to
accurately and consistently identify voids, both in numerical simulations and
in observations, becomes mandatory. We present Algorithm for Void
Identification in coSMology (AVISM), a new void finder for analysing both
cosmological simulation outputs and observational galaxy catalogues. In the
first case, the code should handle raw particle or cell data, dark matter halos
or synthetic galaxy catalogues. In the case of observational data, the code
should be coupled with external tools providing with the required dynamical
information to apply the algorithm. A set of numerical tests designed to assess
the code's capabilities are carried out. AVISM's performance is also compared,
both statistically and on a one-to-one basis, with the DIVE and ZOBOV
state-of-the-art void finders using as input a dark matter halo catalogue from
a large-volume cosmological simulation. An application to a galaxy survey is
provided to demonstrate the code's ability to handle real data. We have
designed a new void finder algorithm that combines geometrical and dynamical
information to identify void regions plus a hierarchical merging process to
reconstruct the whole 3D structure of the void. The outcome of this process is
a void catalogue with complex boundaries without assuming a prior shape. This
process can be repeated at different levels of resolution using finer grids,
leading to a list of voids-in-voids and a proper description of void
substructure.

TL;DR: 该论文运用突变理论研究冷暗物质相空间中的奇点，分析宇宙网中薄饼结构的形状演化及其向晕和纤维的转变过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解冷暗物质在相空间中形成的宇宙网结构，特别是薄饼结构的形状特征如何影响其演化为晕和纤维的过程。

Method: 使用二维突变理论分析相空间奇点周围的运动，建立薄饼结构的解析模型，包括高阶修正项如曲率和C到S形状转变尺度，并采用高斯统计和泽尔多维奇流假设计算可观测特征的分布。

Result: 研究发现：更多薄饼演化为纤维；演化为晕的薄饼曲率更大；薄饼主要呈C形；壳层交叉具有高度各向异性。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展到三维，用于检验宇宙网观测结果并寻找相应尺度的非高斯性特征。

Abstract: Cold dark matter (CDM) can be thought of as a 2D (or 3D) sheet of particles
in 4D (or 6D) phase-space due to its negligible velocity dispersion. The
large-scale structure, also called the cosmic web, is thus a result of the
topology of the CDM manifold. Initial crossing of particle trajectories occurs
at the critical points of this manifold, forming singularities that seed most
of the collapsed structures. The cosmic web can thus be characterized using the
points of singularities. In this context, we employ catastrophe theory in 2D to
study the motion around such singularities and analytically model the shape of
the emerging structures, particularly the pancakes, which later evolve into
halos and filaments-the building blocks of the 2D web. We compute higher-order
corrections to the shape of the pancakes, including properties such as the
curvature and the scale of transition from their C to S shape. Using Gaussian
statistics (with the assumption of Zeldovich flow) for our model parameters, we
also compute the distributions of observable features related to the shape of
pancakes and their variation across halo and filament populations in 2D
cosmologies. We find that a larger fraction of pancakes evolve into filaments,
they are more curved if they are to evolve into halos, are dominantly C-shaped,
and the nature of shell-crossing is highly anisotropic. Extending this work to
3D will allow testing of predictions against actual observations of the cosmic
web and searching for signatures of non-Gaussianity at corresponding scales.

### [5] [Updated observational constraints on $φ$CDM dynamical dark energy cosmological models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25812)
*Chan-Gyung Park,Bharat Ratra*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 该研究使用普朗克2018年CMB数据和非CMB数据对具有逆幂律势的标量场暗能量模型(φCDM)进行约束，发现数据轻微支持演化暗能量而非宇宙常数，但ΛCDM模型仍是最佳拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究标量场暗能量模型(φCDM)是否能比宇宙常数模型更好地描述观测数据，特别是解决哈勃常数张力和CMB透镜异常问题。

Method: 使用普朗克2018年CMB温度、偏振和透镜功率谱，结合重子声学振荡、Ia型超新星、哈勃参数和增长率测量等非CMB数据，约束φCDM和φCDM+AL模型。

Result: 标量场参数α在φCDM模型中为0.055±0.041，在φCDM+AL模型中为0.095±0.056，轻微支持演化暗能量。哈勃常数H0=67.55+0.53-0.46 km/s/Mpc，与一些局部测量一致但与其他存在张力。AL=1.105±0.037，显示CMB数据存在过度平滑。

Conclusion: 虽然ΛCDM模型仍是最佳拟合，但当前数据为温和演化的精质类动力学暗能量留下了可能性，φCDM+AL模型略微更受青睐。

Abstract: We present updated observational constraints on the spatially flat $\phi$CDM
model, where dark energy is described by a minimally coupled scalar field
$\phi$ with an inverse power-law potential $V=V_0 \phi^{-\alpha}$. Using Planck
2018 CMB temperature, polarization (P18), and lensing power spectra (lensing),
along with a compilation of non-CMB data including baryon acoustic oscillation,
type Ia supernova, Hubble parameter, and growth rate measurements, we constrain
$\phi$CDM and $\phi$CDM+$A_L$ models where $A_L$ is the CMB lensing consistency
parameter. The scalar field parameter $\alpha$, which governs dark energy
dynamics, is more tightly constrained by non-CMB data than by CMB data alone.
For the full dataset, we obtain $\alpha = 0.055 \pm 0.041$ in the $\phi$CDM
model and $\alpha = 0.095 \pm 0.056$ in the $\phi$CDM+$A_L$ model, mildly
favoring evolving dark energy over a cosmological constant by $1.3\sigma$ and
$1.7\sigma$. The Hubble constant is $H_0=67.55_{-0.46}^{+0.53}$ km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$ in the $\phi$CDM model, consistent with median statistics and some
local determinations, but in tension with other local determinations. The
constraints for matter density and clustering amplitude ($\Omega_m = 0.3096 \pm
0.0055$, $\sigma_8 = 0.8013_{-0.0067}^{+0.0077}$) of the flat $\phi$CDM model
statistically agree with $\Lambda$CDM model values. Allowing $A_L$ to vary
reduces tensions between CMB and non-CMB data, although we find $A_L = 1.105
\pm 0.037$, $2.8\sigma$ higher than unity, consistent with the excess smoothing
seen in Planck data. Model comparison using AIC and DIC indicates that the
$\phi$CDM model provides a fit comparable to $\Lambda$CDM, with the
$\phi$CDM+$A_L$ slightly preferred. Overall, while the $\Lambda$CDM model
remains an excellent fit, current data leave open the possibility of mildly
evolving quintessence-like dynamical dark energy.

### [6] [Searching for Dark Structures: A Comparison of Weak Lensing Convergence Maps and Lensing-Weighted Galaxy Density Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25836)
*Soojin Kim,Ho Seong Hwang,Niall Jeffrey*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 通过比较弱引力透镜推断的暗物质分布与观测到的星系分布，识别出22个暗物质密度高于星系密度的区域，最终筛选出7个最可能的暗结构候选者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别具有高暗物质-星系密度比的暗结构，为暗物质映射研究提供有价值的测试平台。

Method: 使用暗能量巡天第3年数据的弱透镜收敛图，构建z≲1.0的星系收敛图，比较两种分布以识别密度差异区域。

Result: 发现22个暗物质密度过高的区域，经过仔细检查后筛选出7个最可能的暗结构候选者。

Conclusion: 该方法对未来大规模弱透镜巡天研究暗结构非常有用，如欧几里得任务、LSST和南希·格雷斯·罗曼空间望远镜。

Abstract: We present the result of a comparison between the dark matter distribution
inferred from weak gravitational lensing and the observed galaxy distribution
to identify dark structures with a high dark matter-to-galaxy density ratio. To
do this, we use weak lensing convergence maps from the Dark Energy Survey Year
3 data, and construct corresponding galaxy convergence maps at $z\lesssim1.0$,
representing projected galaxy number density fluctuations weighted by lensing
efficiency. The two maps show overall agreement. However, we could identify 22
regions where the dark matter density exhibits an excess compared to the galaxy
density. After carefully examining the survey depths and proximity to survey
boundaries, we select seven of the most probable candidates for dark
structures. This sample provides valuable testbeds for further investigations
into dark matter mapping. Moreover, our method will be very useful for future
studies of dark structures as large-scale weak-lensing surveys become
available, such as the $\textit{Euclid}$ mission, the Vera C. Rubin
Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), and the Nancy Grace Roman
Space Telescope.

### [7] [Excursion Set Approach to Primordial Black Holes: Cloud-in-Cloud and Mass Function Revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25871)
*Ashu Kushwaha,Teruaki Suyama*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了Press-Schechter形式主义在原始黑洞形成中的应用，通过随机游走理论证明了原始黑洞情况与暗物质晕形成不同，是非马尔可夫过程，澄清了传统'修正因子2'在PBH计算中的适用性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Press-Schechter形式主义在原始黑洞丰度计算中经常使用暗物质晕形成中的'修正因子2'，但其有效性一直存在争议。本文旨在通过随机游走理论框架澄清这一模糊性。

Method: 在随机游走框架下重新构建PS方法，将平滑密度对比视为随平滑尺度变化的随机过程，通过数值方法分解随机运动的不同贡献分量。

Result: 数值计算证实暗物质晕形成中两个随机运动分量的贡献确实相等，验证了修正因子的合理性；但原始黑洞情况下这种相等关系不再成立，必须同时包含两个贡献才能确保质量函数的正定性。

Conclusion: 原始黑洞形成过程本质上是非马尔可夫的，传统修正因子在PBH计算中不适用，这为原始黑洞丰度计算建立了更坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: The abundance and mass function of primordial black holes (PBHs) are often
estimated using the Press-Schechter (PS) formalism. In the case of halo
formation, the PS formalism suffers from the miscounting of regions collapsing
into halos, known as the cloud-in-cloud problem, which is usually corrected by
introducing a multiplicative `fudge factor 2'. By analogy, this factor has
sometimes been applied to PBH calculations, although its validity has remained
unsettled. We reformulate the PS approach for PBHs within the excursion-set
framework, where the smoothed density contrast undergoes a stochastic random
walk as the smoothing scale varies and collapse is identified with the first
threshold crossing. While the halo case is described by a Markovian process, we
show that the PBH case is non-Markovian, even when the sharp-k filter Window
function is adopted. Decomposing the total collapse probability into two
distinct components of the stochastic motion, we numerically confirm that their
contributions are exactly equal in the case of halo formation, justifying the
fudge factor. For PBHs, however, we demonstrate that this equality no longer
holds, and consistent inclusion of both contributions is essential to ensure a
positive-definite mass function. Our results clarify the origin of the
ambiguity surrounding the fudge factor and establish a robust theoretical
foundation for PBH abundance calculations.

### [8] [The impact of higher-order distortions on the precise measurement of weak gravitational lensing shear and flexion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25990)
*Yuki Okura,Toshifumi Futamase*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 研究高阶扭曲对弱引力透镜剪切和弯曲测量的影响，发现忽略这些扭曲会引入几个百分点的系统误差，但通过同时测量高阶扭曲可以将误差降至1%以下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高阶扭曲对弱引力透镜剪切和弯曲精确测量的影响，因为这些效应在传统分析中常被忽略但可能引入显著系统误差。

Method: 定义广义高阶扭曲并制定测量方法，使用多个透镜模型分析这些扭曲对剪切和弯曲测量的影响。

Result: 忽略高阶扭曲会在剪切和弯曲测量中引入几个百分点的系统误差，同时测量高阶扭曲可将系统误差降至1%以下。

Conclusion: 高阶扭曲效应不可忽视，但通过同时测量这些扭曲可以有效控制测量误差，提高弱引力透镜研究的精度。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of higher-order distortions on the
precise measurement of weak gravitational lensing shear and flexion. We begin
by defining generalized higher-order distortions and outlining methods for
measuring them. Then, using several lens models, we examine how these
distortions affect shear and flexion measurements. Our results show that
neglecting higher-order distortions can introduce systematic errors of a few
percent in both shear and flexion measurements, indicating that these effects
cannot be ignored. Although the strength of these errors depends on factors
such as lensing strength and the size of background sources, we demonstrate
that simultaneous measurement of higher-order distortions can reduce the
systematic errors to below 1% in most cases.

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: ΛsCDM模型通过引入一个额外参数z†（符号切换的宇宙学常数）来扩展标准ΛCDM模型，旨在缓解哈勃张力和S8差异等观测矛盾，同时保持模型的整体一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着高精度数据集的出现，标准ΛCDM模型面临着哈勃张力和S8差异等统计显著性的挑战，需要探索扩展模型来解决这些观测矛盾。

Method: 结合完整的Planck 2018 CMB数据、Pantheon Ia型超新星样本和DESI重子声学振荡测量，对ΛsCDM模型进行全面分析。

Result: ΛsCDM模型不仅更好地拟合了红移z†<2.3的Lyman-α森林数据，还能同时容纳SH0ES的H0测量和最后散射面的角直径距离。DESI初步结果显示与ΛCDM预期存在3.9σ偏差。

Conclusion: ΛsCDM模型有潜力调和多个宇宙学张力，高精度观测将重塑我们对宇宙膨胀历史和暗能量本质的理解。

Abstract: The $\Lambda$CDM model has long served as the cornerstone of modern
cosmology, offering an elegant and successful framework for interpreting a wide
range of cosmological observations. However, the rise of high-precision
datasets has revealed statistically significant tensions, most notably the
Hubble tension and the $S_8$ discrepancy, which challenge the completeness of
this standard model. In this context, we explore the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM
model-an extension of $\Lambda$CDM featuring a single additional parameter,
$z_\dagger$, corresponding to a sign-switching cosmological constant. This
minimal modification aims to alleviate key observational tensions without
compromising the model's overall coherence. Recent findings present in the
literature indicate that the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model not only provides a
better fit to Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data for $z_\dagger < 2.3$, but also
accommodates both the SH0ES measurement of $H_0$ and the angular diameter
distance to the last scattering surface when 2D BAO data are included. We
present a comprehensive analysis combining the full Planck 2018 CMB data, the
Pantheon Type Ia Supernovae sample, and the recently released Baryon Acoustic
Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument
(DESI). Our finding reveal that the Preliminary DESI results, a possible
$3.9\sigma$ deviation from $\Lambda$CDM expectations, reinforce the importance
of exploring such dynamic dark energy frameworks. In sum, our study underscores
the potential of $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM to reconcile multiple cosmological
tensions and sheds light on the role of upcoming high-precision observations in
reshaping our understanding of the universe's expansion history and the nature
of dark energy.

### [10] [The Tidal Torque Theory Revisited: II. Rotational Halo Properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26081)
*Eduard Salvador-Solé,Alberto Manrique*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 本文通过改进峰值模型，考虑了原晕密度轮廓的非均匀性和渐进式塌缩过程，成功解释了暗物质晕的旋转特性，解决了传统潮汐扭矩理论无法解释晕旋转的长期问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的峰值模型和潮汐扭矩理论能够解释暗物质晕的多种性质，但始终无法解释晕的旋转特性，这是该领域存在了50多年的异常现象。

Method: 在Paper I基础上，考虑原晕的实际密度轮廓（向外递减且不均匀）和渐进式塌缩过程（从内向外逐步塌缩并经历合并），详细监测质量和角动量的增长过程。

Result: 模型成功解释了模拟晕的旋转特性，能够重现最终晕的自旋分布以及内部平均比角动量的质量和径向分布。

Conclusion: 通过考虑密度轮廓的非均匀性和渐进式塌缩过程，峰值模型现在能够完全解释暗物质晕的所有观测特性，包括之前无法解释的旋转特性。

Abstract: The peak model of structure formation was built more than fifty years ago
with the aim to address the origin of dark matter halo rotation in the tidal
torque theory (TTT). Paradoxically, it has allowed one to explain and reproduce
all halo properties found in cosmological simulations except their rotation,
which remains to be understood. With the present two Papers we remedy this
anomaly. In Paper I we derived the angular momentum (AM) of protohalos centered
on triaxial peaks of suited scale, taking into account that, to leading order,
their density profile is smooth and homogeneous. Here we use that result to
derive the AM of these objects, accounting for the fact that their actual
density profile is slightly outward decreasing and lumpy so that they do not
collapse monolithically at once, but progressively from inside out, undergoing
mergers during the process. By monitoring in detail their resulting mass and AM
growth, we characterize the spin distribution of final halos and the precise
mass and radial distribution of their inner mean specific AM. The results
obtained explain and reproduce the rotational properties of simulated halos.

*Shouvik Roy Choudhury,Teppei Okumura,Keiichi Umetsu*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 本文研究了一个包含12个参数的宇宙学模型，重点关注非幻影动态暗能量(NPDDE)。通过结合DESI BAO、Planck CMB、CMB透镜、超新星和弱透镜数据，发现3σ+证据表明透镜振幅A_lens>1，表明CMB透镜振幅高于NPDDE模型的预期值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究非幻影动态暗能量模型，这类模型覆盖了流行的单标量场暗能量模型（如Quintessence）的参数空间，旨在探索更真实的暗能量物理机制。

Method: 构建12参数宇宙学模型，包括ΛCDM的6个参数和额外的动态暗能量参数(w₀,wₐ)、透镜振幅缩放(A_lens)、中微子质量总和(∑m_ν)、有效相对论自由度(N_eff)和标量谱指数跑动(α_s)。结合DESI BAO、Planck CMB、CMB透镜、超新星和弱透镜数据进行约束分析。

Result: 使用CMB+BAO+WL和CMB+BAO+SNe+WL组合时，发现3σ+证据表明A_lens>1，即CMB透镜振幅高于NPDDE模型预测的单位值。

Conclusion: 为了容纳现实的quintessence类暗能量模型（而非非物理的幻影暗能量），宇宙学还需要解释相对显著的透镜异常现象。

Abstract: We consider a 12-parameter cosmological model with non-phantom dynamical dark
energy (NPDDE), where non-phantom implies that the equation of state (EoS) of
dark energy (DE), $w(z)\geq-1$ for all redshifts $z$. Thus, the DE EoS covers
the parameter space corresponding to the popular single scalar-field dark
energy models, i.e., Quintessence. The cosmological model comprises 6
parameters of the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, and
additionally the dynamical DE EoS parameters ($w_0$, $w_a$), the scaling of the
lensing amplitude ($A_{\rm lens}$), sum of the neutrino masses ($\sum m_\nu$),
the effective number of non-photon relativistic degrees of freedom ($N_{\rm
eff}$), and the running of the scalar spectral index ($\alpha_s$). We derive
constraints on the parameters by combining the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument (DESI) Data Release (DR) 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO)
measurements with cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectra from Planck
Public Release (PR) 4, CMB lensing data from Planck PR4 and Atacama Cosmology
Telescope (ACT) DR6, uncalibrated Type Ia supernovae (SNe) data from the
Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 5 (DESY5) samples, and Weak Lensing
(WL) data from DES Year 1. Our major finding is that with CMB+BAO+WL and
CMB+BAO+SNe+WL, we find 3$\sigma$+ evidence for $A_{\rm lens} >1$, indicating a
higher than expected CMB lensing amplitude relative to the NPDDE prediction of
unity. This implies that for cosmology to accommodate realistic
quintessence-like dark energy models (as opposed to unrealistic phantom DE),
one would also need to explain a relatively significant presence of the lensing
anomaly.

Motivation: 重新审视CMB对宇宙空间曲率的约束，评估当曲率参数和原始暴胀标量谱在理论一致框架下处理时，约束如何变化。

Method: 基于闭合二次暴胀模型进行案例研究，其中原始谱以完全通用和规范不变的方式推导，分析Planck CMB似然函数。

Abstract: We revisit the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) constraints on the spatial
curvature of the Universe, assessing how they change when the curvature
parameter and the primordial inflationary scalar spectrum are treated
consistently within theoretically motivated frameworks. Instead of relying on
the phenomenological parametrisation commonly used to capture curvature effects
at the largest scales, we present a case study based on closed quadratic
inflation, where the primordial spectrum is derived in full generality and in a
gauge-invariant manner. Within this framework, we analyze both the
$\texttt{plik}$ PR3 and $\texttt{CamSpec}$ PR4 Planck CMB likelihoods and find
that the constraints on $\Omega_{\mathcal{K}}$ shift towards spatial flatness.
In $\texttt{plik}$ the preference for $\Omega_{\mathcal{K}}<0$ decreases from
$\gtrsim 3.5\sigma$ to $\sim 2.5\sigma$, while in $\texttt{CamSpec}$ it reduces
to $\sim 2\sigma$. At large angular scales ($\ell < 10$), our model explains
the low-$\ell$ power suppression anomaly, notably improving the fit to the
quadrupole. However, the reduced preference for highly negative values of
$\Omega_{\mathcal{K}}$ only partially accounts for the lensing anomaly at high
multipoles, worsening the fit to the $\texttt{plik}$ spectrum at small scales.
By contrast, in the $\texttt{CamSpec}$ PR4 spectrum, where the lensing anomaly
is less pronounced, the model yields an overall improvement. Our analysis
highlights a key conceptual point: closed-inflation models tie the curvature
parameter to the inflationary dynamics and the primordial spectrum, enforcing
consistency conditions that do not necessarily allow for the large deviations
from flatness seen in phenomenological parametrisations. In the case of
quadratic inflation, these restrictions reduce the apparent evidence for
negative curvature reported by earlier analyses, while allowing for a mildly
closed geometry.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以在角秒尺度上准确测量弱引力透镜效应，而时间延迟宇宙学需要更精确的视线方向效应建模。

Method: 使用高分辨率N体模拟和多平面光线追踪技术，将传统用于角分尺度的弱透镜计算方法扩展到角秒尺度的强透镜区域。

Result: 发现大尺度结构在约2角分区域内作为外部扰动源，产生不均匀波动；这些波动无法仅用外部剪切完全描述，需要包含外部弯曲；即使包含弯曲，时间延迟距离仍存在6.2‰偏差和2.5%不确定性。

Conclusion: 单平面近似存在局限性，时间延迟误差会沿视线方向累积，需要更精确的多平面建模方法。

Abstract: Time-delay cosmography, by monitoring the multiply imaged gravitational
lenses in the time domain, offers a promising and independent method for
measuring cosmological distances. However, in addition to the main deflector
that produces the multiple images, the large-scale structure along the
line-of-sight (LoS) will also deflect the traveling light rays, known as weak
lensing (WL). Due to resolution limitations, accurately measuring WL on
arcsecond scales is highly challenging. In this work, we evaluate the LoS
effects on both lensing images and time-delay measurements using a more
straightforward, high-resolution N-body simulation that provides a more
realistic matter distribution compared to the traditional, computationally
cheaper halo rendering method. We employ the multi-plane ray tracing technique,
which is traditionally utilized to compute WL effects at the arcminute scale,
extending its application to the strong lensing regime at the arcsecond scale.
We focus on the quadruple-image system and present the following findings: 1.
In addition to a constant external convergence, large-scale structures within a
region approximately 2 arcminutes in angular size act as external perturbers,
inducing inhomogeneous fluctuations on the arcsecond scale; 2. These
fluctuations cannot be fully accounted for by external shear alone,
necessitating the inclusion of external flexion; 3. While incorporating flexion
provides a reasonably good fit to the lensing image, the time-delay distance
still exhibits a $6.2$\textperthousand~bias and a $2.5\%$ uncertainty. This
underscores the limitations of the single-plane approximation, as time-delay
errors accumulate along the LoS.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了中波段选择的高红移星系聚类特性，发现其聚类性质与先前研究一致，可作为理解高红移宇宙的优良目标。


<details>

Motivation: 下一代大尺度结构光谱巡天将在高红移(2.3<z<3.5)探测宇宙学，需要有效选择高红移星系如莱曼α发射体和莱曼断裂星系。中波段测光技术是潜在的高效选择方法。

Method: 利用中波段成像巡天(IBIS)的光度数据和暗能量光谱仪(DESI)的光谱数据，对中波段选择的高红移星系进行聚类分析，采用晕占据分布(HOD)建模和大尺度结构扰动理论描述来解释聚类特性。

Abstract: Next-generation large-scale structure spectroscopic surveys will probe
cosmology at high redshifts $(2.3 < z < 3.5)$, relying on abundant galaxy
tracers such as Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) and Lyman break galaxies (LBGs).
Medium-band photometry has emerged as a potential technique for efficiently
selecting these high-redshift galaxies. In this work, we present clustering
analysis of medium-band selected galaxies at high redshift, utilizing
photometric data from the Intermediate Band Imaging Survey (IBIS) and
spectroscopic data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We
interpret the clustering of such samples using both Halo Occupation
Distribution (HOD) modeling and a perturbation theory description of
large-scale structure. Our modeling indicates that the current target sample is
composed from an overlapping mixture of LAEs and LBGs with emission lines.
Despite differences in target selection, we find that the clustering properties
are consistent with previous studies, with correlation lengths $r_0\simeq
3-4\,h^{-1}$Mpc and a linear bias of $b\sim1.8-2.5$. Finally, we discuss the
simulation requirements implied by these measurements and demonstrate that the
properties of the samples would make them excellent targets to enhance our
understanding of the high-$z$ universe.

Motivation: 验证DESI发现的暗能量演化偏好是否稳健，特别是考虑σ8张力和超新星数据校准问题的影响。

Method: 引入超参数Ω_m^growth分离弱引力透镜中的增长贡献，结合BAO、超新星和CMB数据，测试不同数据组合对暗能量演化偏好的影响。

Result: 结合BAO、CMB和弱引力透镜数据时，w0waCDM模型在约3σ水平受青睐；但加入超新星数据后，结果对数据选择敏感，排除低红移超新星数据会显著降低演化暗能量的证据。

Conclusion: 暗能量演化偏好的稳健性依赖于低红移超新星数据的改进，未来LSST的宇宙剪切测量将提供与当前超新星数据相当的能力来测试演化暗能量。

Abstract: Recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) have
shown a strong statistical preference for a time-evolving dark energy model
over $\Lambda$CDM when combining BAO, CMB, and supernova (SN) data. We
investigate the robustness of this conclusion by isolating geometric
information in weak lensing measurements from the DES Year 3 survey and
combining it with different datasets. We introduce a hyperparameter,
$\Omega_{\rm m}^{\rm growth}$, to decouple the growth contribution from the
lensing 2-point correlation and thus bypass the possible effect of the
$\sigma_8$ tension in our analysis. We then combine with the late-time
geometric probes provided by BAO and SN, along with CMB primary data. The
preference for evolving dark energy is consistent with the DESI-DR2 findings:
when combining BAO, primary CMB, and weak lensing data, the $w_0w_a$CDM is
preferred at about the $3\sigma$ significance. However, when we add SN, the
result is sensitive to the choice of data: if we leave out $z<0.1$ SN data in
the analysis, as a test of the effect of inhomogeneous calibration, we obtain a
statistical significance below $2\sigma$ for time evolving dark energy. Indeed,
the high-z only SN data \textbf{lowers} the evidence for evolving dark energy
in all the data combinations we have examined. This underscores the importance
of improved SN samples at low redshift and of alternative data combinations. We
show that cosmic shear measurements with LSST Year 1 data will provide
comparable power to current SN data. We discuss other low-redshift probes
provided by lensing and galaxy clustering to test for evolving dark energy.

Motivation: 研究宇宙中不同时期形成的天体，特别是星系形成时间的演化规律，以及哈勃常数张力对形成时间估计的影响

Method: 使用高斯过程和符号回归两种非参数重建方法，结合32个古老被动星系的年龄估计和Pantheon+超新星数据，考虑SH0ES和Planck两种H0值

Result: 在ΛCDM模型下，SH0ES H0值得到平均形成时间0.72^{+0.14}_{-0.16} Gyr，Planck H0值得到1.26^{+0.10}_{-0.11} Gyr；无模型约束时分别为0.71±0.19 Gyr和1.35^{+0.21}_{-0.23} Gyr

Conclusion: 星系具有不同的演化时间尺度，形成时间不是常数，在低红移(z≲0.5)有明显变化，不同方法结果一致，H0张力对形成时间估计有显著影响

Abstract: The Universe consists of a variety of objects that formed at different
epochs, leading to variations in the formation time which represents the time
elapsed from the onset of structure formation until the formation time of a
particular object. In this work, we present two approaches to reconstruct and
constrain the galaxy formation time $t_f(z)$ using non-parametric
reconstruction methods, such as Gaussian Processes (GP) and High-performance
Symbolic Regression (SR). Our analysis uses age estimates of 32 old passive
galaxies and the Pantheon+ type Ia supernova sample, and considers two
different values of the Hubble constant $H_0$ from the SH0ES and Planck
Collaborations. When adopting the $\Lambda$CDM model and the GP
reconstructions, we find $\left<t_f\right>=0.72_{-0.16}^{+0.14}$ Gyr (SH0ES)
and $\left<t_f\right>=1.26_{-0.11}^{+0.10}$ Gyr (Planck). Without considering a
specific cosmological model, we obtain $\left<t_f\right>=0.71 \pm {0.19}$ Gyr
(SH0ES) and $\left<t_f\right> = 1.35_{-0.23}^{+0.21}$ Gyr (Planck). Similar
values are obtained from the SR reconstructions, with both methods (GP and SR)
indicating the same behavior regarding the time evolution of $t_f(z)$. The
results also show significant differences in the formation time from SH0ES and
Planck values, highlighting the impact of the $H_0$ tension on the cosmological
estimates of $t_f(z)$. In particular, the different approaches used in the
analysis agree with each other, demonstrating the robustness and consistency of
our results. Overall, this study suggests that galaxies have different
evolutionary timescales and that $t_f$ is not constant, with noticeable
variations at lower redshifts ($z \lesssim 0.5$).

Motivation: 解决Swift观测中发现的AGN紫外/光学波段延迟时间比标准薄盘模型预测长3倍的"吸积盘尺寸问题"，探究其根本原因。

Method: 对Swift监测的AGN系统样本进行分析，通过相关性和回归分析研究X射线柱密度与延迟超额的关系，比较被遮蔽和未遮蔽AGN的延迟行为差异。

Result: 被遮蔽AGN显示显著升高的延迟超额（平均5.21±0.47），而未遮蔽AGN的延迟超额与标准盘预测一致（1.00±0.31）。X射线柱密度是延迟超额的最强预测因子，解释了80%以上的方差。

Conclusion: 吸积盘尺寸问题主要是由遮蔽物质产生的再处理辐射引起的，而非标准吸积盘理论的缺陷或宽线区污染。遮蔽可能通过再处理、散射和/或电离变化破坏高能和低能发射之间的连接。

Abstract: In the past decade, Swift has performed several AGN high-cadence
reverberation mapping campaigns, and generally found that the UV/optical
interband lags are $\sim$3 times longer than predicted for a standard thin
disk, thus coined "the accretion disk size problem". Here we present a
systematic sample of Swift-monitored AGN. In this analysis, we confirm the
accretion disk size problem, but find that the lag excess occurs only in the
subset of obscured AGN, which show a significantly elevated mean normalization
of $5.21 \pm 0.47$ ($p = 0.008$), whereas the unobscured AGN exhibit a mean
excess consistent with standard disk predictions ($1.00 \pm 0.31$). Correlation
and regression analyses similarly reveal X-ray column density as the strongest
predictor of lag excess, explaining over 80% of its variance. We interpret
these results as line-of-sight obscuration being linked to the too-long lags
via additional reprocessed emission from the absorbing material itself. The
consistency of lags in the unobscured subgroup with standard disk predictions
suggests that the accretion disk size problem is not the result of shortcomings
of standard accretion disk theory nor contamination by the broad-line region
(BLR). X-ray to UV lag amplitudes and correlations show more complex and
variable behavior in obscured AGN, suggesting that obscuration may disrupt or
complicate the connection between high- and low-energy emission potentially
through reprocessing, scattering, and/or ionization changes.

Result: UV与X射线光变在50天内同步上升，但硬X射线与UV相关性弱且时序关系异常（硬X射线略微领先UV）。

Conclusion: 观测结果支持UV和X射线各自独立随机波动的模型，仅通过光传播时间微弱连接，这对理解AGN结构和未来监测有重要意义。

Abstract: The accretion flow in AGN is not well understood, motivating intensive
monitoring campaigns of multiwavelength variability to probe its structure. One
of the best of these is the 3 year optical/UV/X-ray approximately daily
monitoring campaign on Fairall\,9, a fairly typical moderate accretion rate
AGN. The UV lightcurve shows a clear increase over $\sim 50$ days between years
1 and 2, strongly coherent with the X-ray lightcurve rise. This changes the
average spectral energy distribution such that the disc component is stronger
while the X-ray spectrum steepens, so that the total X-ray power remains
roughly constant. Outside of this global change, we apply a Fourier resolved
analysis to test stochastic models where intrinsic fluctuations in the UV disc
propagate down into the hard X-ray emission region via both changing the seed
photon flux for Compton scattering (short light travel timescale) and changing
the electron density (longer propagation timescale). Unlike these models, the
hard X-rays are not particularly well correlated with the UV, and also have the
wrong sign in that the hard X-rays marginally lead the UV fluctuations. We show
that this is instead consistent with uncorrelated stochastic fluctuations in
both the UV (slow) and X-ray (fast), which are linked together only weakly via
light travel time. These variability properties, as well as the changes in the
SED, has implications for our understanding of AGN structure and physics, as
well as future monitoring campaigns.

Method: 采用解析分析方法，研究激波速度v穿过质量为M_e、不透明度为κ、半径为R_e的扩展物质时产生的辐射，重点分析不同τ_e值下的辐射特征。

Result: 发现辐射性质随τ_e变化：当τ_e >> c/v时产生"边缘爆发"，包括UV主导的爆发脉冲和冷却辐射；当τ_e ≲ c/v时产生"风爆发"，爆发脉冲延长且辐射从UV向X射线转变。推导了不同辐射阶段的持续时间和光度对参数的依赖关系。

Abstract: Early light curves of many core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are thought to be
powered by the interaction of the shock wave with optically thick extended
material, either a bound envelope or preexplosion ejected circumstellar matter
(CSM). We analytically analyze the early emission produced by a shock with
velocity $v$ traversing a material of mass $M_\mathrm{e}$ and opacity $\kappa$
extending to radius $R_\mathrm{e}$, and show the emission varies qualitatively
with varying $\tau_\mathrm{e}=\kappa\!M_\mathrm{e}/(4\pi\!R_\mathrm{e}^2)$: For
$\tau_\mathrm{e}\gg\!c/v$ a shock breakout occurs near $R_\mathrm{e}$ producing
an ``edge breakout"- a UV-dominated breakout burst followed by ``cooling
emission" of the shock-heated material; for $\tau_\mathrm{e}\lesssim\!c/v$ a
``wind breakout" occurs- the breakout pulse is prolonged and followed by
extended emission shifting from UV to X-ray as the shock becomes collisionless.
We derive the dependence on $\{v,\kappa,M_\mathrm{e},R_\mathrm{e}\}$ of the
duration and luminosity characterizing the different emission phases, and show
that current observations typically do not allow inference of all parameters.
In particular, since the optical bands lie in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of
radiation emitted during the cooling phase, the observed cooling luminosity
depends weakly on radius, $\propto\!R_\mathrm{e}^{1/4}$, leading to $1-2$
orders of magnitude uncertainty in its inferred value. This suggests, e.g.,
that the common day-scale light curve features in Stripped-Envelope SNe do not
necessarily imply material extending to $R_\mathrm{e}\sim10^3\!R_\odot$ and are
often consistent with low-mass $R_\mathrm{e}\sim\!10^2\!R_\odot$ bound
envelopes. Early multiband coverage (especially in UV/X-ray) can break these
degeneracies; the forthcoming \emph{ULTRASAT} UV mission will allow inferring
the properties of extended material around the population of SNe progenitors.

Abstract: The distribution of binary black hole (BBH) masses and its evolution with
redshift provide key insights into the different formation channels of the
compact objects and their evolution with cosmic time and stellar properties
such stellar metallicity and star formation rate history. We present a non
parametric, model-independent joint reconstruction of the redshift evolution of
BBH mass distribution from gravitational wave (GW) catalog GWTC-4.0 from the
fourth observation of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK). This method simultaneously
searches for the signature of any linear and quadratic redshift evolution with
respect to the low redshift in a Bayesian framework taking into accounting the
detector selection effects. We find tentative evidence for a linear
redshift-dependent evolution of the mass distribution, consistent over a mass
range ($m \gtrsim 50\,M_\odot$). While lower mass systems shows no signature of
evolution. The quadratic term remains consistent with zero, indicating that a
simple linear dependence adequately describes the population up to redshift $z
\sim 1$. In future with more GW sources, this technique can shed light into the
true nature of the redshift dependence and possibility to uncover subtle
evolutionary features in BBH populations and to probe the cosmic history of
black hole formation.

Abstract: The recent announcement of the detection of the ultra-high-energy (UHE)
neutrino event KM3-230213A by the KM3NeT telescope represents a critical
opportunity to explore the origins of cosmic neutrinos and their potential
gamma-ray counterparts. With an inferred neutrino energy exceeding 100 PeV,
this event stands as the most energetic neutrino observed to date. The large
offset from the galactic plane (11 degrees) and the presence of several blazars
with temporally correlated multiwavelength counterparts within the 3 degrees
localization region raise the possibility of an extragalactic origin.
Additionally, the event's apparent tension with IceCube constraints suggests
that it could be transient in nature rather than cosmogenic. VERITAS conducted
a targeted follow-up campaign to search for very-high-energy (VHE, greater than
100 GeV) gamma-ray emission associated with KM3-230213A. Observations were
performed in February and March 2025, using a four-point wobble strategy
centered on the best-fit neutrino position, covering nearly the entire 90
percent confidence region. These observations probe potential hadronic
gamma-ray emission from a common origin with the neutrino, placing constraints
on particle-acceleration scenarios. We present the results of this search,
including upper limits on very-high-energy gamma-ray flux and their
implications for possible source models of KM3-230213A.

Abstract: Calcium-rich gap transients are a faint, fast-evolving class of supernovae
that show strong nebular Ca emission lines. Their progenitor systems are
uncertain, but they are often associated with old and quiescent host galaxies.
In this work, we compare the properties of the hosts of hydrogen-poor Ca-rich
gap transients to the hosts of 3 other classes of supernova (SNe): normal Type
Ia, 91bg-like, and Type II. We use data from the Zwicky Transient Facility
(ZTF) Census of the Local Universe (CLU) experiment to build up our 4 SNe
samples and identify the host galaxies. A combination of precomputed host
properties from the CLU catalog and those derived from SED fitting are used to
characterize each host's stellar mass, star formation rate, and specific star
formation rate (sSFR). We find that the hosts of Ca-rich gap transients and
91bg-like SNe occupy a similar parameter space of mass and sSFR, and are more
massive and quiescent compared to the hosts of Type Ia and Type II SNe.
Additionally, we construct delay time distributions (DTDs) for our 4 samples,
finding that Ca-rich gap transients and 91bg-like SNe have the longest peak
delay times $\sim 10^4$ Myr, compared to the peak delay times of Type Ia SNe
($\sim 10^3$ Myr) and Type II SNe ($\sim 10$ Myr). The similarity of host
environment and DTDs for Ca-rich gap transients and 91bg-like SNe motivates

TL;DR: 对银河系最年轻超新星遗迹G1.9+0.3的空间分辨光谱分析显示，射电亮缘和X射线亮缘的同步辐射截止能量约为1keV，表明射电亮缘的磁场比X射线亮缘更湍流，这归因于射电亮缘与CO云团的相互作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究G1.9+0.3超新星遗迹中不同区域磁场湍流程度的差异，以理解射电亮缘强射电辐射的成因。

Method: 采用空间分辨光谱分析，通过同步辐射模型拟合X射线光谱，计算截止能量和Bohm因子。

Result: 射电亮缘的Bohm因子为2-4，X射线亮缘为12-15，表明射电亮缘磁场更湍流；射电亮缘与CO云团相互作用导致激波减速和湍流增强。

Conclusion: 射电亮缘的强射电辐射主要源于与CO云团相互作用产生的放大磁场，而西南方向的CO云团位于前景，未产生显著影响。

Abstract: We present on results of a spatially resolved spectral analysis of G1.9+0.3,
the youngest known supernova remnant in the Galaxy. The X-ray spectra are well
described by synchrotron emission from a power-law electron distribution with
an exponential cutoff. We found a cutoff energy $\epsilon_0 \sim 1 ~ \rm{keV}$
in both the radio bright rim and the X-ray bright rims. In the loss-limited
case, the cutoff energy depends on the shock velocity $v_{\rm{sh}}$ and the
Bohm factor $\eta$, following the relation $\epsilon_0 \propto v_{\rm{sh}}^2
\eta^{-1} $. Our analysis shows that $\eta$ ranges from 2 to 4 in the radio rim
and from 12 to 15 in the X-ray rims. This suggests that the magnetic field in
the radio rim is more turbulent than in the X-ray rims. The presence of CO
clouds along the radio rim likely contributes to this difference. Interaction
between the shock and these clouds can slow the shock down and generate
turbulent eddies. The resulting turbulence eddies can amplify the magnetic
field. We propose that the strong radio emission from the radio rim is
primarily due to this amplified magnetic field. In contrast, a CO cloud located
in the south-west appears to lie in the foreground, as indicated by its low
turbulence and the absence of shock deceleration.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了中子衰变成暗粒子的可能性对中子星合并中输运过程的影响，发现暗衰变率在介质中较慢，最多使Urca体黏度降低2-3倍，但如果衰变更快，则可能在合并环境中显著增强体黏度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决中子寿命测量差异的问题，探索中子衰变成暗粒子对中子星合并物理的影响。

Method: 考虑暗扇区由暗重子χ和暗标量φ组成，中子通过n→χ+φ通道衰变，分析这种额外衰变通道对中子星合并中输运过程的影响。

Result: 在介质中中子暗衰变率较慢，暗重子最多使致密物质状态方程降低Urca体黏度2-3倍；如果衰变更快，在数十MeV的合并温度下体黏度会显著增强。

Conclusion: 中子暗衰变可能通过改变体黏度影响中子星合并动力学，快速衰变可增强体黏度并阻尼合并环境中的振荡，为缓慢平衡物质提供特征信号。

Abstract: The possibility of neutron decay into dark particles has been proposed as a
way to resolve a growing discrepancy between two different measurements of the
neutron lifetime. The most popular formulation is a dark sector consisting of a
dark baryon $\chi$ and a dark scalar $\phi$, where a neutron in vacuum decays
about 1% of the time via the channel $n\rightarrow \chi+\phi$. In this work, we
consider the effect of this additional neutron decay channel on transport in
neutrons star mergers. We find that the neutron dark decay rate in medium is
quite slow, and thus the dark baryons modify the dense matter equation of state
in a way that decreases the Urca bulk viscosity by, at most, a factor of 2-3.
However, if the neutron dark decay was to occur more rapidly, then the bulk
viscosity at merger temperatures of tens of MeV would be strongly enhanced,
potentially rapidly damping oscillations in merger environments and therefore
providing a signature of slowly equilibrating matter in the merger.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寻找白矮星被中等质量黑洞潮汐瓦解的直接观测证据，这类事件理论上应产生比普通恒星TDE更强大、更短暂的耀斑，但此前一直缺乏观测支持

Method: 通过观测快速X射线瞬变源EP250702a，分析其光变曲线、能谱特征和演化过程，包括一天内的峰值亮度、反复耀斑、伽马射线延伸至数十MeV、喷流X射线在20天内急剧下降等特征

Result: 观测到与任何已知瞬变现象不符的特征：强相对论性喷流、快速演化时间尺度、极超爱丁顿光度软分量，这些特征唯一符合白矮星被中等质量黑洞潮汐瓦解的理论预测

Conclusion: EP250702a是首个观测到的白矮星潮汐瓦解事件，为研究中质量黑洞和致密星内部结构开辟了新途径

Abstract: Stars captured by black holes (BHs) can be tore apart by strong tidal force,
producing electromagnetic flares. Some 100 tidal disruption events (TDEs) have
been observed, involving invariably normal gaseous stars whose debris falls
onto the BH fueling the flares over years. White dwarfs (WDs)-the most
prevalent compact stars a million times denser and thus tougher than gaseous
stars-can only be disrupted by intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) of
10^2-10^5 solar masses. WD-TDEs are predicted to generate more powerful and
short-lived flares, but their evidence has been lacking. Here we report
observations of a fast, luminous X-ray transient EP250702a. Its one-day-long
peak showed strong recurrent flares extending to several tens of MeV in
gamma-rays, indicating relativistic jet emission. The jet X-rays dropped
sharply from exceeding 3 x 10^49 to around 10^44 erg/s within 20 days. These
characteristics are inconsistent with any known transient phenomena other than
a jetted-TDE evolving within a short timespan previously unseen-indicating the
disruption of a white dwarf by an IMBH. At late times, a new soft component
progressively dominates the X-ray spectrum, exhibiting extreme super-Eddington
luminosity, possibly from an accretion disc. WD-TDEs open a new window to study
elusive IMBHs and the otherwise invisible interior of degenerate stars.

Motivation: 区分银河系γ射线源的强子性和轻子性起源一直具有挑战性，非热X射线谱测量被认为是有效的区分方法，但需要更深入地了解次级电子/正电子产生的X射线发射形态特征。

Method: 通过计算次级电子/正电子产生的X射线表面亮度分布和光子指数分布，分析其形态特征。

Result: 研究发现次级电子产生的X射线表面亮度分布具有独特的平坦特征，这种形态特征与轻子性起源明显不同。

Conclusion: 除了X射线光谱外，X射线形态学对于确定超高能γ射线源的辐射机制至关重要，有助于识别PeV宇宙射线源。

Abstract: Galactic $\gamma$-ray sources can be produced by either high-energy protons
via proton-proton collisions or electrons/positrons via inverse Compton
scattering. Distinguishing between the hadronic and leptonic origin of
$\gamma$-ray emission in Galactic sources remains challenging. Measurements of
non-thermal X-ray spectra of these sources, which could originate from primary
electrons in the leptonic scenario or secondary electrons/positrons in the
hadronic scenario, have been suggested as an efficient way of discriminating
between these scenarios. In this work, we investigate the morphology of the
X-ray emission from secondary electrons/positrons. By calculating the surface
brightness profile and the photon index profile of X-ray emission, we find that
secondary electrons produce a distinctively flat X-ray surface brightness
profile. Our results suggest that, in addition to the X-ray spectrum, the X-ray
morphology is crucial to determine the radiation mechanism of ultrahigh-energy
$\gamma$-ray sources and help to identify sources of PeV cosmic rays.

Conclusion: 耗散和随机力显著影响粒子在磁偶极场中的运动特性，并导致电磁辐射频谱中出现特征峰值。

Abstract: We consider a generalization of the classical nonrelativistic St\"{o}rmer
problem, describing the motion of charged particles in a purely magnetic dipole
field, by taking into account the effects of the dissipation, assumed to be of
friction type, proportional to the velocity of the particle, and of the
presence of stochastic forces. In the presence of dissipative/stochastic
effects, the motion of the particle in the magnetic dipole field can be
described by a generalized Langevin type equation, which generalizes the
standard Lorentz force equation. We perform a detailed numerical analysis of
the dynamical behavior of the particles in a magnetic dipolar field in the
presence of dissipative and stochastic forces, as well as of the
electromagnetic radiation patterns emitted during the motion. The effects of
the dissipation coefficient and of the stochastic force on the particle motion
and on the emitted electromagnetic power are investigated, and thus a full
description of the spectrum of the magnetic dipole type electromagnetic
radiation and of the physical properties of the motion is also obtained. The
power spectral density of the emitted electromagnetic power is also obtained
for each case, and, for all considered St\"{o}rmer type models, it shows the
presence of peaks in the radiation spectrum, corresponding to certain intervals
of the frequency.

Abstract: The search for gamma-ray counterparts to gravitational-wave events with the
CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) requires accurate and robust background
modeling. Previous CALET observing runs (O3 and O4) relied on averaged
pre/post-event baselines or low-order polynomial fits, approaches that neglect
correlated noise, temporal non-stationarity, and the propagation of background
uncertainty into derived flux upper limits. These simplifications can lead to
reduced sensitivity to faint or atypical transients. In this work, we present a
novel Bayesian framework for background estimation based on Gaussian Process
(GP) regression and change-point modeling. Our approach captures correlated
structures in the detector background, quantifies predictive uncertainties, and
propagates them into both detection statistics and Bayesian credible upper
limits. We demonstrate, using archival CALET time-tagged event data and
simulated signal injections, that our method improves sensitivity to weak
short-duration bursts by up to an order of magnitude compared to traditional
polynomial fits. This probabilistic background treatment enables a more
physically robust interpretation of non-detections and offers a scalable,
real-time compatible extension for future joint multi-messenger searches. All

Motivation: 电子俘获超新星被认为是产生中子星的重要机制，特别是形成X射线双星和双中子星系统的替代通道，但其起源仍存在不确定性，需要系统梳理相关研究进展。

Method: 采用综述研究方法，系统回顾了EC-SNe的两种前身星通道：单星通道(超渐近巨星支星或He星)和双星通道(双星中的He星或白矮星双星中的吸积诱导坍缩)。

Result: 总结了EC-SNe的初始参数范围、演化路径、相关天体及观测约束，特别讨论了通过NS+He星双星形成双中子星的过程，其中He星伴星经历EC-SN。

Conclusion: EC-SNe研究处于关键阶段，存在重要的理论不确定性和观测挑战，需要综合建模和多波段观测来进行可靠识别。

Abstract: It is generally believed that the electron-capture reactions happen when the
oxygen-neon (ONe) cores grow in masses close to the Chandrasekhar limit,
leading to the formation of neutron stars (NSs) via electron-capture supernovae
(EC-SNe). EC-SNe are predicted to be the most likely short-lived and faint
optical transients, and a small ejecta mass is expected during the collapse.
This kind of SNe provide an alternative channel for producing isolated NSs and
NS systems, especially for the formation of X-ray binaries and double NSs.
However, there are still some uncertainties for the origin of EC-SNe. In this
article, we review recent studies on the two classic progenitor channels of
EC-SNe, i.e., the single star channel and the binary star channel. In the
single star channel, EC-SNe can happen in super asymptotic giant branch stars
or He stars, whereas in the binary star channel EC-SNe can occur in He stars in
binaries (including He star+MS systems and NS+He star systems) or
accretion-induced collapse in white dwarf binaries (including the
single-degenerate scenario and the double-degenerate scenario). Recent progress
on the two progenitor channels is discussed, including the initial parameter
range for EC-SNe, the evolutionary paths to EC-SNe, related objects, and some
observational constraints, etc. We also discuss the formation of double NSs
through NS+He star binaries, in which the He star companion experiences an
EC-SN. Research on EC-SNe is at a pivotal stage, with key theoretical
uncertainties and observational challenges requiring integrated modeling and
multi-wavelength observations for robust identification.

### [30] [Time-Dependent obscuration of a tidal disruption event candidate in the active galactic nucleus CSS100217](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25935)
*Ying Gu,Xiao Li,Xing-Qian Cheng,Dou-Dou Wang,Xue-Guang Zhang,En-Wei Liang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: CSS100217是一个特殊的潮汐瓦解事件候选体，发生在活动星系核中。与典型TDE不同，其爆发后亮度比爆发前暗约0.4星等。研究提出被遮蔽的TDE模型来解释其光变曲线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CSS100217表现出不寻常的光变特性，爆发后亮度比爆发前更暗，这与典型TDE行为不同，需要新的理论解释。

Method: 假设时间依赖的遮蔽效应（由TDE未束缚恒星碎片或核区云团运动引起）服从Weibull分布，建立被遮蔽TDE模型来拟合光变曲线。

Result: 模型成功描述了CSS100217的光变曲线，表明这是4.6倍太阳质量的主序星被3.3×10^7倍太阳质量黑洞潮汐瓦解的事件，总能量7.23×10^53尔格，约1.38倍太阳质量的碎片被吸积。

Conclusion: 遮蔽效应可能在解释CSS100217中观测到的不寻常TDE类变异性方面起重要作用，宿主星系对观测到的爆发前光学亮度的贡献不显著。

Abstract: CSS100217 is considered a peculiar tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate
occurring in an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Unlike typical TDEs, where the
post-flare luminosity is equal to that pre-flare, CSS100217 decayed to $\sim$
0.4 magnitudes fainter than its pre-flare V band level. In this manuscript, we
propose an obscured TDE model to explain the light curve of CSS100217. Assuming
that the time-dependent obscuration, caused by the TDE unbound stellar debris,
or by nuclear clouds moving around the supermassive black hole (SMBH), follows
a Weibull distribution, we find that the light curve of CSS100217 can be
described by the tidal disruption of a $4.6_{-0.9}^{+0.9}{\rm M_\odot}$
main-sequence star by a $3.3_{-0.3}^{+0.3}\times10^7{\rm M_\odot}$ black hole.
The total energy of the event derived from our fit is $7.23\times10^{53}$ ergs
and about 1.38 ${\rm M_\odot}$ of debris mass is accreted by the central SMBH.
The model indicates that the contribution of the host galaxy to the observed
pre-flare optical luminosity is not-significant compared to that of the AGN,
which is consistent with the results of the spectral analysis. These results
suggest that obscuration may play an important role in explaining the unusual
TDE-like variability observed in CSS100217.

Result: 确认了GPM J1723-33的脉冲信号，发现所有4个候选体都有短轨道周期（<24小时），表现出频率依赖性食现象，其中3个与DECaPS光学源空间一致。

Conclusion: 这些发现为理解银河系中心γ射线过剩提供了新的线索，但需要大型望远镜的后续观测来确认真正的光学对应体。

Abstract: This paper reports the discovery and follow-up of four candidate redback
spider pulsars: GPM J1723-33, GPM J1734-28, GPM J1752-30 and GPM J1815-14,
discovered with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) from an imaging survey of
the Galactic Plane. These sources are considered to be redback candidates based
on their eclipsing variability, steep negative spectral indices, and potential
Fermi $\gamma$-ray associations, with GPM J1723-33 and GPM J1815-14 lying
within a Fermi 95% error ellipse. Follow-up pulsation searches with MeerKAT
confirmed pulsations from GPM J1723-33, while the non-detections of the other
three are likely due to scattering by material ablated from their companion
stars. We identify possible orbital periods by applying folding algorithms to
the light curves and determine that all sources have short orbital periods (<24
hours), consistent with redback spider systems. Following up on the sources at
multiple radio frequencies revealed that the sources exhibit
frequency-dependent eclipses, with longer eclipses observed at lower
frequencies. We place broad constraints on the eclipse medium, ruling out
induced Compton scattering and cyclotron absorption. Three sources are
spatially consistent with optical sources in the Dark Energy Camera Plane
Survey imaging, which may contain the optical counterparts. Each field is
affected by strong dust extinction, and follow-up with large telescopes is
needed to identify the true counterparts. Identifying potential radio
counterparts to four previously unassociated Fermi sources brings us closer to
understanding the origin of the unexplained $\gamma$-ray excess in the Galactic
Centre.

Abstract: We report on the search for ultra-high-energy neutrinos from the prompt
emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) using Surface Detector (SD) data from Phase
I of the Pierre Auger Observatory (2004-2021). A total of 570 GRBs occur within
the most neutrino-sensitive field of view of the SD, considering both
Earth-skimming and downward-going detection channels. For this purpose, GRB
neutrino emission has been modeled using the numerical software NeuCosmA,
incorporating gamma-ray measurements and inferred parameters such as the jet
Lorentz factor and the minimum variability time scale. No neutrino candidates
were found, and upper limits were obtained by stacking the individual GRB
neutrino fluences. These limits are complementary to those of IceCube and
ANTARES and provide the strongest constraints on prompt GRB neutrino fluence
above $10^{18}$ eV. Additionally, limits on GRB fluence in alternative models
of neutrino production have been derived using Auger data.

Motivation: 研究CTA~1的甚高能发射特性，特别是为了解释LHAASO和VERITAS观测到的能谱分布差异，这些差异可能源于复杂的能量依赖形态和不同实验的角分辨率差异。

Method: 使用SST-1M望远镜（一对小型成像大气切伦科夫望远镜）在单镜和立体模式下进行观测，积累了约30小时的选定观测数据。这些望远镜对1-300 TeV能量范围的伽马射线敏感。

Conclusion: CTA~1的复杂结构和不同伽马射线探测器观测结果的差异需要通过更高精度的观测来理解，SST-1M望远镜的观测数据将有助于揭示这些差异的原因并更好地表征源的高能发射特性。

Abstract: CTA~1 is a composite supernova remnant featuring a shell structure and an
inner Pulsar Wind Nebula. The shell is visible in the radio band, while Fermi
has detected the radio-quiet pulsar PSR J0007+7303 at its core. Gamma-ray
detectors such as LHAASO and VERITAS have detected TeV emission in the vicinity
of the pulsar. However, the derived SEDs from LHAASO WCDA and VERITAS show
significant discrepancies, which could be due to a complicated energy-dependent
morphology not accounted for in the spectral analysis, and different angular
resolution of the two experiments. CTA~1 has been a target for dedicated
observations by the SST-1M telescopes, a pair of small-sized Imaging
Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) capable of operating in both mono and
stereo modes. Located at the Ond\v{r}ejov Observatory in Czech Republic, these
telescopes are sensitive to the high energy range of the gamma-ray spectrum,
spanning from 1 to 300 TeV. To investigate the very high-energy emission of
CTA~1, the SST-1Ms have accumulated approximately 30 hours of selected
observations, aiming to further constrain the characteristics of the source's
high energy emission, and to shed some light into the discrepancy between
different experiments.

Result: 模型成功再现了观测到的偏振度及其随能量增加的趋势，但未能捕捉偏振角演化，表明可能存在非轴对称性。

Conclusion: 观测结果支持高倾角ADC几何，但偏振角变化暗示系统可能存在内盘/中子星自旋与外盘/风的错位或弱盘翘曲等非轴对称特征。

Abstract: We report an X-ray polarization degree (PD) of $8.8\pm1.4\%~(1\sigma)$ from
the accretion-disc-corona (ADC) neutron-star system 2S 0921-630 (=V395 Car)
observed with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). The PD increases
with energy, while the polarization angle (PA) varies significantly across the
band. These trends are consistent with a high-inclination ADC geometry where
the vertically extended disc blocks direct sight of the central X-ray source,
and the observed X-rays are those scattered in an equatorial disc wind. We also
find tentative PD variability in the 2--3 keV band. To interpret the
time-averaged polarization, we build spectropolarimetric models by Monte Carlo
radiation transfer simulation with column density distribution of
thermal-radiative wind launched by X-ray irradiation of the outer disc under an
axisymmetric geometry. The model combines boundary-layer emission, its disc
reflection, and the disc continuum, each with its intrinsic polarization.
Scattering of this composite spectrum in the wind reproduces both the observed
PD and its increase with energy. However, the observed PA evolution is not
captured, which may indicate departures from axisymmetry--e.g. misalignment
between the inner disc (and/or neutron-star spin) and the outer disc/wind, or a
weak disc warping.

Motivation: 最近对GW200105事件的重分析声称观测到偏心轨道特征，但文献指出某些物理效应或修改引力理论可能产生虚假的偏心信号。需要一种模型无关的方法来区分真实偏心与模拟效应。

Method: 使用新开发的偏心演化一致性检验(EECT)，通过比较测量的偏心频率演化e(f)与广义相对论预期值来识别模拟效应。

Result: GW200105事件在68%置信度内满足EECT检验，其偏心频率演化与广义相对论预测一致。

Conclusion: 分析结果为GW200105的偏心轨道假设提供了补充支持，同时为偏心频率演化与广义相对论的一致性提供了新颖检验。

Abstract: GW200105 is a compact binary coalescence (CBC) event, consisting of a neutron
star and a black hole, observed in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's (LVK's) third observing
run (O3). Recent reanalyses of the event using state-of-the-art waveform models
have claimed observation of signatures of an eccentric orbit. It has
nevertheless been pointed out in the literature that certain physical or
modified gravity effects could mimic eccentricity by producing a spurious
non-zero eccentricity value, at a given reference frequency, when recovered
with an eccentric waveform model. We recently developed a model-independent
Eccentricity Evolution Consistency Test (EECT, S. A. Bhat et al. 2025) to
identify such mimickers, by comparing the measured frequency
$\textit{evolution}$ of eccentricity, $e(f)$, with that expected from General
Relativity (GR). In this $\textit{Letter}$, we apply EECT to GW200105 and find
that it satisfies EECT within 68% confidence. Our analysis therefore lends
complementary support in favour of the eccentricity hypothesis, while also
providing a novel test of the consistency of $e(f)$ with GR.

TL;DR: GRB 250702B/EP250702a是一个有趣的长时标伽马射线瞬变源，通过多卫星联合观测发现其包含前兆、主暴和后续软X射线辐射，支持非典型塌缩星超长伽马暴而非潮汐瓦解事件的解释。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GRB 250702B/EP250702a的性质争议，通过多波段联合观测来理解这个长时标伽马射线瞬变源的本质。

Method: 在ETJASMIN框架下，联合Insight-HXMT、GECAM和Fermi/GBM数据，在30天宽时间窗口内进行全面的目标搜索。

Result: 发现50秒前兆（主暴前25小时）、4小时主暴（包含4个发射阶段），以及后续软X射线以-5/3幂律衰减，与回落吸积标准预测完美一致。

Conclusion: 前兆、主暴和后续软X射线特征强烈支持非典型塌缩星超长伽马暴情景，而非潮汐瓦解事件，所有辐射可能源自超巨星死亡塌缩期间回落吸积主导的相对论性喷流。

Abstract: GRB 250702B/EP250702a is an interesting long-duration gamma-ray transient
whose nature is in debate. To obtain a full picture in gamma-ray band, we
implement a comprehensive targeted search of burst emission in a wide window of
30 days jointly with Insight-HXMT, GECAM and Fermi/GBM data within the ETJASMIN
framework. In gamma-ray band, we find there is a 50-second precursor about 25
hours before the 4-hour main burst, which generally consists of 4 emission
episodes. Remarkably, we find that the soft X-ray emission (after the main
burst) decays as a power-law with start time aligning with the last episode of
main emission and index of -5/3 perfectly consistent with the canonical
prediction of fallback accretion. We conclude that the properties of precursor,
main burst and the following soft X-ray emission strongly support the atypical
collapsar Ultra-Long Gamma-Ray Burst (ULGRB) scenario rather than the Tidal
Disruption Event (TDE), and all these gamma-ray and soft X-ray emission
probably originate from relativistic jet whose luminosity is dominated by the
fallback accretion rate during the death collapse of a supergiant star.

Abstract: The enigma of cosmic ray origin and propagation stands as a key question in
particle astrophysics. The precise spatial and spectral measurements of diffuse
Galactic gamma-ray emission provide new avenues for unraveling this mystery.
Based on 16 years of Fermi-LAT observations, we find that the diffuse gamma-ray
spectral shapes are nearly identical for low energies (below a few GeV) but
show significant dispersion at high energies (above a few GeV) across the
Galactic disk. We further show that the diffuse emission can be decomposed into
two components, a universal spectral component dominating at low energies which
is consistent with the expectation from interactions of background cosmic rays
and the interstellar matter, and a spatially variant component dominating at
high energies which is likely due to local accelerators. These findings suggest
that there is dual-origin of the Galactic diffuse emission, including the
``cosmic ray sea'' from efficient propagation of particles and the ``cosmic ray
islands'' from inefficient propagation of particles, and thus shed new light on
the understanding of the propagation models of Galactic cosmic rays.

Conclusion: 致密中微子系统中的快速味转换与等离子体和自引力系统中的非线性现象存在深刻类比，这些类比有助于理解中微子振荡的未解之谜，并揭示了新的物理现象。

Abstract: Dense neutrino systems, which display collectivity mediated by the weak
interaction, have deep parallels with mean-field kinetic systems governed by
other fundamental forces. We identify analogues in fast flavor conversion (FFC)
of some time-honored nonlinear phenomena in plasmas and self-gravitating
systems. We focus in particular on nonlinear Landau damping and collisionless
equilibria, which are likely important pieces of the unsolved puzzle of
neutrino oscillations in core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. Our
analysis additionally reveals the previously unexplored phenomenon of
flavor-wave synchronization.

TL;DR: Swift J174610.4-290018是一个特殊的X射线瞬变源，通过多卫星观测数据分析，发现其光谱特征与共生双星/再发新星情景更一致，而非先前提出的低质量X射线双星模型。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Swift J174610.4-290018的光谱和时间特性，以确定其真实的天体物理性质，特别是检验先前提出的低质量X射线双星模型是否合理。

Method: 综合分析Swift、NuSTAR和Chandra卫星在2000年10月至2024年7月期间的X射线观测数据，包括光谱分析和时序特性研究。

Result: 发现该源在2005年可能有一次爆发，随后进入约19年的宁静期；X射线光谱显示高温热等离子体特征和显著的中性及高度电离铁发射线；共生双星/再发新星模型比低质量X射线双星模型更能解释观测特性。

Conclusion: Swift J174610.4-290018更可能是共生双星/再发新星系统，如果确认，将是银河系中心发现的首个新星，为研究大质量白矮星和Sgr A*附近的宽双星系统提供新见解。

Abstract: Swift J174610.4-290018, a peculiar transient X-ray source originally
discovered by the Swift satellite in February 2024 at the onset of its
outburst, recently attracted intentional or coincident follow-up X-ray
observations using Swift, NuSTAR and Chandra. We have performed a comprehensive
analysis of the relevant X-ray data to investigate the spectral and temporal
properties of this source between October 2000 and July 2024. Archival Chandra
data reveal a plausible additional outburst in 2005, followed by a quiescent
state in the next $\sim$19 years. The X-ray spectra in both the quiescent and
outburst phases are consistent with a thermal plasma spectrum with relatively
high temperatures ($\sim$10 keV) and prominent emission lines from both neutral
and highly-ionized iron. A previously proposed low-mass X-ray binary/accretion
disk corona scenario for Swift J174610, based on XRISM observations near the
peak of the 2024 outburst, is examined against the newly derived X-ray
properties and is disfavored, in particular due to its difficulty in explaining
the quiescent state spectrum. Instead, we suggest a symbiotic binary/recurrent
nova scenario, which gains support from many of the observed X-ray properties
of Swift J174610 and a close comparison with the famous Galactic recurrent nova
RS Oph. If confirmed, Swift J174610 would represent the first nova detected in
the Galactic center, offering new insights into the otherwise elusive
population of massive white dwarfs as well as wide binaries in the close
vicinity of Sgr A*. Our findings call for multi-wavelength follow-up
observations for this highly unusual X-ray source.

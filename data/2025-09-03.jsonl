We\nfocus on the evolution of these stars until core-collapse, in addition to their\nrotation, which could influence their mass loss and explosion phenomenology. We\nfind that (i) as in previous studies, larger mass gain by merger favors the\nproduction of blue supergiants (BSGs) over red supergiants, and (ii) merger\nproducts that end as BSGs at core collapse have rotating outer envelopes, with\nlower-mass BSGs having faster envelope rotation due to less wind mass loss. We\nmodel the expected transients from these BSGs upon core-collapse, considering\ncases where the neutrino-driven explosion is successful and unsuccessful. The\nsuccessful explosions result in supernovae (SNe) with long-rising light curves\nof morphology similar to SN 1987A. Failed explosions of these BSGs result in\nenvelope fallback of $\\sim (0.1$- several) $~M_\\odot$ over $10^3$-$10^5$\nseconds that power strong ($10^{51}$-$10^{53}$ erg) accretion-driven outflows\nin winds and possibly jets, with relativistic jets (if formed) generally\ncapable of breaking out of the BSG envelope. Our modeling points to these\nmerger-origin BSGs as viable progenitors for SN 1987A-like SNe, ultra-long\ngamma-ray bursts, and some of the fast luminous transients found in\nhigh-cadence optical surveys."}

Our constraints for\n$\\Delta z_2$, $\\Delta z_3$ and $\\Delta z_4$ are consistent with those from\nHSC-Y3 cosmic shear modeling. We observe a mild shift in the $\\Delta\nz_3$-$\\Delta z_4$ plane due to the heterogeneous depth of the lens sample,\nwhich disappears when using only DESI-DR1 lenses. Combining shear-ratio\nmeasurements with cosmic shear data, we obtain joint constraints on\ncosmological parameters: $\\Omega_{\\rm m} = 0.286_{-0.074}^{+0.038}$ and $S_8 =\n0.760_{-0.145}^{+0.044}$, consistent with cosmic shear-only results. This work\ndemonstrates the utility of small-scale lensing as an independent probe for\ncalibrating photometric redshift bias in weak lensing cosmology."}

As analysis techniques become more\nsophisticated, e.g. based on deep neural networks, their correct description of\nthe observed event characteristics becomes even more important. Physical\nprocesses occurring in hadronic collisions are simulated within a Monte Carlo\nframework. A major challenge is the modeling of hadron dynamics at low momentum\ntransfer, which includes the initial and final phases of every hadronic\ncollision. Phenomenological models inspired by Quantum Chromodynamics used for\nthese phases cannot guarantee completeness or correctness over the full phase\nspace. These models usually include parameters which must be tuned to suitable\nexperimental data. Until now, event generators have primarily been developed\nand tuned based on data from high-energy physics experiments at accelerators.\nHowever, in many cases they have been found to not satisfactorily describe data\nfrom astroparticle experiments, which provide sensitivity especially to hadrons\nproduced nearly parallel to the collision axis and cover center-of-mass\nenergies up to several hundred TeV, well beyond those reached at colliders so\nfar. In this report, we address the complementarity of these two sets of data\nand present a road map for exploiting, for the first time, their\ncomplementarity by enabling a unified tuning of event generators with\naccelerator-based and astroparticle data."}

Anisotropies are a key discriminator of the origin of\nthis GWB, as they are expected to be at 1--20\\% for astrophysical sources, but\nsuppressed for cosmological GWBs. However, contrary to gravitational wave\ndetectors at higher frequencies, PTAs only take a few independent measurements\nof a GWB and consequently are highly sensitive to cosmic variance, which\ninduces apparent anisotropies in individual realizations of an isotropic GWB.\nWe demonstrate explicitly that statistical inference nevertheless remains\nrobust, i.e., measurements are consistent with the underlying assumption of\nisotropy. This confirms that searches for anisotropies will be able to robustly\ndiscriminate astrophysical from cosmological GWBs.

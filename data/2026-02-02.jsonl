No figures", "summary": "We show that Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG-MOG) is observationally equivalent to the standard model $Λ$CDM cosmological model for all probes that depend on isotropic and linear gravitational dynamics, including galaxy rotation curves, cluster lensing, the linear matter power spectrum P(k), $σ_8$, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This degeneracy arises from the scale-dependent effective gravitational coupling $G_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, which ensures identical background evolution, transfer functions, and linear growth. Consequently, all early-universe, low and intermediate scale cosmological observables are equally well described by STVG-MOG without invoking non-baryonic dark matter. We argue that the equivalence implies that isotropic cosmological data alone cannot establish the physical existence of dark matter. The degeneracy is broken only by observables sensitive to large-scale, anisotropic gravitational response. In particular, recent measurements of enhanced radio-galaxy and quasar number-count dipoles at gigaparsec scales probe a regime where $G_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ departs from its $Λ$CDM limit, allowing STVG-MOG to generate anisotropic bulk flows, while preserving consistency with all isotropic constraints. These observations provide a concrete pathway for empirically distinguishing modified gravity from particle dark matter."}

While this tension is often discussed in terms of new physics or unmodeled systematics, the role of the assumed priors on the model parameters has received comparatively little attention. Recently, Desmond et al. (2025) pointed out that the commonly adopted flat prior on distance moduli upweights smaller distances and systematically favors high inferred values of the Hubble constant. Motivated by this observation, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian recalibration of the distance ladder, applying physically motivated priors uniformly to all distances, including the Milky Way Cepheids, which are incorporated directly into the joint fit. Together with a conservative treatment of the Gaia EDR3 residual parallax offset, the Hubble constant shifts from $H_0 = 73.0 \\pm 1.0 \\, \\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ to $H_0 = 70.6 \\pm 1.0 \\, \\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, reducing the Hubble tension from $5 \\, σ$ to $2 \\, σ$. Our results show that the assumed priors -- often treated as innocuous defaults -- may play a central role in the Hubble tension. Because all local distance ladders rely on the calibration of distances, similar prior-driven effects are expected to arise across distance-ladder methods."}

Our lens model is constrained by a catalogue of 135 secure multiple images from 27 background galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, uniformly covering both subclusters and a wide redshift range of 0.9 - 6.7. We also provide a catalogue of 199 multiple image candidates. We model the cluster with Lenstool and incorporate several large-scale haloes, cluster members, the intracluster gas, and group-scale haloes surrounding the cluster core, motivated by spectroscopic studies of cluster member kinematics. We describe the main cluster component with a complex, elongated double-peaked distribution, and the subcluster with a single large-scale halo aligning closely with the brightest cluster galaxy ($4_{-2}^{+4}$ kpc). The uncertainty of the alignment is improved threefold with the addition of JWST systems. The addition of group-scale substructures, roughly following the two axes of cluster assembly, improves the fit to the multiple image positions and provides a physically motivated alternative to constant shear. Our lens model shows the closest agreement with previous studies in aperture mass profiles at $\\sim60$ kpc from the BCGs, but exhibits significant differences in the detailed mass distribution as a result of different lens-modelling strategies and adopted constraints. The differences are reflected in small but spatially coherent deviations between the new spectroscopic redshifts and redshifts predicted by earlier lens models."}

It is generally assumed that the observation of a black hole with subsolar mass $M_{\\rm obs}$ would provide strong evidence for primordial black holes (PBHs). The mass $M_{\\rm PBH}$ of the PBH, however, does not necessarily have to be equal to $M_{\\rm obs}$, as it would in what we term a ``direct PBH scenario\". Instead, a black hole of mass $M_{\\rm obs}$ may form in a capture of a much smaller primordial black hole, $M_{\\rm PBH} \\ll M_{\\rm obs}$, by a dwarf star of mass $M_* \\simeq M_{\\rm obs}$, followed by the total consumption of the star by the PBH. We provide some rough estimates and demonstrate that such an ``indirect PBH scenario\" may also lead to significant populations of black holes with mass $M_{\\rm obs}$, especially in dwarf galaxies, and may be able to explain rare subsolar mass events."}

Large-scale spatial gradients in this model introduce anisotropic expansion and position-dependent observables, allowing local estimates of $H_{0}$ to shift, dipolar signatures to arise, and an apparently evolving dark-energy equation of state to be mimicked without invoking genuinely dynamical dark energy. We discuss how these effects are constrained once the full supernova, CMB, and large-scale-structure data sets are included, and argue that it remains unclear whether any single $Λ$LTB configuration can simultaneously account for all major anomalies.

Key results/observations summarized in Table 1, which refers readers to the relevant sections for different comparisons. Submitted to the Open Journal of Astrophysics. Comments welcome", "summary": "X-ray luminous cool-core (CC) galaxy clusters contain powerful cosmic ray (CR) sources. High-energy CRs powering GHz synchrotron lose energy rapidly, but long-lived (~Gyr-old) populations of 0.1-1 GeV CRs persist, propagating to ~100 kpc distances and radiating via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons. We explore observable consequences of such CR-IC emission. This produces remarkably thermal X-ray spectra, which could contribute significantly to emission in CC centers. These naturally connect to ultra-steep radio sources and radio mini-halos at younger ages, but become undetectable in most radio, hard-X-ray, and $γ$-ray searches (though future imaging may detect them), while reproducing apparent density, temperature, entropy, and mass deposition rates of CCs. This would provide an alternative resolution of the cooling flow problem: clusters may appear as strong CCs because of strong CR-IC, while not actually cooling so rapidly. This predicts many observed correlations between AGN/jet properties, radio galaxy and minihalo properties, cooling radii, cavity radii and apparent X-ray cooling luminosity $L_{\\rm X,cool}$. Since $L_{\\rm X,cool}$ is actually from CR-IC, the observed radio-X-ray ($L_{\\rm radio}-L_{\\rm X,cool}$), apparent cavity power ($P_{\\rm cav}-L_{\\rm X,cool}-L_{\\rm radio}$), and strong CC-AGN correlations are predicted without free parameters. Since CR-IC leads to X-ray overestimates of thermal pressure, the ratio of SZ to X-ray pressures should drop in CC centers. CR-IC also suppresses abundances inferred from X-ray relative to optical/UV measurements in CC centers. Both of these appear to be seen in sufficiently-resolved CCs. Effects on cluster cosmology, hydrostatic mass estimation, and non-thermal pressure/turbulence estimators are small. Redshift evolution of CC surface brightness profiles could provide strong constraints or imply CR-IC at high-$z$."}

We scan the parameter space of the dipolar magnetic field strength and the initial spin period to determine characteristic optical emission properties and lightcurve timescales of these transients. Additionally, our scan identifies which classes of these transients can reproduce the required diffuse flux level and neutrino energies.

Within a cosmological model containing equal amounts of positive and negative Bondi masses -- consistent with the weak equivalence principle and momentum conservation -- we show that this coupling transition naturally coincides with the shift from a coasting to an accelerating expansion. A linear response analysis of the corresponding Vlasov-Poisson system reveals that mixed positive-negative mass configurations are always unstable, with growth rates that increase at shorter wavelengths, thereby driving the system toward strong coupling. Using long-time, exact one-dimensional N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the universe undergoes three successive expansion phases: an initial ballistic regime, an intermediate random-walk acceleration driven by sporadic Bondi encounters, and finally a uniformly accelerating phase triggered by the formation of stable positive/negative mass pairs. The onset of this last phase occurs precisely when the coupling parameter crosses unity, linking the two cosmological coincidences through a single dynamical mechanism. These results suggest that cosmic acceleration may arise from the nonlinear dynamics of a gravitationally neutral mixed-mass universe, without invoking dark energy or a cosmological constant."}

The two arbitrary functions of the scalar field characterizing the kinetic term and the self-interaction potential are set to $W(\\varphi)=-1$ and $V(\\varphi) = -Ξ\\varphi$, respectively, with $Ξ$ a positive constant. In the weak-field limit, the theory reduces to Refracted Gravity, a non-relativistic theory whose modified Poisson equation contains the scalar field $\\varphi$ that provides the gravitational boost required to describe the dynamics of galaxies and galaxy clusters without dark matter. In a flat, matter-dominated, homogeneous and isotropic universe the same scalar field $\\varphi$ drives the accelerated expansion of the universe and describes the observed redshift evolution of the Hubble-Lemaître parameter $H(z)$. However, in the equation of the growth factor of the linear perturbation theory, the form of $V(\\varphi)$ makes the coefficient of the source of the gravitational field proportional to $H^{-1}(z)$; therefore the gravitational field is strongly suppressed at early times and structure formation is delayed to redshift $z< 1$, in disagreement with the observation of formed galaxies at much larger redshifts. In addition, the form of $W(\\varphi)$ and a linear $V(\\varphi)$ imply that $\\varphi$ generates twice the gravitational boost on massive particles than on photons, with possible observable consequences on the gravitational lensing phenomenon. It remains to be investigated whether different choices of $W(\\varphi)$ and $V(\\varphi)$, that can still make the theory reduce to Refracted Gravity in the weak-field limit, might alleviate these problems."}

Notably, early results showed significant complexity to the Fe-K$α$ line profile in AGN, with clear contributions from at least three emitting structures: an inner disc, intermediary broad line region (BLR) scale material, and an outer torus. This poses a new challenge for the modelling of the emission lines, as while fast sophisticated models exist for disc line-profiles, large scale-height material is typically much more complex. In this paper we aim to address this gap, by building a fully analytic model for the emission line profiles from a wind, aimed towards BLR scale material, motivated on previous reverberation studies suggesting a wind on the inner edge of the BLR. Our approach gives a physically motivated, yet computationally fast, model for the intermediary component to the Fe-K$α$ complex seen in the XRISM data. We demonstrate our model on the XRISM observations of NGC 4151 from the performance verification phase, showing that it gives a good description of the data, with physically reasonable parameters for BLR scale material.

In this study we generate seeds for the above range of SMBHs in various background cosmologies. We consider cosmic timescales required for black hole growth provided by three general relativistic cosmological models ($Λ$CDM, $ω$CDM and Dynamical Dark Energy(DDE) and the braneworld cosmology. The growth of SMBHs is studied through Eddington limited and super-Eddington accretion, where the accretion starts at z=30. It is found that growth of SMBHs by z=10 within Eddington limited accretion is possible through massive seeds $(M\\geq10^{4}M_{\\odot})$ in all cosmologies. Super Eddington accretion onto spinning black holes with mass of few tens of solar masses can result in SMBHs by z=10 in all cosmologies. The viable cosmologies considered here are found to be unable to strongly distinguish between the seed black hole masses. The seeds generated in this work are assumed to be of primordial origin in order to satisfy the criteria of formation of high redshift massive galaxies. The fraction of primordial black holes (PBHs) contributing to dark matter ($f_{PBH}$) and their corresponding number densities for the mass range ($10^{5}-10^{8}$) $M_{\\odot}$ are calculated in both seed effect and Poisson effect. In seed effect, PBHs of mass $\\geq 10^{7} M_{\\odot}$ contributes $\\leq 10^{-2}$ to the dark matter fraction. The evolution of gas mass inside a PBH seeded dark matter halo is studied. The ratio of black hole to stellar mass is also evaluated for star formation efficiency in the range (0.1-1) and found to be ($10^{-3}-1$) for $M_{BH}=10^{8} M_{\\odot}$ and ($10^{-2}-10$) for $M_{BH}=10^{9} M_{\\odot}$."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "X-ray luminous cool-core (CC) galaxy clusters contain powerful cosmic ray (CR) sources. High-energy CRs powering GHz synchrotron lose energy rapidly, but long-lived (~Gyr-old) populations of 0.1-1 GeV CRs persist, propagating to ~100 kpc distances and radiating via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons. We explore observable consequences of such CR-IC emission. This produces remarkably thermal X-ray spectra, which could contribute significantly to emission in CC centers. These naturally connect to ultra-steep radio sources and radio mini-halos at younger ages, but become undetectable in most radio, hard-X-ray, and $γ$-ray searches (though future imaging may detect them), while reproducing apparent density, temperature, entropy, and mass deposition rates of CCs. This would provide an alternative resolution of the cooling flow problem: clusters may appear as strong CCs because of strong CR-IC, while not actually cooling so rapidly. This predicts many observed correlations between AGN/jet properties, radio galaxy and minihalo properties, cooling radii, cavity radii and apparent X-ray cooling luminosity $L_{\\rm X,cool}$. Since $L_{\\rm X,cool}$ is actually from CR-IC, the observed radio-X-ray ($L_{\\rm radio}-L_{\\rm X,cool}$), apparent cavity power ($P_{\\rm cav}-L_{\\rm X,cool}-L_{\\rm radio}$), and strong CC-AGN correlations are predicted without free parameters. Since CR-IC leads to X-ray overestimates of thermal pressure, the ratio of SZ to X-ray pressures should drop in CC centers. CR-IC also suppresses abundances inferred from X-ray relative to optical/UV measurements in CC centers. Both of these appear to be seen in sufficiently-resolved CCs. Effects on cluster cosmology, hydrostatic mass estimation, and non-thermal pressure/turbulence estimators are small. Redshift evolution of CC surface brightness profiles could provide strong constraints or imply CR-IC at high-$z$."}

If these events are confirmed, the high fraction of observed rpTDEs among all tidal disruption events (TDEs) is in tension with prediction of the loss cone channel. We further point out an inequality $M_\\bullet \\lesssim 4\\times 10^6 M_\\odot (T_{\\rm obt}/10\\ {\\rm yr})^{4/9}$ that must be satisfied for rpTDEs of solar type stars in the loss cone channel, where $M_\\bullet$ is the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass and $T_{\\rm obt}$ is the orbital period of the star. However the majority of reported rpTDE candidates potentially violate this inequality, indicating an alternative formation channel. In the commonly invoked Hills mechanism, the captured stars produced by tidal disruption of near-contact binaries can evade this inequality and may be the dominant source of rpTDEs.

Both subclusters exhibit ICM asymmetries consistent with ram-pressure stripping, and PSZ-W displays an X-ray tail extending nearly to the outskirts of PSZ-E. The orientation and length of this tail support an off-axis merger geometry. Thermodynamic maps reveal a hot ($\\sim 7.3$ keV), high-pressure, high-entropy bridge between the cores. From the Rankine-Hugoniot temperature jump, we infer a Mach number $M=1.41^{+0.33}_{-0.30}$, consistent with a weak merger shock propagating at $1620^{+500}_{-420}$ km s$^{-1}$.

Warp influences disc dynamics in ways that have been studied extensively, especially as regards instabilities that might lead to rapid angular-momentum cancellation between neighbouring rings of fluid and mass infall. We provide a review of warped-disc phenomena here, revisiting key hydrodynamical assumptions that impact calculations of the shear viscosity controlling instability thresholds. Relativistic effects at the level of gas-parcel orbits are included, as are external Lorentz forces applied by the compact primary's magnetic field. Semi-analytic analysis reveals that intense magnetic fields can bring about new branches of warp modes and avoided crossings that significantly reduce the perpendicular viscosity at sub-Eddington accretion rates. Critical strengths required for misaligned torques to tear a thin disc may thus relax for systems like neutron star X-ray binaries or radio-loud active galactic nuclei."}

However, classical accretion theory applicable to such hot accretion flows treats spherically symmetric Bondi accretion and disc-like advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) as two distinct limiting cases, lacking a unified framework for flows with finite angular momentum. In this work, we develop such a framework that continuously connects these two regimes. Our model naturally recovers the Bondi solution in the limit of vanishing angular momentum and approaches the properties of classical ADAFs at high angular momentum, while providing a physically well-defined description of the intermediate regime where neither limiting case is strictly applicable. We further demonstrate that the accretion rate is jointly regulated by the angular momentum of the ambient gas and the gas viscosity. For sufficiently large but physically reasonable viscosity, the accretion rate can remain at a significant fraction of the Bondi rate even in the presence of substantial gas rotation. These results offer a natural explanation for how such accretion rates can be sustained despite finite angular momentum in realistic galactic environments."}

To investigate the nature of GRB jets, here we focus on X-ray flares (XFs) and extended emissions (EEs), which are X-ray emissions that occur 100 to 1000 seconds after the main burst. They can be observed by recently developed multi-wavelength facilities. In this paper, we calculate emissions across multi-wavelengths associated with XFs and EEs under the hypothesis that XFs and EEs are optically-thin synchrotron emissions from nonthermal electrons in relativistic jets. Considering ranges of the dissipation radius $r_{\\rm diss}$ and the Lorentz factor $Γ$ of the jet, we determine the parameter space in which a detectable emission can be produced at each wavelength. We found that simultaneous ultraviolet and very-high-energy gamma-ray emission associated with XFs or EEs can be detected by Swift/UVOT, SVOM/VT, and CTAO approximately every three years. The detection and non-detection rates for each detector are key to determining the uncertain yet essential values necessary for understanding the physics of GRB jets."}

These winds often manifest themselves in X-ray spectra as blueshifted, highly ionized absorption lines. Previous observations suggest that the mass loss rate from the disk due to disk winds can be comparable to or even more than the mass accretion rate onto the black hole, indicating that disk winds likely play crucial roles in shaping the accretion disk structure and affecting the surrounding environment. However, the mechanisms driving these winds, as well as how their structure changes in response to variations in the mass accretion rate, remain poorly understood. The X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM), launched in September 2023, is equipped with Resolve, a cutting-edge X-ray micro-calorimeter that delivers unprecedented spectral resolution.

We consider a Fishbone--Moncrief torus orbiting a Kerr black hole with spin parameter $a = 0.9375$, threaded by large-scale magnetic fields that are asymmetric about the equatorial plane. The degree of equatorial asymmetry in the magnetic field is parametrized by an angle, with values of $30^\\circ$, $45^\\circ$, and $60^\\circ$. We examine how this equatorially asymmetric initial magnetic field configuration influences the magnetic field structure, accretion flow morphology, and angular momentum transport across a range of initial plasma beta values ($β= 0.007, 0.005, 0.001$). We find that such deformation in the magnetic field leads to noticeable changes in the inner disk structure, asymmetric outflow patterns in the poloidal plane, and time-dependent variations in accretion rates. These effects are generally more pronounced at lower beta values, where magnetic pressure dominates; in particular, the $30^\\circ$ case at $β= 0.001$ exhibits strong and persistent asymmetric inflows and outflows. Our results demonstrate that equatorially asymmetric magnetic field configurations can significantly influence the structure and variability of relativistic accretion flows.

In this study, we present a multi-wavelength and multi-messenger analysis to investigate the physical origin of this emission. Swift-XRT monitoring reveals a quasi-quiescent state characterized by a low X-ray flux. Modeling the broadband spectral energy distribution with the leptohadronic code AMES, we find that a standard one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model underpredicts the VHE flux by $\\sim$70% due to the insufficient target photon density provided by the weak X-ray emission, unless a high Doppler factor ($δ\\gtrsim 5$) is invoked. Alternatively, an external inverse-Compton (EIC) scenario-scattering seed photons from a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF)-successfully reproduces the broadband spectral energy distribution with a modest jet power and Doppler factor.

The CO($1-0$) map exhibits an increased\nfilamentary behaviour and larger contribution from sheets than the $21$-cm map.\nWe attempt to explain such an emission of the CO($1-0$) line from biased\nenvironments. The upcoming SKA-Mid will produce tomographic intensity maps of\nthe $21$-cm signal at $z \\lesssim 3$ in Band-1. CO maps can be produced at\nthese redshifts in phase 2 of SKA-Mid, where the frequency coverage is expected\nto increase up to $\\sim 50$ GHz. We present forecasts for the recovery of the\nlocal dimensions of these intensity maps contaminated by instrumental noise,\nconsidering SKA-Mid observations."}

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have traditionally been classified by\nduration into long (LGRBs) and short (SGRBs), with the former believed to\noriginate from massive star collapses and the latter from compact binary\nmergers. However, events such as the SGRB 200826A (coming from a collapsar) and\nthe LGRBs 211211A and 230307A (associated with a merger) suggest that\nduration-based classification could be sometimes misleading. Recently, the\nminimum variability timescale (MVT) has emerged as a key metric for classifying\nGRBs.\n  Aims. We calculate the MVT, defined as the full width at half maximum (FWHM)\nof the narrowest pulse in the light curve, using an independent dataset from\nFermi/GBM and we compare our results with other MVT definitions. We update the\nMVT-T90 plane and analyse peculiar events like long-duration merger candidates\n211211A, 230307A, and other short GRBs with extended emission (SEE-GRBs). We\nalso examine extragalactic magnetar giant flares (MGFs) and explore possible\nnew correlations with peak energy.\n  Methods. We used the MEPSA algorithm to identify the shortest pulse in each\nGRB light curve and measure its FWHM. We calculated the MVT for around 3700\nGRBs, 177 of which with spectroscopically known redshift.\n  Results. SEE-GRBs and SGRBs share similar MVTs (from few tens to a few\nhundreds of ms), indicating a common progenitor, while extragalactic MGFs\nexhibit even shorter values (from few ms to few tens of ms). Our MVT estimation\nmethod consistently yields higher values than another existing technique, the\nlatter aligning with the pulse rise time. For LGRBs, we confirmed the\ncorrelations of MVT with peak luminosity and Lorentz factor.\n  Conclusions. We confirmed that, although MVT alone cannot determine the GRB\nprogenitor, it is a valuable tool when combined with other indicators, helping\nto flag long-duration mergers and distinguish MGFs from typical SGRBs."}

*Lieke Sippens Groenewegen,Sanjana Curtis,Philipp Mösta,Daniel Kasen,Daniel Brethauer*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究了从超质量中子星（HMNS）残骸的三维广义相对论磁流体动力学（GRMHD）模拟中产生的千新星发射，探讨了不同$r$-过程加热率的影响及其对观测结果的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索千新星发射的物理机制，特别是HMNS残骸的磁化流出对蓝色千新星（如AT2017gfo）的解释能力。

Method: 使用3D GRMHD模拟HMNS残骸的流出，通过FLASH流体动力学代码模拟其膨胀，并利用Sedona辐射传输代码计算千新星的光谱演化和光变曲线。

Result: 千新星特性依赖于残骸寿命和观测角度，长寿命残骸产生更亮的千新星，且观测角度对光变曲线有显著影响。

Conclusion: 自洽的长期模拟和考虑观测角度对解释千新星光变曲线至关重要，磁化流出可能是蓝色千新星的解释之一。

Abstract: We investigate the kilonova emission resulting from outflows produced in a
three-dimensional (3D) general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD)
simulation of a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) remnant. We map the outflows
into the FLASH hydrodynamics code to model their expansion in axisymmetry, and
study the effects of employing different $r$-process heating rates. Except for
the highest heating rate prescription, we find no significant differences with
respect to overall ejecta dynamics and morphology compared to the simulation
without heating. Once homologous expansion is attained, typically after $\sim$
2s for these ejecta, we map the outflows to the Sedona radiative transfer code
and compute the spectral evolution of the kilonova and broadband light curves
in various LSST bands. The kilonova properties depend on the remnant lifetime,
with peak luminosities and peak timescales increasing for longer-lived remnants
that produce more massive ejecta. For all models, there is a strong dependence
of both the bolometric and broadband light curves on the viewing angle. While
the short-lived (12ms) remnant produces higher luminosities when viewed from
angles closer to the pole, longer-lived remnants (240ms and 2.5s) are more
luminous when viewed from angles closer to the equator. Our results highlight
the importance of self-consistent, long-term modeling of merger ejecta, and
taking viewing-angle dependence into account when interpreting observed
kilonova light curves. We find that magnetized outflows from a HMNS -- if it
survives long enough -- could explain blue kilonovae, such as the blue emission
seen in AT2017gfo.

Abstract: While much work has gone into associating neutrino emission with various
sources, very few sources have emerged. With the recent publication of IceCube
Event Catalog (IceCat-1), the IceCube neutrino observatory has released a list
of the most promising astrophysical neutrino events since operations began in
2010. Using the archival data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC)
gamma-ray observatory, we perform a coincidence search for gamma rays and
neutrinos using a Bayesian Block algorithm with the public IceCube alerts from
IceCat-1 and the Astrophysical Multi-messenger Observatory Network (AMON). Of
the 350 alerts considered, 25 detections were found, with 1 coinciding with the
flaring HAWC source Markarian 421, an active galactic nuclei. We present the
performance of this method and a discussion of physics implications.

TL;DR: GRB 240825A是一个介于短和长伽马暴之间的混合特征事件，通过多波段分析和机器学习分类技术，发现其可能起源于大质量恒星坍缩，但未检测到超新星或千新星。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GRB 240825A的分类和起源，以理解其混合特征和可能的物理机制。

Method: 使用经典和现代分类技术（如机器学习）分析GRB 240825A的持续时间、能量等特征，并进行光学和近红外观测以寻找超新星或宿主星系。

Result: GRB 240825A表现出混合特征，可能起源于大质量恒星坍缩，但未检测到超新星或千新星。宿主星系为典型的坍缩星伽马暴宿主。

Conclusion: GRB 240825A可能源于大质量恒星坍缩，但超新星被尘埃遮蔽或光度较低。研究强调多波段观测和多层次分类的重要性。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis of GRB 240825A, a bright
gamma-ray burst (GRB) detected by Fermi and Swift, with a prompt duration
($T_{\rm 90}$ ~ 4 sec in 50-300 keV) near the boundary separating short and
long GRBs, prompting a detailed investigation into its classification and
progenitor. Using classical prompt metrics (duration, minimum variability
timescale (MVT), lag, and spectral hardness) and modern classification
techniques (machine-learning (ML) based t-SNE, support vector machine,
energy-hardness-duration, and $\epsilon \equiv E_{\gamma,\mathrm{iso},52} /
E_{p,z,2}^{5/3}$), we find GRB 240825A exhibits hybrid characteristics. The
short MVT (13.830 $\pm$ 1.574 ms), rest-frame duration, and ML-based
classification indicate a merger-like or ambiguous nature, while its energetics
and position on the Amati relation favor a collapsar origin. We conducted deep
optical and NIR photometric and spectroscopic late-time search for an
associated supernova (SN)/kilonova (KN) and the host galaxy using 10.4 m GTC
and 8.4 m binocular LBT telescopes. No bright SN (like SN 1998bw) is detected
down to stringent limits (e.g., $m_r > 26.1$ mag at 17.59 days), despite a
redshift of $z$ = 0.659 measured from GTC spectroscopy. Host galaxy SED
modeling with Prospector indicates a massive, dusty, and star-forming
galaxy-typical of collapsar GRB hosts, though with low sSFR and large offset.
We compare these findings with hybrid events like GRB 211211A, GRB 230307A, GRB
200826A, including SNe-GRBs, and conclude that GRB 240825A likely originated
from a massive star collapse, with the associated supernova obscured by a dusty
host environment or low luminosity SN with absolute magnitude M$_{V}$ fainter
than -18.0. This study emphasizes the need for multiwavelength follow-up and a
multi-layered classification to determine GRB progenitors.

Abstract: Soft X-ray emission from neutron stars affords powerful diagnostic tools for
uncovering their surface and interior properties, as well as their geometric
configurations. In the atmospheres of neutron stars, the presence of magnetic
fields alters the photon-electron scattering cross sections, resulting in
non-trivial angular dependence of intensity and polarization of the emergent
signals. This paper presents recent developments of our Monte Carlo simulation,
MAGTHOMSCATT, which tracks the complex electric field vector for each photon
during its transport. Our analysis encompasses the anisotropy and polarization
characteristics of X-ray emission for field strengths ranging from non-magnetic
to extremely magnetized regimes that are germane to magnetars. In the very low
field domain, we reproduced the numerical solution to the radiative transfer
equation for non-magnetic Thomson scattering, and provided analytical fits for
the angular dependence of the intensity and the polarization degree. These fits
can be useful for studies of millisecond pulsars and magnetic white dwarfs. By
implementing a refined injection protocol, we show that, in the magnetar
regime, the simulated intensity and polarization pulse profiles of emission
from extended surface regions becomes invariant with respect to the ratio of
photon ($\omega$) and electron cyclotron ($\omega_{\rm B}$) frequencies once
$\omega / \omega_{\rm B} \lesssim 0.01$. This circumvents the need for
simulations pertinent to really high magnetic field strengths, which are
inherently slower. Our approach will be employed elsewhere to model
observational data to constrain neutron star geometric parameters and
properties of emitting hot spots on their surfaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索长时伽马暴（GRBs）的起源和中心引擎机制，尤其是通过观测QPO信号来验证其与黑洞喷流进动的关系。

Method: 分析GRB 220711B的X射线余辉数据，检测QPO信号，并结合γ射线光变曲线和能量注入特征进行验证。

Result: 发现低频QPO信号（~0.02 Hz），支持喷流进动假设，并表明GRB可能源自恒星合并引起的核心坍缩。

Conclusion: GRB 220711B的QPO信号揭示了长时GRB的新形成通道，挑战了传统的坍缩星模型。

Abstract: It is generally believed that long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate
from the core collapse of rapidly spinning massive stars and at least some of
them are powered by hyper-accreting black holes. However, definite proofs about
the progenitor and central engine of these GRBs have not been directly observed
in the past. Here we report the existence of a Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO)
signature with periodic frequency $\sim$0.02 Hz in the early X-ray afterglow
phase of GRB 220711B. Such a low-frequency QPO likely signals the precession of
a relativistic jet launched from a GRB hyper-accreting black hole central
engine. The energy injection signature from the \textbf{late} X-ray
observations (from $5\times 10^2s\sim 1\times10^4s$) is consistent with the
precession hypothesis. The prompt $\gamma$-ray light curve does not show any
QPO signature, suggesting that the X-ray flaring emission in the early
afterglow phase and prompt emission likely originate from different accretion
processess, indicating that the progenitor stars of GRBs have a core-envelope
structure with a stratified angular momentum distribution and the late-time
accretion disk likely has a misalignment with respect to the rotation axis of
the black hole. Such a misalignment is not expected in a canonical collapsar
model. As a result, the QPO signature in GRB 220711B may reveal a new formation
channel of long GRBs, possibly a stellar-merger-induced core collapse, with the
orbital angular momentum of the binary misaligned with the spin axis of the
collapsing star.

Method: 分析伽马射线和X射线余辉的光变曲线，检测QPO信号，并提出超质量磁星预旋模型。

Result: X射线余辉中发现6σ置信度的50秒QPO信号，磁星参数P0和Bp分别为[1.87,6.25]ms和[1.47×10^16,3.09×10^16]G。

Conclusion: 超质量磁星预旋模型能合理解释GRB 220711B的观测特征，磁星参数与典型长暴一致但Bp略高。

Abstract: The $\gamma$-ray light curve of long-duration GRB 220711B, is characterized
by a multi-peaked structure with a duration lasting $\sim$105 seconds. More
interestingly, the X-ray afterglow light curve is composed of a plateau
emission smoothly connected with a $\sim t^{-2}$ segment overlapping some
flares followed by an extremely steep decay. By analysing the light curves of
both prompt emission and X-ray afterglow, no high-confidence-level
quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) signals are found in the light curves of the
prompt emission (e.g., BAT and GBM), but it is found that a QPO signal at
$\sim$ 50 s above 6$\sigma$ confidence level indeed exist in the X-ray
afterglow. Here, we propose that a supra-massive magnetar as the central engine
of GRB 220711B with precession motion is a good interpretation of the features
of the X-ray emission. The initial plateau emission and followed decay segment,
as well as the extremely steep-decay segment, are consistent with the physical
process of supra-massive magnetar spin-down and then collapse into black hole.
Moreover, the QPO signal in the X-ray emission can be explained as an effect of
the precession motion of the magnetar. If this is the case, one can derive
various magnetar parameters such as the initial period ($P_{{\rm{0}}}$) and
surface magnetic field strength ($B_{{\rm{p}}}$) within a pseudo-redshift range
of [1.08, 4.27]. By considering beaming corrections with jet opening angle
$5^{\circ}$, we find that $P_{{\rm{0}}}$ and $B_{{\rm{p}}}$ lie within the
range of [1.87, 6.25] ms and [$1.47\times 10^{16}$, $3.09\times 10^{16}$] G,
respectively. The parameter of $B_{{\rm{p}}}$ is slightly larger than that of
other typical long-duration GRBs, but $P_{{\rm{0}}}$ fall in a reasonable
range.

Abstract: The first detection of an optical counterpart to a gravitational wave signal
revealed that collaborative efforts between instruments with different
specializations provide a unique opportunity to acquire impactful
multi-messenger data. We present results of such a joint search with the Dark
Energy Camera (DECam) and Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) for the optical
counterpart of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA event S250328ae, a binary black hole merger
candidate of high significance detected at a distance of 511$\pm$82 Mpc and
localized within an area of 3 (15) square degrees at 50% (90%) confidence. We
observed the 90% confidence area with DECam and identified 36 high-confidence
transient candidates after image processing, candidate selection, and candidate
vetting. We observed with PFS to obtain optical spectra of DECam candidates,
Swift-XRT candidates, and potential host galaxies of S250328ae. In total, 3897
targets were observed by seven pointings covering ~50% of the 90% confidence
area. After template fitting and visual inspection, we identified 12 SNe, 159
QSOs, 2975 galaxies, and 131 stars. With the joint observations of DECam and
PFS, we found variability in 12 SNe, 139 QSOs, 37 galaxies, and 2 stars. We do
not identify any confident optical counterparts, though the association is not
ruled out for three variable candidates that are not observed by PFS and 6 QSO
candidates without clear variability if the optical counterpart of S250328ae is
faint. Despite the lack of confident optical counterparts, this paper serves as
a framework for future collaborations between wide-field imagers and
multi-object spectrographs to maximize multi-messenger analyses.

Conclusion: NE喷流在喷射最深爆炸燃烧层物质中起关键作用，揭示了核心坍缩超新星内部不对称性的新机制。

Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae drive nucleosynthesis under extreme thermodynamic
conditions, and complex mechanisms are at work prompting the transport of heavy
elements from deep stellar interiors into outer layers. We present spatially
resolved X-ray spectroscopy of Cassiopeia A's (Cas A) northeastern (NE) jet
using the archival 1 Ms Chandra/ACIS observations, and focusing on three
fingers of the jet. We report the highest Cr/Fe mass ratio (Cr/Fe $\sim0.14$)
ever observed in Cas A, localized in a compact region within the southernmost
finger in the NE jet. Comparisons with nucleosynthesis models indicate that the
NE jet originated approximately at the boundary separating the complete Si
burning layer from the incomplete Si-burning layer. We also find that mixing
from different layers is needed to explain the chemical composition of the
three fingers in the NE jet. We also detect significant differences in the
physical and chemical properties among the three fingers analyzed of the NE
jet. In particular, we find that, unlike the other two, the southernmost finger
originated from a slightly more peripheral region of the explosion. Moreover,
while the northern and central fingers lie almost in the plane of the sky, the
southernmost finger is moving in a different direction, showing a velocity
along the line of sight of $\sim2100$ km s$^{-1}$ towards the observer, with a
tilt angle of $\sim16$\textdegree. These findings highlight the NE jet's role
in ejecting material from the deepest explosive burning layers, providing new
insights into the asymmetries originating in the inner layers of core-collapse
supernovae.

Method: 分析了均匀和非均匀电子分布在球形和圆柱形发射区域中的辐射各向异性，计算了数值修正因子，并比较了不同简化假设下的吸收效应。

Result: 对于3D高斯分布的电子，辐射通量比均匀分布低0.222倍；均匀球体的吸收效应可用均匀平板近似，而高斯分布的吸收较弱。

Conclusion: 几何形状和电子分布对辐射产生和吸收有显著影响，需在建模中考虑这些因素以提高准确性。

Abstract: We investigate the geometrical effects affecting the production and
absorption of gamma-ray radiation emitted in inverse Compton scattering in the
synchrotron-self-Compton process. We evaluate the effect of the anisotropy of
the radiation field seen by the scattering electrons homogeneously distributed
in the emission region. Next, we also consider inhomogeneous distribution of
electrons and investigate the effect of it in the spherically symmetric
emission region. We also study a cylindrical shape of the emission region and
its effect on the isotropy of the emitted radiation. We obtain simple numerical
factors that scale the emission for different assumptions about the geometry of
the emission region and the distribution of the emitting electrons. For a 3D
Gaussian spatial distribution of the electrons we obtain 0.222 times lower flux
than for homogeneous emission region. Finally, we also evaluate the absorption
of the radiation produced in the different scenarios, and compare the full
calculations with the two most commonly assumed simplifications. We find that
for cases when the absorption is lesser than by one order of magnitude, the
full calculations for homogeneous sphere can be well approximated with
homogeneously-emitting slab, while the absorption in the case of 3D Gaussian
distribution of electrons is significantly weaker.

TL;DR: 通过分析LHAASO观测到的GRB 221009A光子飞行时间和时间偏移数据，使用DisCan方法和信息熵作为成本函数，研究了洛伦兹对称性破坏的迹象，并给出了洛伦兹不变性破坏能量尺度的下限约束。

Motivation: 洛伦兹对称性是现代物理学的基石，验证其有效性是重要课题。通过观测伽马射线暴数据，可以探索洛伦兹对称性破坏的可能性。

Method: 采用DisCan方法，以不同信息熵（如香农熵）作为成本函数，结合WCDA光子和Knuth分箱法优化分析。

Result: 在95%置信水平下，线性情况（n=1）和二次情况（n=2）的洛伦兹不变性破坏能量尺度下限分别为5.4×10^19 GeV（亚光速）、2.7×10^19 GeV（超光速）和10.0×10^12 GeV（亚光速）、2.4×10^12 GeV（超光速）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，使用不同信息熵作为成本函数不会显著改变约束的数量级，香农熵因其无参数统计特性提供了稳定可靠的结果。

Abstract: Lorentz symmetry is a cornerstone of modern physics, and testing its validity
remains a critical endeavor. In this work, we analyze the photon time-of-flight
and time-shift data from LHAASO observations of Gamma-Ray Burst GRB 221009A to
search for signatures of Lorentz violation. We employed the DisCan (dispersion
cancellation) method with various information entropies as cost functions,
designating the results obtained with Shannon entropy as our representative
outcome. This choice is attributed to the parameter-free statistical properties
of Shannon entropy, which has demonstrated remarkable stability as we
continually refine and enhance our methodology. In the absence of more detailed
data and physical context, it provides more stable and reliable results. We
constrain the energy scale associated with Lorentz invariance violation. Our
results yield 95\% confidence level lower limits of $E_{\text{QG},1} > 5.4
\times 10^{19} \, \text{GeV}$ (subluminal) and $E_{\text{QG},1} > 2.7 \times
10^{19} \, \text{GeV}$ (superluminal) for the linear case ($n$=1), and
$E_{\text{QG},2} > 10.0 \times 10^{12} \, \text{GeV}$ (subluminal) and
$E_{\text{QG},2} > 2.4 \times 10^{12} \, \text{GeV}$ (superluminal) for the
quadratic case ($n$=2). Subsequently, we incorporated WCDA photons and the
Knuth binning method to further optimize and complement our approach, while
also performing filter using information entropies. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that employing different information entropy measures as cost functions does
not alter the order of magnitude of these constraints.

and those resulting from the first six months of eROSITA all-sky survey
(eRASS1). We focus on the subset of quasars bright enough in the optical/UV
band to avoid an ''Eddington bias'' towards X-ray brighter-than-average
spectral energy distributions. The final samples include 1,248 and 519 sources
for eFEDS and eRASS1, up to redshift $z\approx3$ and $z\approx1.5$,
respectively. We found that the X-ray$-$UV luminosity relation shows no
significant evolution with redshift, and its slope is in perfect agreement with
previous compilations of quasar samples. The intrinsic dispersion of the
relation is about 0.2 dex, which is small enough for possible cosmological
applications. However, the limited redshift range and statistics of the current
samples do not allow us to obtain significant cosmological constraints yet. We
show how this is going to change with the future releases of the eROSITA data.

Abstract: The formation of dark-matter halos from small cosmological perturbations
generated in the early universe is a highly non-linear process typically
modeled through N-body simulations. In this work, we explore the use of deep
learning to segment and classify proto-halo regions in the initial density
field according to their final halo mass at redshift $z=0$. We compare two
architectures: a fully convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the V-Net
design and a U-Net transformer. We find that the transformer-based network
significantly outperforms the CNN across all metrics, achieving sub-percent
error in the total segmented mass per halo class. Both networks deliver much
higher accuracy than the perturbation-theory-based model \textsc{pinocchio},
especially at low halo masses and in the detailed reconstruction of proto-halo
boundaries. We also investigate the impact of different input features by
training models on the density field, the tidal shear, and their combination.
Finally, we use Grad-CAM to generate class-activation heatmaps for the CNN,
providing preliminary yet suggestive insights into how the network exploits the
input fields.

Abstract: We present predictions for redshift-space peculiar velocity statistics in the
Lagrangian and Eulerian formulations of the effective field theory (EFT) of
large-scale structure. We compute 2-point pairwise velocity statistics up to
the second moment at next-to-leading (1-loop) order, showing that they can be
modeled together with redshift-space galaxy densities with a consistent set of
EFT coefficients. We show that peculiar velocity statistics have a distinct
dependence on long-wavelength bulk flows that necessitates a variation on the
usual infrared (IR) resummation procedure used to model baryon acoustic
oscillations (BAO) in galaxy clustering. This can be implemented recursively in
powers of the velocity in both the Lagrangian and Eulerian frameworks. We
validate our analytic calculations against fully nonlinear N-body simulations,
demonstrating that they can be used to recover the growth rate at better than
percent level precision, well beyond the statistical requirements of upcoming
peculiar velocity surveys and measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich
(kSZ) effect. As part of this work, we release $\texttt{velocisaurus}$, a fast
$\texttt{Python}$ code for computing EFT predictions of peculiar velocity
statistics.

TL;DR: 研究银河尘埃前景复杂性对张量-标量比（$r$）测量的影响，发现尘埃频率谱的空间变化可能导致$r$的估计偏差，但扩展参数方法仍能在多数情况下提供无偏估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨银河尘埃复杂性对宇宙微波背景（CMB）中$r$测量的潜在偏差，特别是在西蒙斯天文台的背景下。

Method: 使用包含真实银河尘埃辐射的模拟数据，通过交叉谱分量分离分析，评估低阶矩展开方法对$r$估计的影响。

Result: 发现尘埃频率谱的空间变化会导致$r$的显著偏差（高达$r\sim0.03$），但扩展参数方法能有效减少偏差。

Conclusion: 在高尘埃复杂性情况下，需采用更灵活的前景模型以确保$r$的无偏估计。

Abstract: We investigate how dust foreground complexity can affect measurements of the
tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, in the context of the Simons Observatory, using a
cross-spectrum component separation analysis. Employing a suite of simulations
with realistic Galactic dust emission, we find that spatial variation in the
dust frequency spectrum, parametrized by $\beta_d$, can bias the estimate for
$r$ when modeled using a low-order moment expansion to capture this spatial
variation. While this approach performs well across a broad range of dust
complexity, the bias increases with more extreme spatial variation in dust
frequency spectrum, reaching as high as $r\sim0.03$ for simulations with no
primordial tensors and a spatial dispersion of $\sigma(\beta_d)\simeq0.3$ --
the most extreme case considered, yet still consistent with current
observational constraints. This bias is driven by changes in the
$\ell$-dependence of the dust power spectrum as a function of frequency that
can mimic a primordial $B$-mode tensor signal. Although low-order moment
expansions fail to capture the full effect when the spatial variations of
$\beta_d$ become large and highly non-Gaussian, our results show that extended
parametric methods can still recover unbiased estimates of $r$ under a wide
range of dust complexities. We further find that the bias in $r$, at the
highest degrees of dust complexity, is largely insensitive to the spatial
structure of the dust amplitude and is instead dominated by spatial
correlations between $\beta_d$ and dust amplitude, particularly at higher
orders. If $\beta_d$ does spatially vary at the highest levels investigated
here, we would expect to use more flexible foreground models to achieve an
unbiased constraint on $r$ for the noise levels anticipated from the Simons
Observatory.

Motivation: 探究引力常数G是否随时间或空间变化，利用天体物理数据验证G的可能变化。

Method: 采用两种G(z)参数化模型，结合158个透镜系统和Pantheon+样本数据，分析G的变化及其对Ia型超新星光度的影响。

Result: 结果显示G的变化不显著，但误差范围较大，无法完全排除G变化的可能性。

Conclusion: 未来调查可能进一步优化约束条件，验证G的潜在变化。

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the potential variation of the gravitational
constant $G$ using data from strong gravitational lensing systems and Type Ia
supernovae. Testing $G(z)$ parameterizations where $G(z) = G_0(1 + G_1z)$ and
$G(z) = G_0(1 + z)^{G_1}$, we also account for the influence of $G$ on the
luminosity of SNe Ia through the Chandrasekhar mass-luminosity relation. Only
the flat universe hypothesis is considered. Constraints from 158 lensing
systems and the Pantheon+ sample show no significant evidence of $G$ variation.
However, although the results are compatible with no variation, the errors are
not yet sufficiently restrictive to rule out any variation of $G$ with high
statistical confidence. This study highlights the viability of using combined
astrophysical data to probe variations in fundamental constants, suggesting
that future surveys could refine these constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解早期宇宙在QCD相变期间的演化轨迹，特别是在轻子不对称性存在的情况下，如何影响宇宙的冷却过程。

Method: 通过同时求解重子数、电荷和轻子不对称性守恒，结合最新的晶格QCD状态方程（包含粲夸克贡献），计算了宇宙冷却过程中的轨迹。

Result: 轻子不对称性增加会推动轨迹向更大的重子化学势和更负的电荷化学势移动；在不对称情况下，轨迹会出现非单调反弹。所有研究的轻子不对称性轨迹均表明QCD相变是平滑的交叉。

Conclusion: 在标准宇宙学情景下，QCD相变几乎肯定是平滑的交叉，但研究提供了接近QCD临界点所需的轻子和重子不对称性估计，为未来研究提供了输入。

Abstract: We compute the full cosmic trajectories of the early Universe across the QCD
phase diagram as the plasma cools from $T\simeq500\,$MeV to $30\,$MeV, assuming
$\beta$-equilibrated matter. The trajectories are obtained by simultaneously
solving baryon-number, electric-charge, and lepton-asymmetry conservation,
closed by a state-of-the-art lattice-QCD equation of state: a fourth-order
Taylor expansion in the chemical potentials that merges the latest
$(2\!+\!1)$-flavor susceptibilities with charm-quark contributions, thus
delivering a consistent $(2\!+\!1\!+\!1)$-flavor equation of state. Results are
compared with an ideal quark-gluon plasma and with a hadron-resonance gas to
highlight interaction effects. Two cases of primordial lepton asymmetries are
analyzed: a symmetric configuration $(\ell_e=\ell_\mu=\ell_\tau=\ell/3)$ and an
asymmetric one $(\ell_e=0,\;\ell_\mu=-\ell_\tau)$. Increasing $|\ell|$
systematically drives the trajectories toward larger values of $\mu_B$ and more
negative $\mu_Q$. In the asymmetric case, a non-monotonic bounce develops when
the $\tau$ chemical potential reaches $m_\tau$, generating a maximum in
$\mu_B(T)$, the position of which depends on $\ell_\tau$. Assuming a modest
$\mu_{Q}$-dependence of the lattice-QCD critical end point estimates (obtained
at $\mu_{Q} = 0$), the trajectories for all lepton asymmetries explored
($|\ell|\lesssim 0.1$) lie to their left, implying that in a standard
cosmological scenario the QCD transition is almost certainly a smooth
crossover. Nevertheless, we estimate the magnitude of baryon and lepton
asymmetries needed to obtain a cosmic trajectory closer to the QCD critical
point, providing inputs for future studies of the strong-interaction epoch.

Abstract: We compute the two-loop effective field theory (EFT) power spectrum of dark
matter density fluctuations in $\Lambda$CDM using the recently proposed COBRA
method (Bakx. et al, 2025). With COBRA, we are able to evaluate the two-loop
matter power spectrum in $\sim 1$ millisecond at $ \sim 0.1 \%$ precision on
one CPU for arbitrary redshifts and on scales where perturbation theory
applies. As an application, we use the nonlinear matter power spectrum from the
Dark Sky simulation to assess the performance of the two-loop EFT power
spectrum compared to the one-loop EFT power spectrum at $z=0$. We find that,
for volumes typical for Stage IV galaxy surveys, $V = 25 \,(\text{Gpc}/h)^3$,
the two-loop EFT can provide unbiased cosmological constraints on
$\Omega_m,H_0$ and $A_s$ using scales up to $k_\text{max}=0.26\, h/\text{Mpc}$,
thereby outperforming the constraints from the one-loop EFT
($k_\text{max}=0.11\, h/\text{Mpc}$). The Figure of Merit on these three
parameters increases by a factor $\sim 1.9$ and the one-dimensional
marginalized constraints improve by $\sim35\%$ for $\Omega_m$, $\sim20\%$ for
$H_0$ and $\sim 15\%$ for $A_s$.

Abstract: Cosmic microwave background data from the Planck satellite, combined with
baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument and Type Ia supernovae from various samples, provide hints of
dynamical dark energy (DE). These results indicate a peak in the DE density
around $z\sim 0.4-0.5$, with the highest significance observed when using the
supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey. In this Letter, we show that this peak
does not necessarily imply a true crossing of the phantom divide if the
measured effective DE is not a single component, but a combination of standard
and negative quintessence. The latter is characterized by negative energy
density and positive pressure, both decreasing in absolute value and tending to
0 in the future. For appropriate values of the parameters, negative
quintessence is relevant at intermediate redshifts and becomes subdominant in
front of standard quintessence around $z\sim 0.4-0.5$, giving rise to the
aforementioned peak in the DE density. We find that our model is preferred over
$\Lambda$CDM at a $3.27\sigma$ CL, which is comparable to the level of
exclusion found with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization. Our
analysis leaves open the possibility of negative quintessence and other exotic
fields existing in the low-energy universe, potentially playing a significant
role in cosmic dynamics.

Abstract: The magnitude gap between the central and satellite galaxies encodes
information about the mass accretion history of a dark matter halo, and serves
as a useful observational probe for the mass distribution in a halo. In this
work, we perform the first weak lensing test of the connections between the
magnitude gap and the halo profile. We measure the halo profiles of isolated
central galaxies (ICGs) selected primarily from the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample.
Halo mass and concentration are inferred by fitting stacked lensing profiles in
bins of central luminosity, $L_\mathrm{c}$, and the central-satellite magnitude
gap, $L_\mathrm{gap}$. We detect dependence on the magnitude gap in both halo
properties. The dependence is the strongest in the ICG luminosity range of
$10^{10.3}<L_\mathrm{c}[h^{-2}L_\odot]\leq 10^{10.7}$, where halos with smaller
gaps have higher masses and lower concentrations. When $10^{10.7}
<L_c[h^{-2}L_\odot] \leq 10^{11.1}$, however, no significant gap dependence is
detected. In the range of $10^{9.9}<L_\mathrm{c}[h^{-2}L_\odot] \leq
10^{10.3}$, a disordering of the gap dependence is marginally observable. We
compare the observational results with predictions by two lightcone catalogs
built from the Illustris TNG300 and the Millennium simulations. The gap
dependence in the two mock samples show overall consistency with observations,
but neither matches them in all $L_\mathrm{c}$ bins to a quantitative level. We
also compare the significance of the gap dependence on halo mass and
concentration and find that our measurement prefers gap dependence in both
parameters, while the halo mass dependence is preferred over the concentration
if only one of the two dependencies is allowed.

Conclusion: 简单的引力坍缩模型可以解释磁场谱演化的主要特征。

Abstract: The origin of large scale magnetic fields in the Universe is widely thought
to be from early Universe processes, like inflation or phase transitions. These
magnetic fields evolve via magnetohydrodynamic processes until the epoch of
recombination. When structures begin to form in the later Universe, the
conservation of magnetic flux amplifies the magnetic fields via the adiabatic
collapse of gravitationally bound gas clouds hosting the magnetic fields and
moves them to smaller scales. In this work, we have semi-analytically studied
this forward cascade effect, considering simple models of gravitational
collapse of structures. We find that this simple model is able to reproduce the
general qualitative features of the evolution of the magnetic field spectrum as
seen from magnetized cosmological simulations.

Result: CMB数据支持旋转参数可忽略，晚期数据允许更高旋转但导致σ8矛盾。综合数据倾向于无旋转。

Conclusion: 当前数据更支持无旋转的宇宙学模型，与标准ΛCDM一致。

Abstract: We investigate a relativistic cosmological model with background rotation,
sourced by a non-perfect fluid with anisotropic stress. A modified version of
the CLASS Boltzmann code is employed to perform MCMC analyses against Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) and late-time datasets. The results show that
current CMB data constrain the present-day rotation parameter to be negligible.
As a consequence, the derived cosmological parameters remain consistent with
the standard $\Lambda$CDM values. In contrast, late-time probes such as Type Ia
supernovae (SNe) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) allow for a higher
level of rotation and yield an increased Hubble constant. However, this comes
at the cost of a higher $\sigma_8$, which remains in tension with DES-Y3
measurement. Combining CMB, SNe and BAO data confirms the preference for
non-rotation.

Abstract: Axion inflation is a well-motivated model of cosmic inflation with a rich
phenomenology. The abundant production of gauge fields during axion inflation
notably sources a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background signal, which
nourishes the hope that future GW searches might have a chance to probe the
model. In this paper, we scrutinize GW production during axion inflation in the
gradient expansion formalism (GEF), a powerful numerical technique that
captures the nonlinear dynamics of the system in the limit of vanishing axion
gradients. We focus on axion inflation coupled to a pure Abelian gauge sector,
i.e., pure axion inflation (PAI), and perform the first-ever comprehensive
parameter scan of GW production in the Abelian PAI model close to the onset of
strong backreaction. Remarkably enough, we find that GW signals within the
reach of future GW interferometers can only be realized in parameter regions
that also lead to strong backreaction and that are in conflict with the upper
limit on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, i.e., the allowed energy density of dark
radiation. This observation defines a clear target for future lattice studies
of axion inflation that may confirm or improve the predictions of our GEF
benchmark.

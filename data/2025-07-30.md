### [1] [The NICER view of Scorpius X-1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21219)
*J. López-Miralles,S. E. Motta,J. C. A. Miller-Jones,J. Homan,J. Kajava,S. Migliari*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 本文分析了Sco X-1的中子星X射线双星系统，通过NICER观测数据研究了其在不同吸积状态下的准周期振荡（QPOs）特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Sco X-1的X射线变异性及其与超相对论性喷流的潜在联系。

Method: 使用NICER观测数据，计算光变曲线和硬度-强度图，并通过动态功率密度谱分析X射线时间变异性。

Result: 检测到6 Hz的强QPOs，并在过渡状态中观察到高达15 Hz的快速、较弱的准周期性变异性。

Conclusion: NICER数据支持了Sco X-1中吸积状态与相对论性喷流之间的联系。

Abstract: The Neutron Star X-ray binary Sco X-1 is one of the brightest Z-type sources
in our Galaxy, showing frequent periods of flaring activity and different types
of relativistic outflows. Observations with RXTE have shown that the strongest
X-ray variability appears in the transition from/to the flaring state. During
this transition, it has been proposed that two particular types of
quasi-periodic oscillations might be connected with the ejection of the
so-called ultra-relativistic flows. In this paper, we present an analysis of
the first NICER observations of Sco X-1 obtained during a multi-wavelenght
campaign conducted in February 2019, in order to characterise the properties of
QPOs as the system evolves through its various accretion states. We compute a
light-curve and a Hardness-Intensity diagram to track the evolution of the
source spectral properties, while we investigate the X-ray time variability
with a Dynamical Power Density Spectrum. To trace the temporal evolution of
QPOs, we segment the dataset into shorter, continuous intervals, and compute
and fit the averaged PDS for each interval. Our analysis shows that the overall
behaviour of the source is consistent with the literature; strong QPOs around 6
Hz are detected on the normal branch, while transitions to/from the flaring
branch -- occurring over timescales of a few hundreds of seconds -- are
characterised by rapid, weaker quasi-periodic variability reaching frequencies
up to 15 Hz. Despite limited statistical significance, we also identify faint,
transient timing features above 20 Hz, occasionally coexisting with the
prominent 6 Hz QPOs. Although tentative, the existence of these features in the
NICER data is crucial for interpreting the simultaneous radio observations from
the same multi-wavelength campaign, potentially reinforcing the connection
between the ejection of relativistic outflows and the accretion states in Sco
X-1.

### [2] [The impact of kilonova seed photons on GRB VHE emission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21233)
*John P. Hope,Hendrik J. van Eerten*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文研究了千新星作为种子光子源对伽马射线暴（GRB）余辉中极高能（VHE）发射的影响，发现其可以弥补同步辐射光子的不足，尤其是在短GRB和结构化喷流中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来观测到许多GRB在100 GeV以上甚至1 TeV的VHE发射，但同步辐射光子无法完全解释这些现象，因此需要探索其他种子光子源。

Method: 将千新星建模为热源，注入GRB火球后部，通过壳层模型和动力学求解器更新电子和光子群体。

Result: 研究发现千新星种子光子可以影响短GRB余辉的VHE发射，并在结构化喷流中增强VHE发射，尤其是在离轴观测时。模型应用于GRB 170817A，显示其VHE发射在前100天高于预期。

Conclusion: 千新星作为种子光子源可以补充同步辐射光子的不足，对GRB余辉的VHE发射有显著影响，尤其是在特定条件下。

Abstract: Over the last few years, an increasing number of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) have
been detected with very high energy (VHE) emission in excess of 100 GeV, with a
few cases above 1 TeV. In several instances, synchrotron seed photons do not
fully explain the emission observed, suggesting the presence of other seed
photon sources to up-scatter. In this work, we consider the kilonova as a
source of seed photons for up-scattering in the afterglow. We model the
kilonova as a thermal source injecting into the back of a GRB fireball, evolved
using a shell model, and with the electron and photon populations updated via a
kinetic solver. We find that VHE emission from weaker afterglows, such as those
found in short GRBs, can be affected by such seed photons, with the kilonova
seed photons mitigating the loss of synchrotron photons on the VHE emission
when afterglow parameters are varied. We also find that VHE emission in
structured jets, due to weaker synchrotron emission at their wings, can also
benefit from this supply of seed photons, especially when viewed off-axis. We
apply this model to GRB 170817A, and show that its VHE emission is higher than
expected in previous models for the first 100 days, though still below the
detection threshold.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究利用VLBA和VLA数据分析了低光度活动星系核M84的喷流结构，发现其喷流在低吸积率下较不聚焦。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索低光度活动星系核（LLAGNs）喷流的聚焦特性，填补高功率系统与低功率系统之间的研究空白。

Method: 利用VLBA的相位参考观测和VLA的存档数据，追踪M84喷流从10^2到10^7 rs的几何结构。

Result: M84喷流从半抛物线形（W(r) ∝ r^0.71）过渡到锥形（W(r) ∝ r^1.16），聚焦程度低于其他已知LLAGN。

Conclusion: 研究结果为喷流形成模型提供了新约束，揭示了喷流聚焦与吸积率的关系。

Abstract: Recent advancements in high-resolution Very Long Baseline Interferometry
(VLBI) have significantly improved our understanding of jet collimation near
supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), particularly in
high-power systems. However, the collimation properties of jets in
low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs) remain poorly explored. In this study, we
investigate the jet structure of M84, a nearby radio galaxy and a
representative LLAGN, to probe jet collimation properties in a low-accretion
regime. Utilizing astrometric phase-referencing observations from the Very Long
Baseline Array (VLBA), supplemented by archival Very Large Array (VLA) data, we
trace the jet geometry of M84 over a broad range of scales, from approximately
10^2 to 10^7 Schwarzschild radii (rs). Our analysis reveals a well-defined
transition from a semi-parabolic profile, W(r) proportional to r^0.71, to a
conical shape, W(r) proportional to r^1.16, occurring at approximately 1.67 x
10^4 rs. This indicates that the M84 jet is notably less collimated than those
in other known LLAGN sources. Our findings provide new insights into the
relationship between jet collimation and accretion rate, offering crucial
constraints for jet formation models in LLAGNs.

### [4] [Feasibility of ultra-high-energy cosmic ray backtracking through sparse local measurements of the Galactic magnetic field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21277)
*S. Romanopoulos,M. Mastorakis,V. Pavlidou*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究评估了利用稀疏的银河磁场（GMF）测量数据回溯超高能宇宙射线（UHECR）的可行性，发现稀疏测量在特定条件下仍有效，但高磁场强度区域仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过稀疏的GMF测量数据实现UHECR的精确回溯，以支持带电粒子天文学的发展。

Method: 使用JF12 GMF模型生成模拟稀疏GMF数据和模拟UHECR事件，分析不同稀疏度和磁场强度对回溯精度的影响。

Result: 在平均GMF强度为1μG时，即使测量间距达1600 pc，仍能有效回溯；但磁场强度增加10倍时，400 pc的间距会导致回溯精度崩溃。

Conclusion: 稀疏GMF测量在特定条件下可行，但需结合其他磁场测量和先进重建技术以应对高磁场强度区域的挑战。

Abstract: Planned and ongoing campaigns for the acquisition of high-quality local
measurements of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) at interstellar cloud
locations have generated intense interest in the use of such measurements to
accurately backtrack Ultra High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) through the Milky
Way, a crucial aspect of charged-particle astronomy. However, the inherent
sparsity of these measurements raises concerns regarding the feasibility of
this approach. We assessed the achievable accuracy of UHECR backtracking using
mock sparse local GMF data derived from the Jansson & Farrar 2012 (JF12) GMF
model and mock UHECR events. We created mock UHECR datasets that trace back
within a 3 degree angular range from the galaxy M82 (a hypothesized UHECR
source), and we investigated the impact on such backtracking attempts of
varying GMF measurement sparsity and of varying GMF strength, which we emulated
by rescaling the strength of the ordered components of the JF12 model. We found
that: (a) for an average GMF strength of $1\mu G$, satisfactory backtracking
results for magnetic rigidities of $10^{20}$ eV can be obtained even with very
sparse measurements ($ \sim 1600$ pc); (b) when the average GMF strength is
significantly increased ($\sim$ factor of 10) the accuracy of backtracking
breaks down at measurement spacings of 400 pc. These findings emphasize on one
hand that sparsity is not an automatic deal-breaker for the utility of local
GMF measurements in UHECR backtracking. On the other hand, we also confirm that
important challenges remain on the path from sparse local GMF measurements to
precise charge-particle astronomy, especially in directions of high-strength
ordered magnetic fields. This underscores the importance of using all available
complementary magnetic field measurements and sophisticated reconstruction
techniques to enable accurate backtracking of UHECR.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文研究了SN 2022jli的双峰光变曲线，提出了一种结合磁星和双壳层镍分布的混合模型来解释其独特的光变行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解SN 2022jli的双峰光变曲线、长时间尺度和270天后的光度骤降现象。

Method: 通过流体动力学辐射模拟评估两种模型：双壳层镍分布模型和镍与磁星混合模型。

Result: 最佳拟合模型为磁星（周期22 ms，磁场5×10^14 G）与双壳层镍分布（总质量0.15 M☉）的组合，能重现光变曲线。

Conclusion: 磁星能量注入的快速关闭解释了270天后的光度骤降，混合模型成功解释了SN 2022jli的光变行为。

Abstract: We study the bolometric evolution of the exceptional Type Ic Supernova (SN)
2022jli, aiming to understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for its
distinctive double-peaked light curve morphology, extended timescales, and the
rapid, steep decline in luminosity observed at around 270 days after the SN
discovery. We present a quantitative assessment of two leading models through
hydrodynamic radiative simulations: two shells enriched with nickel and a
combination of nickel and magnetar power. We explore the parameter space of a
model in which the SN is powered by radioactive decay assuming a bimodal nickel
distribution. While this setup can reproduce the early light curve properties,
it faces problems to explain the prominent second peak. We therefore consider a
hybrid scenario with a rapidly rotating magnetar as additional energy source.
We find that the observed light curve morphology can be well reproduced by a
model combining a magnetar engine and a double-layer $^{56}$Ni distribution.
The best-fitting case consist of a magnetar with a spin period of $P\simeq 22$
ms and a bipolar magnetic field strength of $B\simeq 5\times 10^{14}$ G and a
radioactive content with total nickel mass of 0.15 M$_\odot$, distributed
across two distinct shells within a pre-SN structure of 11 M$_\odot$. To
reproduce the abrupt drop in luminosity at $\sim 270$ d, the energy deposition
from the magnetar must be rapidly and effectively switched off.

*Trang N. Huynh,Emmanouil Chatzopoulos,Nageeb Zaman*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: PPISNe是发生在32-65太阳质量氦核恒星中的瞬变事件，由电子-正电子对产生引发压力损失、坍缩和脉动，驱动间歇性质量损失。快速旋转降低质量阈值并影响动力学、能量和化学成分。研究发现质量、能量与速度之间存在强相关性，旋转减少质量抛射和动能。模拟显示快速旋转前身星的壳碰撞可能产生与SLSN-I相似的H贫乏瞬变事件。

Motivation: 研究PPISNe的动力学、能量和化学成分，尤其是快速旋转对其影响，以解释部分超亮超新星和其他罕见瞬变事件。

Method: 计算1D演化模型，模拟85-140太阳质量旋转PPISN前身星，分析质量抛射、能量和速度相关性，并使用SuperLite模拟壳碰撞的光变曲线和光谱。

Result: 发现质量、能量与速度强相关，旋转减少质量抛射和动能。模拟显示快速旋转前身星的H贫乏壳碰撞可产生类似SLSN-I的瞬变事件。

Conclusion: PPISN驱动的间歇性质量损失及其壳碰撞可解释部分超亮超新星，旋转显著影响其动力学和化学成分。

Abstract: Pulsational pair-instability supernovae (PPISNe) are transient events
occurring in progenitor stars with helium cores of approximately 32-65 solar
masses, where rapid electron-positron pair production induces pressure loss,
collapse, and pulsations driving episodic mass loss. The number, strength, and
duration of these pulses can lead to shell collisions that produce
shock-powered transients, potentially explaining some of the most luminous
events, such as superluminous supernovae, and other rare transients. Rapid
progenitor rotation lowers the PPISN mass threshold and influences the
dynamics, energetics, and chemical composition of PPISN-driven pulses. In this
study, we computed 1D evolutionary models of massive, rotating PPISN progenitor
stars with zero-age main-sequence masses of 85-140 solar masses and solar
metallicity and 10% solar metallicity. Our analysis reveals strong correlations
between PPISN ejected mass and total energy as well as between ejected mass and
peak ejected shell velocity. Additionally, moderate correlations indicate that
higher initial PPISN progenitor mass leads to greater mass ejection and energy
release, while negative correlations show that rapid rotation appears to reduce
mass ejection and kinetic energy of the shells. Subsequent pulses lead to
hydrogen-poor, carbon- and oxygen-enriched ejected shells, indicating the
effect of rotationally-induced chemical mixing in PPISN-driven episodic mass
loss with implications for their transients. We model the light curve and
synthetic spectra that arise from the collision of two H-poor shells for one of
our models using the radiation transport code SuperLite. We find that
shock-heated H-poor PPISN shell collisions from rapidly rotating progenitors
can lead to moderately luminous H-poor transients that share some similarities
with observed SLSN-I events.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用X射线观测探测轴子类粒子（ALPs）与光子耦合的方法，评估了XRISM、Athena和Arcus等任务的潜在灵敏度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索标准模型之外的物理，尤其是通过ALPs与光子的耦合效应。

Method: 通过模拟三种代表性系统（背景AGNs、中心AGNs和银河系X射线双星）中的ALPs-光子转换，评估高分辨率X射线任务的灵敏度。

Result: XRISM观测可探测到$g_{a\gamma} \sim 3 \times 10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-1}$，Athena的分辨率使其灵敏度提高约3倍。

Conclusion: 高分辨率X射线观测为探测ALPs提供了新途径，有望揭示标准模型之外的物理现象。

Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) provide a compelling avenue for exploring physics
beyond the Standard Model. In astrophysical magnetized plasmas an ALP-photon
coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ induces energy-dependent oscillations in the photon
survival probability that imprint modulations on emission spectra. X-ray
observations of bright spectrally-smooth sources can provide particularly
sensitive probes of ultralight ALPs with masses $m_a \lesssim 10^{-11}$ eV due
to long propagation distances, strong magnetic fields and high photon
statistics. We present a comprehensive forecast of ALP-photon conversion in
three representative systems: (i) background active galactic nuclei (AGNs)
observed through foreground intracluster magnetic fields, (ii) central AGNs
within their host cluster halos and (iii) Galactic X-ray binaries viewed
through the Milky Way field. Using detailed simulations we assess the
prospective sensitivity of high-resolution X-ray missions including XRISM,
Athena, and Arcus. For typical magnetic field configurations a 5 Ms XRISM
observation of the Perseus Cluster AGN NGC 1275 can reach down to $g_{a\gamma}
\sim 3 \times 10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at $m_a \lesssim 10^{-12}$ eV, while
Athena's superior energy resolution improves this reach by a factor of $\sim
3$. We quantify the impact of magnetic field modeling, photon statistics, and
spectral binning strategies. Our results demonstrate the scientific potential
of high-resolution X-ray observations to probe photon-ALP coupling in
previously inaccessible parameter space, offering a powerful window into
physics beyond the Standard Model.

Motivation: 研究旨在通过物理驱动的随机生成模型，提高黑洞周围时变吸积流及其成像特征的模拟效率与物理真实性。

Method: 扩展Matérn场至时空域，引入局部各向异性张量结构，结合光线追踪方案模拟黑洞阴影和吸积结构。

Result: 模型在保持统计一致性的同时显著提高了计算效率，模拟结果重现了M87*中观测到的亮环结构的动态位置偏移。

Conclusion: 该框架为解释黑洞时变图像提供了理论支持，同时展示了随机生成模型在模拟复杂天体物理现象中的潜力。

Abstract: In this study, we develop a modeling framework based on spatio-temporal
generalized random fields to simulate the time-evolving accretion flows and
their associated imaging signatures around rotating regular black holes. We
extend the Mat\'ern field formalism to the spatio-temporal domain and introduce
a locally anisotropic tensor structure \(\Lambda(\mathbf{x})\), which encodes
direction-dependent correlation scales motivated by Keplerian velocity fields,
thereby generating physically informed perturbation structures. Coupled with a
computationally efficient light ray-tracing scheme, this framework produces a
sequence of time-resolved images of regular black hole shadow and accretion
structures. By incorporating light-travel time effects, we identify significant
temporal smearing of features within strongly lensed regions and rapidly
varying sources, thus enhancing the physical realism of the modeling.
Comparison with existing general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations
demonstrates that our stochastic generative model maintains statistical
consistency while offering substantial computational efficiency. Moreover, the
simulated results reproduce the dynamic positional shift of the bright ring
structure observed in M87$^{*}$, providing theoretical support for interpreting
its time-variable images.

TL;DR: 研究通过建模4FGL耀变体的宽带光谱，探讨了光谱能量分布（SED）和电子能量分布（EED）的演化，发现单区轻子模型能成功拟合GeV-TeV辐射，并揭示了BL Lac和FSRQ的不同行为。

Motivation: 探讨耀变体的SED和EED演化，理解其辐射机制和喷流物理条件。

Method: 使用单区轻子模型和log-parabolic EED拟合宽带光谱，分析SED和EED的关系。

Result: BL Lac符合能均分约束，而FSRQ偏离；发现SED峰值频率与曲率的负相关，支持随机粒子加速。

Conclusion: 耀变体喷流中的磁湍流可能是软的，物理条件接近稳态，BL Lac符合理论关系，FSRQ因热成分影响偏离。

Abstract: We investigate the evolution of spectral energy distribution (SED) and
underlying electron energy distribution (EED) by modeling the nearly
simultaneous broadband spectra of selected bright 4FGL blazars, in the context
of a combined cooling and stochastic acceleration scenario. We find that
one-zone leptonic model with log-parabolic (LP) EED can successfully fit the
GeV-TeV emission of blazars. The synchrotron frequency $\nu_s$ of blazars
mainly evolves due to variation of electron peak energy $\gamma_{3p}$. The BL
Lac objects (BL Lacs) show a negative trend in the $\nu_s- \nu_s L_s$ SED
plane, known as blazar sequence, that does not seem to be an artifact of
Doppler boosting, but driven by the equipartition constraints. A positive
correlation is found between the derived magnetic field $B$ and electron
density $n_e$, whereas $n_e$ and $\gamma_{3p}$ negatively relate, as expected
in an equipartition scenario. The flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) deviate
significantly from such a scenario, indicating their jet parameters should be
varying independently. The synchrotron peak frequency $\nu_s$ and its spectral
curvature $b_s$ negatively correlate for all blazars, confirming the stochastic
particle acceleration in blazar jets. However, blazars do not show the
signature of hard-sphere acceleration, indicating that magnetic turbulence in
the jets might be soft and physical conditions might be near to steady state,
consistent with equipartition. Furthermore, for BL Lacs, the SED curvature
$b_s$ and the EED curvature $r$ and nearly meet the theoretical relationship
$r=5b_s$, whereas the FSRQs show large deviation due to poor constrain on $b_s$
due to presence of thermal component.

Conclusion: 轨道几何变化对γ² Velorum的高能伽马射线光变具有显著影响。

Abstract: Colliding wind binaries (CWBs) are promising sources of high-energy gamma-ray
emission driven by shock acceleration of particles at wind interaction zones.
The nearby CWB system $\gamma^2$ Velorum (WR 11), composed of a Wolf-Rayet (WR)
and an O-star, has been recently associated with GeV gamma-ray emission
observed by Fermi-LAT, including evidence of orbital variability. This offers a
valuable opportunity to test models of phase-dependent hadronic emission and
absorption in CWBs. We aim to explain both the spectral energy distribution
(SED) and orbital variability of gamma-ray emission from $\gamma^2$ Velorum
using a physically motivated phase-dependent hadronic model. We consider the
injection of accelerated relativistic protons based on the WR wind's kinetic
energy intercepted at the wind collision region (WCR), and calculate the
resulting phase-dependent hadronic gamma-ray emission assuming a proton
conversion efficiency $\eta_p$ and accounting for energy-dependent diffusion,
advection, conical shock interception and the evolution of the effective
acceleration volume, assumed to scale with the WCR, with the orbital phase.
Gamma-ray emission from hadronic interactions is attenuated by $\gamma$ -
$\gamma$ absorption, calculated via full angular integration over both stellar
photon fields. Our model successfully reproduces the observed SED and is
consistent with the apastron-to-periastron flux ratio, resulting in a dip in
emission at periastron passage and an increase during apastron. Our findings
support the conclusion that the observed orbital modulation is primarily driven
by geometric variations of the WCR. This underscores the significant influence
of evolving orbital geometry on the high-energy gamma-ray light curves of
$\gamma^2$ Velorum.

Method: 通过分析X射线偏振数据，建立模型模拟单次散射过程，比较轴对称抛物弓激波和抛物圆柱激波两种几何结构。

Conclusion: Cygnus X-3的偏振特性揭示了其独特的圆柱形弓激波几何结构，为研究高能X射线双星系统的风结构提供了新视角。

Abstract: Cygnus X-3 is the only known Galactic high-mass X-ray binary with a
Wolf-Rayet companion. Recent X-ray polarimetry results with the Imaging X-ray
Polarimetry Explorer have revealed it as a concealed ultraluminous X-ray
source. It is also the first source where pronounced orbital variability of
X-ray polarization has been detected -- notably with only one polarization
maximum per orbit. Polarization caused by scattering of the source X-rays can
only be orbitally variable if the scattering angles change throughout the
orbit. Since this requires an asymmetrically distributed medium around the
compact object, the observed variability traces the intrabinary structures. The
single-peaked profile further imposes constraints on the possible geometry of
the surrounding medium. Therefore, the X-ray polarization of Cygnus X-3 is the
first opportunity to study the wind structures of high-mass X-ray binaries in
detail. We aim to uncover the underlying geometry through analytical modeling
of the polarized variability. Knowledge of these structures could be extended
to other sources with similar wind-binary interactions. We study the
variability caused by single scattering in the intrabinary bow shock, exploring
both the optically thin and optically thick limits. We consider two geometries
of the reflecting medium, the axisymmetric parabolic bow shock and the
parabolic cylinder shock, and determine the geometry that best matches the
X-ray polarimetric data. We find that the peculiar properties of the data can
only be replicated with a cylindrical bow shock with asymmetry across the shock
centerline and significant optical depth. This geometry is comparable to shocks
formed by the jet-wind or outflow-wind interactions. The position angle of the
orbital axis is slightly misaligned from the orientation of the radio jet in
all our model fits.

Abstract: Turbulence and magnetic fields are components of the interstellar medium and

transport in the presence of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is an
essential factor for understanding star formation. The theory of Reconnection
Diffusion (RD), based on statistics of Alfv\'enic turbulence, predicts a
dependence of the diffusion coefficient of the magnetic field on the Alfv\'enic
Mach number $M_A$. However, this theory does not consider the effects of
compressibility which are important in the regime of supersonic MHD turbulence.
In this work, we measure the diffusion coefficient of magnetic fields in
sub-Alfv\'enic MHD turbulence, with different sonic Mach numbers $M_S$. We
perform numerical simulations of forced turbulence in periodic domains from the
incompressible limit to the supersonic regime. We introduce two methods to
extract the diffusion coefficient, based on the analysis of tracer particles.
Our results confirm the RD assumption regarding the correspondence between the
diffusion of magnetic field and that of fluid Lagrangian particles. The
measured diffusion rate provided by incompressible turbulence agrees with the
suppression predicted by the RD theory in the presence of strong magnetic
fields: $D \propto M_A^3$. Our simulations also indicate an increase in RD
efficiency when the turbulence is compressible. The dependency on $M_A$ and
$M_S$ from the simulations can be described by the relation $D \propto
M_A^\alpha$, where $\alpha(M_S) \approx 3/(1 + M_S)$. This quantitative
characterization of $D$ is critical for modeling star formation in turbulent
molecular clouds and evaluating the efficiency of this transport compared to
other mechanisms.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了高能电磁过程在中微子生成中的重要作用，为理解极端天体物理现象提供了新视角。

Abstract: High center-of-mass electromagnetic~(EM) interactions could produce decaying
heavy leptons and hadrons, leading to neutrino generation. These processes
might occur in the most extreme astrophysical scenarios, potentially altering
the expected gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes in both the hadronic and the
leptonic pictures. For instance, neutrinos could arise from high-redshift EM
cascades, triggered by gamma rays beyond $10^{18} \; \text{eV}$ scattering
background photons, from radio to ultraviolet energy bands. Such energetic
gamma rays are predicted in cosmogenic models and in scenarios involving
non-standard physics. On astrophysical scales, leptonic production of neutrinos
could take place in active galactic nuclei cores, where several-TeV gamma rays
interact with the X-ray photons from the hot corona. We explore these scenarios
within the CRPropa Monte Carlo code framework, developing dedicated tools to
account for leptonic production and decay of heavy leptons and hadrons. In
particular, the latter are performed by interfacing with the PYTHIA event
generator. With these novel tools, we characterise the spectrum and flavour
composition of neutrinos emerging from cosmological EM cascades and from
leptonic processes in the core of active galactic nuclei. Finally, we
investigate the leptonic production of neutrinos in the context of the IceCube
detection of NGC~1068.

Conclusion: 多次搜索脉冲星数据集具有重要价值。

Abstract: We have reprocessed the data archived from the Parkes 70-cm pulsar (PKS70)
survey with an expanded DM search range and an acceleration search. Our goal
was to detect pulsars that might have been missed in the original survey
processing. Of the original 43842 pointings, 34869 pointings were archived,
along with 440 additional pointings for confirmation or timing. We processed
all of these archived data and detected 359 known pulsars: 265 of these were
detected in the original survey, while an additional 94 currently known pulsars
were detected in our reprocessing. A few among those 94 pulsars are highly
accelerated binary pulsars. Furthermore, we detected 5 more pulsars with DMs
higher than the original survey thresholds, as well as 6 more pulsars below the
nominal survey sensitivity threshold (from the original survey beams with
longer integrations). We missed detection of 33 (of the 298) pulsars detected
in the original survey, in part because portions of the survey data were
missing in the archive and our early stage candidate sifting method. We
discovered one new pulsar in the re-analysis, PSR J0540$-$69 which has a spin
period of 0.909 s and resides in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This new
pulsar appeared in three PKS70 beams and one additional L-band observation that
targeted the LMC pulsar PSR B0540$-$69. The numerous pulsar detections found in
our re-analysis and the discovery of a new pulsar in the LMC highlight the
value of conducting multiple searches through pulsar datasets.

Conclusion: 磁场主导的磁盘中碎片化被抑制，这对AGN吸积流的径向范围和恒星形成效率有重要影响。

Abstract: Accretion disks in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are predicted to become
gravitationally unstable substantially interior to the black hole's sphere of
influence, at radii where the disk is simultaneously unstable to the
magnetorotational instability (MRI). Using local shearing box simulations with
net vertical flux and a simple cooling prescription, we investigate the effect
of magnetic fields on fragmentation in the limit of ideal magnetohydrodyamics.
Different levels of in-disk magnetic field from the magnetorotational
instability are generated by varying the initial vertical-field plasma beta
$\beta_0$. We find that the disk becomes magnetically dominated when $\beta_0 <
10^3$, and that this transition is accompanied by a drastic drop in
fragmentation (as measured by the bound mass fraction) and gravitational
stress. The destabilizing influence of radial magnetic fields, which are
present locally and which may promote fragmentation via magnetic tension
effects, is overwhelmed by magnetic elevation, which significantly reduces the
mid-plane density. The magnetic suppression of fragmentation in magnetically
elevated disks has implications for the radial extent of the accretion flow in
AGN disks, and for the efficiency of in situ formation of disk-embedded stars
that are progenitors for single and binary compact objects.

Conclusion: 研究为SQSs的形成提供了一种可能的途径，并讨论了其天体物理条件和潜在影响。

Abstract: Strange quark stars (SQSs), namely compact stars entirely composed of
deconfined quark matter, are characterized by similar masses and compactness to
neutron stars (NSs) and have been theoretically proposed to exist in the
Universe since the 1970s. However, multiwavelength observations of compact
stars in the last 50 years have not yet led to an unambiguous SQS
identification. This article explores whether SQSs could form in the supernova
(SN) explosion of an evolved star (e.g., carbon-oxygen, or Wolf-Rayet)
occurring in a binary with the companion being a neutron star (NS). The
collapse of the iron core of the evolved star generates a newborn NS and the SN
explosion. Part of the ejected matter accretes onto the NS companion as well as
onto the newborn NS via matter fallback. The accretion occurs at hypercritical
(highly super-Eddington) rates, transferring mass and angular momentum to the
stars. We present numerical simulations of this scenario and demonstrate that
the density increase in the NS interiors during the accretion process may
induce quark matter deconfinement, suggesting the possibility of SQS formation.
We discuss the astrophysical conditions under which such a transformation may
occur and possible consequences.

TL;DR: EDGES探测到的78 MHz吸收信号可能由高红移射电噪活动星系核（AGN）产生，但需要极端物理条件，解释难度大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索EDGES信号的可能来源，特别是高红移射电噪AGN是否能解释信号深度及其与JWST观测到的UV亮天体异常丰度的关联。

Method: 研究高红移射电噪AGN产生足够射电光子以解释EDGES信号深度的条件，并分析其UV光度函数、X射线逃逸率等参数的精细调控需求。

Result: 需要几乎所有高红移UV亮天体为射电噪AGN，且其UV密度在红移10至20间下降不超过1.5个数量级；X射线逃逸率需极低（<1%）。

Conclusion: 射电噪AGN因所需极端条件而难以解释EDGES信号，尽管物理上可能。

Abstract: The Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization 21 cm Signal
(EDGES) has reported evidence for an absorption feature in the sky-averaged
radio background near 78 MHz. A cosmological interpretation of this signal
corresponds to absorption of 21 cm photons by neutral hydrogen at $z \sim 17$.
The large depth of the signal has been shown to require an excess radio
background above the CMB and/or non-standard cooling processes in the IGM.
Here, we explore the plausibility of a scenario in which the EDGES signal is
back-lit by an excess radio background sourced from a population of radio-loud
AGN at high redshift. These AGN could also explain the unexpected abundance of
UV-bright objects observed at $z > 10$ by JWST. We find that producing enough
radio photons to explain the EDGES depth requires that nearly all high-$z$
UV-bright objects down to $M_{\mathrm{UV}} \gtrsim -15$ are radio-loud AGN and
that the UV density of such objects declines by at most 1.5 orders of magnitude
between $z = $10 and 20. In addition, the fraction of X-ray photons escaping
these objects must be $\lesssim 1\%$ of their expected intrinsic production
rate to prevent the absorption signal being washed out by early IGM
pre-heating. Reproducing the sharp boundaries of the absorption trough and its
flat bottom requires that the UV luminosity function, the fraction of UV light
produced by AGN, and the X-ray escape fraction have fine-tuned redshift
dependence. We conclude that radio-loud AGN are an unlikely (although
physically possible) candidate to explain EDGES because of the extreme physical
properties required for them to do so.

Motivation: 解释JWST观测到的高光度星系数量和质量与标准LCDM宇宙学模型预测不符的现象。

Method: 使用Pegase恒星群体代码分析三种效应：IMF偏重、恒星形成历史和初始金属丰度，计算修正的恒星形成效率。

Result: 发现这些效应可能导致星系质量被高估，例如IMF斜率变化可使恒星形成效率降低约10倍。

Conclusion: 这些效应可能解释JWST观测到的星系质量和高数量现象，无需挑战标准宇宙学模型。

Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope has discovered high luminosity galaxies that
appear to be "too many" and "too massive" compared to predictions of the
Standard LCDM cosmology, suggesting that star formation in the early universe
is more rapid than previously anticipated. In this paper we examine in detail
the following three effects which can instead provide alternative explanations
for these observations: (1) a "top heavy" initial mass function (IMF) for the
stars, (2) a variety of star formation histories (constant, exponentially
decreasing, and peaked star formation rates), and (3) a variety of initial
metallicities. Due to any of these three effects, galaxies of a given
luminosity in JWST may be interpreted as having a larger stellar mass than they
actually do. Our results are obtained using the Pegase stellar population code,
and are presented as the ratio of the modified star formation efficiency
relative to the fiducial one (which uses a Salpeter IMF and constant star
formation rate). As an example, if the high-mass end of the IMF goes as
$M^{-1.35}$, the star formation efficiency and inferred stellar galactic mass
could be lower by a factor of $\sim 10$ than in the fiducial case. Our
examination (keeping the star formation rate constant) of a top-heavy IMF with
slope $\alpha$ leads to a simple relation that is a good approximation to the
numerical results, $\epsilon(\alpha) \approx \epsilon_{\rm fid}e^{2.66(\alpha
-2.35)}$. Since there are more low mass galaxies than high mass galaxies, these
effects may result in a large number of seemingly overly massive galaxies
compared to the expectations. Thus, the effects studied in this paper may
explain both puzzling observations regarding high luminosity galaxies in JWST:
the apparently overly massive galaxies as well as the profusion of apparently
high mass galaxies.

signal-to-noise greater than 4 at a 2.4 arcminute filter scale. The catalog
includes 1166 clusters at redshifts greater than 1, and 121 clusters at
redshifts greater than 1.5. Using a relation between cluster SZ signal and mass
that is consistent with recent weak-lensing measurements, we estimate that
clusters detected with signal-to-noise greater than 5 form a sample which is
90% complete for clusters with masses greater than $5 \times 10^{14}$ MSun
(measured within a spherical volume with mean density 500 times the critical

degrees, remains the most extreme cluster in mass and redshift; we find no
cluster with a mass and redshift combination high enough to falsify the
standard LCDM cosmology with Gaussian initial perturbations. We make public a

Motivation: 探讨DESI DR2数据与Planck ΛCDM宇宙学的差异，分析Ωm值的异常及其随红移的变化趋势。

Method: 利用DESI DR2数据，特别是LRG1数据，分析Ωm值和w0waCDM模型参数，并与Planck ΛCDM及超新星数据对比。

Result: 发现Ωm值异常高（0.471），w0>1，且Ωm随红移增加波动，但统计显著性降低。

Conclusion: DESI DR2数据与Planck ΛCDM存在差异，未来数据可能减少矛盾，但需进一步研究LRG1数据的异常。

Abstract: Although the debate about the systematic errors of DESI DR1 is still open,
recent DESI DR2 is consistent with DESI DR1 and further strengthens the results
of DESI DR1. In this analysis, we present a $\sim 2.38 \sigma$ discrepancy
between Planck $\Lambda$ CDM cosmology and the DESI DR2 Luminous Red Galaxy
(LRG1) data at $z_{\text{eff}} = 0.51$, which predicts an unexpectedly large
value for $\Omega_m$, $\Omega_m = 0.471^{+0.119}_{-0.065}$. We find that the
$w_0 w_a$CDM model, using DESI DR2 data, suggests $w_0 > 1$, indicating a
deviation from the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, where is strictly $w_0 =
-1$. Additionally, the DESI DR2 data reveals that the value of $\Omega_m$
fluctuates at the 2.97 $\sigma$ level as redshift bin increases, particularly
within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The DESI DR2 LRG1 data at $z_{\text{eff}} =
0.51$ seem to contradict the results from Type Ia supernovae in the same
redshift range. However, it is expected that this discrepancy will become less
significant with future DESI data releases, and the trend for $\Omega_m$ is
expected to continue to increase as higher redshifts are considered. The
statistical significance of this trend was approximately $1.8 \sigma$ when only
the DESI DR1 data was considered, but, in the light of DESI DR2 data, the
significance has decreased to about $0.52 \sigma$. Despite this reduction, the
trend showing an increase in $\Omega_m$ with higher redshifts remains, though
with less statistical confidence. This highlights the importance of
understanding why the DESI LRG1 data at $z_{\text{eff}} = 0.51$ appear to be an
outlier in the determination of $\Omega_m$.

Conclusion: 缺失重子可能与高温WHIM及星系大尺度纤维结构相关，与数值模拟和其他独立探测结果一致。

Abstract: This paper presents constraints on the cosmological density of baryons from a
systematic search for O VII and O VIII absorption lines in the XMM-Newton and
Chandra X-ray spectra of 51 background sources. The search is based on far
ultra-violet redshift priors from HST and FUSE, and it has resulted in the
identification of 34 possible O VII and O VIII absorption-line systems at the
99% confidence level, out of a search in 1,224 systems with fixed redshift
priors. Of these, 7 O VII and 8 O VIII systems pass additional screening
criteria and are deemed to be associated with the warm-hot intergalactic medium
(WHIM). We find that the cosmological baryon density associated with these
possible detections is consistent with the value required to solve the missing
baryons problem. Specifically, we find that $\Omega_{WHIM,X} /\Omega_b =
0.83\pm^{3.99}_{0.62}$ from the O VII lines, at the 68% level of confidence
(assuming 20% Solar abundances and 100% ionization fraction), or separately
$\Omega_{WHIM,X} /\Omega_b = 0.79\pm^{3.08}_{0.50}$ from the O VIII lines
(assuming 20% Solar abundances 50% ionization fraction). We also conducted an
extensive analysis of systematic errors affecting these estimates, and provided
evidence of the association between the detected X-ray absorption line systems
with known filaments of SDSS galaxies. The results of this analysis therefore
contributes to the characterization of the missing baryons and it indicates
that they are in fact associated with the high-temperature portion of the
warm-hot intergalactic medium, and possibly with large-scale WHIM filaments
traced by galaxies, as consistently predicted by numerical simulations and by
other independent probes.

the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields. We present the first measurement of the
Ly$\alpha$ forest auto-correlation function derived exclusively from LBG
spectra, probing comoving separations up to 48 $h^{-1}$Mpc at an effective
redshift of $z_\mathrm{eff}$ = 2.70. The measured signal is consistent with
that from DESI DR2 quasar Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra at a comparable redshift,
validating LBGs as reliable background sources. We also measure the
cross-correlation between the LBG Ly$\alpha$ forest and 13,362 galaxy
positions, showing that this observable serves as a sensitive diagnostic for
galaxy redshift uncertainties and systematic offsets. Finally, using synthetic
LBG spectra and Fisher forecasts, we show that a future wide-area survey over
5000 deg$^2$, targeting 1000 LBGs per deg$^2$ at similar signal-to-noise than
our dataset, could enable Ly$\alpha$ forest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)
measurements with 0.4% precision on the isotropic BAO scale and 1.3% on the
anisotropic (Alcock-Paczynski) scale. Combining BAO with a Ly$\alpha$ forest
full-shape analysis improves the AP constraint to 0.6%. These results open a
new path for precision cosmology at high redshift using dense LBG samples.

Motivation: 研究目的是比较两种方法（AE-CNN和MLE）在推断星系团质量时的性能差异，尤其是直接从未标记的星系分布中推断质量的能力。

Method: AE-CNN通过模拟星系目录训练，而MLE假设相似质量的星系团具有相同的相空间星系分布。AE-CNN近似后验均值，而MLE在固定真实质量时返回无偏估计。

Result: AE-CNN在预测星系团质量时的均方根误差为0.10 dex，优于MLE的0.16 dex。即使存在强不均匀Malmquist偏差，AE-CNN仍表现稳定。

Conclusion: AE-CNN在直接推断星系团质量方面优于传统MLE方法，尤其是在处理复杂数据时表现更稳健。

Abstract: We compare an autoencoder convolutional neural network (AE-CNN) with a
conventional maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) for inferring cluster virial
masses, $M_v$, directly from the galaxy distribution around clusters, without
identifying members or interlopers. The AE-CNN is trained on mock galaxy
catalogues, whereas the MLE assumes that clusters of similar mass share the
same phase-space galaxy profile. Conceptually, the MLE returns an unbiased
estimate of $\log M_v$ at fixed true mass, whereas the AE-CNN approximates the
posterior mean, so the true $\log M_v$ is unbiased at fixed estimate. Using
MDPL2 mock clusters with redshift space number density as input, the AE-CNN
attains an rms scatter of $0.10\,\textrm{dex}$ between predicted and true $\log
M_v$, compared with $0.16\,\textrm{dex}$ for the MLE. With inputs based on mean
peculiar velocities, binned in redshift space or observed distance, the AE-CNN
achieves scatters of $0.12\,\textrm{dex}$ and $0.16\,\textrm{dex}$,
respectively, despite strong inhomogeneous Malmquist bias.

Abstract: The nature of dark matter remains one of the most pressing open questions in
modern cosmology. Despite extensive experimental efforts, no direct or indirect
detection of dark matter particles has been confirmed. This has motivated
alternative approaches, including modifications to the underlying theory of
gravity. In this work, we investigate the implications of a specific non-local
gravity (NLG) theory, which modifies General Relativity by introducing
non-local effects that manifest as an effective dark matter component. We
analyze the velocity dispersion profiles of eight classical dwarf spheroidal
(dSph) galaxies - Carina, Draco, Fornax, Leo I, Leo II, Sculptor, Sextans, and
Ursa Minor - to test the predictions of NLG. Using the Jeans equation, we model
the kinematics of these galaxies and perform a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte
Carlo analysis to constrain the parameters of the NLG kernel chosen for our
analysis. Our results indicate that NLG might successfully reproduce the
observed kinematics of dSph galaxies without requiring particle dark matter,
providing constraints on the scale-dependent modifications to gravity that are
compatible with previous studies in the literature. However, a parameter
inconsistency remains in the cases of Fornax and Sextans galaxies that requires
further attention.

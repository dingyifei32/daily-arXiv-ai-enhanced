In particular, flux-ratio anomalies in quadruply imaged quasars\n(\"quads\") can reveal the presence of dark substructure, such that\npopulation-level statistics can be used to constrain the particle nature of DM.\nCurrent methods, however, rely on globally parametrized models (\"macromodels\")\nof the lens mass distribution, which impose rigid physical assumptions on the\ndeflection field. Given the high stakes, it is important to develop\ncomplementary methods that do not require the assumption of a macromodel. One\npromising avenue consists of modeling the resolved emission from the quasar\nhost galaxy (lensed arcs) using a local lensing formalism like the Curved Arc\nBasis (CAB) description. In this paper, we test the ability of CAB models to\npredict flux ratios from mock imaging data. We find that CAB model-predicted\nflux ratios accurately reproduce the expected values, with a typical precision\nof $\\sim 3-5\\%$. While a macromodel-based approach yields smaller\nuncertainties, as expected, the CAB method permits a more flexible, local\ndescription of the deflection field, thus being more robust to angular\nstructure in the main deflector mass profile, in particular avoiding\nfalse-positive detections of flux-ratio anomalies that can arise with overly\nsimplistic parametrizations. On the other hand, by injecting individual DM\nhalos near quasar images, we demonstrate that CAB models do not absorb the\nlocal lensing perturbations from DM substructure, and can therefore distinguish\nflux-ratio anomalies caused by DM substructure from other sources of\nsmall-scale perturbation. We conclude that CAB models can be used to infer DM\nproperties from flux-ratio anomaly statistics with minimal assumptions,\ncomplementing the traditional macromodel based approach."}

Dense star clusters provide natural\nenvironments for forming such systems, beyond the limits of standard massive\nstar evolution to core collapse. While repeated BBH mergers can grow BHs\nthrough dynamical interactions (the so-called \"hierarchical merger\" channel),\nmost star clusters with masses $\\lesssim 10^6\\,M_\\odot$ have escape speeds too\nlow to retain higher-generation BHs, limiting growth into or beyond the mass\ngap. In contrast, BH--star collisions with subsequent accretion of the\ncollision debris can grow and retain BHs irrespective of the cluster escape\nspeed. Using $N$-body (Cluster Monte Carlo) simulations, we study BH growth and\nspin evolution through this process and we find that accretion can drive BH\nmasses up to at least $\\sim200\\,M_\\odot$, with spins set by the details of the\ngrowth history.

However, the\ntwo pathways predict distinct signatures: hierarchical mergers yield more\nunequal mass ratios, whereas accretion-grown BHs preferentially form\nnear-equal-mass binaries. The accretion-driven channel allows dense clusters\nwith low escape speeds, such as globular clusters, to produce highly spinning\nBBHs with both components in or above the mass gap, providing a natural\nformation pathway to GW231123-like systems."}

Here we report the discovery of a set of\ndistinctive properties that rule the temporal and spectral evolution of GRB\n230307A, a LGRB with evidence for a COM origin.

Using the stellar and binary evolution code MESA, which includes a\nrecently proposed helium-star wind prescription alongside internal differential\nrotation and tidal interactions,we find that the recently proposed wind\nprescription for helium stars is substantially weaker than the standard Dutch\nwind scheme, particularly at subsolar metallicity. Using this scheme, we\nperform detailed binary modeling of a helium star with a black hole companion.\nOur results show that the spin magnitude of the resulting black hole is\ninsensitive to the helium star's evolutionary stage at the onset of tidal\ninteractions or to the companion mass. Instead, wind mass loss plays the\ndominant role: more massive helium-star progenitors produce lower-spinning\nblack holes. The initial stellar rotation has only a minor effect, especially\nunder strong tidal coupling, consistent with the common assumption of orbital\nsynchronization. Using the derived relation between the mass and spin of the\nsecond-born black hole, we find that the properties of most binary black holes\nin GWTC-4.0-specifically the mass ratio q and effective inspiral spin\nchi_eff-can be reproduced.

To\nprogress along these lines, we report on particle-in-cell simulations of\nparticle acceleration in relativistic, magnetized turbulent pair plasmas\nincluding synchrotron radiative losses. Our key finding is that the particle\nenergy spectrum does not terminate at this maximal energy but extends beyond\nwith a steepened spectrum, up to the synchrotron burn-off limit where particles\ncool within a gyrotime. For our adopted parameters (magnetization $\\sigma\n\\approx 1 $ and amplitude $\\delta B/B_0\\simeq 1$), the particle distribution\nfollows ${\\rm d}n/{\\rm d}\\gamma\\propto \\gamma^{-s}$ with $s\\simeq 3$ below the\npredicted maximal energy, then steepens to $s\\simeq 4$ above. The particle\ndistribution and the radiated synchrotron spectra display strong variability\nnear the cutoff energy down to timescales well below the largest eddy\nturn-around time. We substantiate our results by demonstrating that the\nacceleration rate itself displays a broken powerlaw-like distribution whose\nmaximal value is the gyrofrequency. The highest energy particles are\naccelerated by a generalized Fermi process in ideal electric fields, driven by\na gradient of the $4$--velocity field $u_E$ of the magnetic field lines of\nrelativistic amplitude, $\\delta u_E \\gtrsim c$, ordered on a scale comparable\nto the particle gyroradius. We contend that this is a generic feature of\nrelativistic, large-amplitude turbulence.

The properties of these outflows change dramatically\nbetween different spectral/accretion states.

In this context,\nfinding a unique link between the jet evolution and the properties of the X-ray\nemission, such as its fast variability, would imply a major progress in our\nunderstanding of the fundamental mechanisms that drive relativistic outflows in\nBH XRBs.

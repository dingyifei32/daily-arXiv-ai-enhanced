In this study, our objective is to\ninvestigate the empirical chi_eff distribution (and constrain individual spin\ncomponents) of binary BH mergers and compare them with extensive simulations,\nassuming that they originate purely from isolated binaries or a mixture of\nformation channels. We explore scenarios using BH kicks with and without the\neffect of spin-axis tossing during BH formation. We employ simple yet robust\nMonte Carlo simulations of the final core collapse forming the second-born BH,\nusing minimal assumptions to ensure transparency and reproducibility. The\nsynthetic chi_eff distribution is compared to the empirical data from LVK\nscience runs O1-O3 using functional data analysis, kernel density estimations,\nand three different statistical tests, accounting for data uncertainties. We\nfind strong indications for spin-axis tossing during BH formation if LVK\nsources are dominated by the isolated binary channel.

A statistically acceptable\nsolution without tossing, however, emerges if ~72+/-8% of detected binary BH\nmergers result from dynamical interactions causing random BH spin directions.\nFinally, for an isolated binary origin, we find a preference for mass reversal\nin ~30% of the progenitor binaries.

These oscillations are the most susceptible to the\nChandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz (CFS) instability driven by gravitational wave\nemission, which makes them promising targets for current and future\ngravitational wave searches. In order to develop, the instability must overcome\ndissipative processes within the star. As a result, $r$-modes become unstable\nonly for certain combinations of stellar angular velocity $\\Omega$ and\n(redshifted) temperature $T^\\infty$, defining the so-called instability window\non the $(\\Omega, T^\\infty)$ plane. At high temperatures, bulk viscosity\n$\\zeta$, arising from out-of-equilibrium chemical reactions, is the dominant\ndissipative agent. Dissipation due to $\\zeta$ can be greatly enhanced by two\nindependent mechanisms: (1) the presence of hyperons, which significantly\nincreases the bulk viscosity, and (2) the distinctive properties of\nrelativistic $r$-modes in nonbarotropic matter, which further amplify\ndissipation beyond Newtonian predictions. In this work, we present the first\ninvestigation of the combined impact of these mechanisms on $r$-mode\ninstability windows. Our calculations also account for the fact that chemical\nreactions modify the adiabatic index, in addition to producing bulk viscosity.\nWe further estimate the influence of nucleon pairing effects on the instability\nwindows. By comparing our predictions with recent observations of neutron stars\nin low-mass X-ray binaries, we find that bulk viscosity in hyperonic matter may\nprovide the necessary dissipation to stabilize $r$-modes in the\nfastest-spinning and moderately hot stars, even when nucleon superfluidity and\nsuperconductivity are taken into account. These results have important\nimplications for the interpretation of observations and for the broader\nunderstanding of relativistic $r$-mode physics."}

We analyze how the\ngravitational mass, equatorial radius, shape deformation, magnetic flux, and\nthe magnetic-to-binding energy ratio evolve in response to changes in internal\ncomposition, thermodynamic conditions, and magnetic field configuration. Our\nresults show that as PNSs evolve, increasing entropy per baryon and decreasing\nlepton fractions lead to higher core temperatures. These thermodynamic changes\nenhance the star's susceptibility to magnetic field-induced deformation,\nfacilitate greater magnetic flux confinement, and increase the\nmagnetic-to-binding energy ratio, especially during the deleptonization and\nneutrino-transparent phases. The PNS's core temperature also determines the\nefficiency of magnetic field decay.

We evaluate the fluctuation\nmoments for the number of particles and the correlated fluctuations for number\nand energy of particles, clustering under their mutual gravitation. The\ncorrelated fluctuations $<\\Delta N\\Delta U>$ show that the value of $<\\Delta\nN>$ can be both positive as well as negative, because it is the difference\nbetween $N$ and the mean value of $N$. A negative $<\\Delta N>$ corresponds to\nregions of under density and positive $<\\Delta N>$ corresponds to regions of\nover density, as described by the clustering parameter $b$. The present work is\nconcerned in the region $b\\ge 0$, at which gravitational interaction has\nalready started causing the galaxies to cluster. Thus for this work the value\nof $<\\Delta N>$ is positive. Similarly, the energy fluctuations $<\\Delta U>$\ncan also be both positive and negative. For large correlations, the overdense\nregions typically have negative total energy and underdense regions have\nusually positive total energy. The critical value at which this switch occurs\nhas been calculated analytically. The results obtained by fluctuation theory\nclosely match with those obtained earlier by Specific heat analysis and Lee\nYang theory. The evaluation has been extended to multicomponent systems, having\na variety of masses. It has been found that the gravitational clustering of\ngalaxies is more sensitive to mass ratios and less sensitive to galaxies number\ndensities. This means there is little effect of $\\nu$ (number density) but\nsignificant effect of $\\mu$ (mass) on the clustering phenomenon. The clustering\nof galaxies is quicker when mass of individual galaxies increases. As the mass\nof galaxies increases, the transition from positive to negative energy occurs\nat a higher stage of clustering as compared to a single component system."}

The GSM proposes a $\\sim$4 %\nincrease in the effective gravitational constant $G_{\\text{eff}}$ beyond $z\n\\approx 0.01$ to reconcile local and early-universe measurements of the Hubble\nconstant. Through detailed quantitative analysis, we demonstrate that many\nproposed constraints on the model require careful reconsideration. Key findings\ninclude: (1) Modern stellar modeling indicates a weaker $L \\propto G^4$ scaling\nrather than the traditional $G^7$, significantly reducing tension with stellar\nevolution constraints; (2) The fluid-like behavior of Earth 150 Myr ago\npreserves the day/year ratio across any $G$ transition; (3) Paleoclimate data\nshowing $\\sim$20{\\deg}C cooling over relevant timescales appears consistent\nwith, rather than challenging, the GSM; (4) Distance indicator comparisons\nallow for $\\Delta G/G$ variations up to $\\sim$20 % at 2$\\sigma$ when systematic\nuncertainties are properly included; (5) The discrete nature of the proposed\n$G$ transition preserves relative stellar population ages used in cosmic\nchronometry. When accounting for proper uncertainty levels in both observations\nand theoretical modeling, we find the GSM remains a viable candidate for\nresolving the Hubble tension. We identify specific observational tests with\nnext-generation facilities that could definitively confirm or rule out the\nmodel."}

It is\nprimarily sourced by the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect -- the up-scattering\nof CMB photons on free electrons in collapsed dark matter halos. In this work\nand our companion paper, Ref. [1], we perform a re-analysis of the archival\nCOBE/FIRAS data to constrain $\\langle y \\rangle$. We utilize two analysis\napproaches: (i) fitting the sky-averaged intensity spectrum (frequency\nmonopole) and (ii) fitting the sky spectrum in each pixel (pixel-by-pixel). We\nobtain the baseline upper limits $\\langle y \\rangle < 31\\times 10^{-6}$ and\n$\\langle y \\rangle < 8.3\\times 10^{-6}$ (both at $95\\%$ C.L.) for these two\napproaches, respectively.

Our findings suggest that\naccounting for the spatial variability of foregrounds via pixel-by-pixel\nfitting allows for tighter constraints on $\\langle y \\rangle$ by a factor of\n$\\approx 3-5$ as compared to the frequency monopole method. We show that our\nfrequency monopole results agree well with predictions from Fisher forecast\ntechniques based on the sky-averaged signal, which have been used for\nforecasting future spectral distortion experiments. Our results thus suggest\nthat the scientific reach of future spectral distortion experiments can\npotentially be enhanced by a factor of a few via more optimal component\nseparation methods, and we identify the pixel-by-pixel method as one such\nrobust way to achieve this. We discuss the implications of our improved\nconstraints on $\\langle y \\rangle$ from the pixel-by-pixel method in Ref. [1]."}

A central challenge is to determine whether these deviations reflect genuine dynamical dark energy behavior or instead arise from cross-probe inconsistencies, prior choices, or mismatches in likelihood construction. Previous work demonstrated that imposing a biased supernova-motivated prior on Omega_{m0} can artificially displace the BAO-inferred w_0,w_a values from the LambdaCDM expectation. A complementary pedagogic study further showed that the differing degeneracy geometries of BAO, CMB, and SNe can generate apparent dark energy evolution even when the underlying cosmology is exactly LambdaCDM. In this manuscript, we develop a controlled tension injection framework that provides a systematic means of quantifying how probe-level tensions influence inferred dark energy parameters. Self-consistent BAO, CMB, and SNe mock datasets are augmented with parameterized shifts in (Omega_{m0}, H_0), supernova absolute calibration, and the BAO sound-horizon scale $r_d$. The resulting datasets are analyzed through a unified MCMC pipeline, enabling a direct assessment of how these controlled tensions propagate into biases in (w_0, w_a) and the pivot equation-of-state parameter w_p. This forecasting framework provides practical guidance for identifying probe combinations that are most susceptible to spurious signatures of dynamical dark energy, and helps ensure robust multi-probe inference in forthcoming precision surveys."}

Companion paper to arXiv:2504.13251", "summary": "How is the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) in single-field models of inflation impacted by the presence of additional scalar fields? We consider the effect of a spectator field - a free scalar field with sub-Hubble mass, no direct coupling to the inflaton, and which makes a subdominant contribution to the total energy density - in the context of single-field models of inflation featuring a transient phase of ultra-slow roll (USR) evolution. Despite the modest title, a spectator field can have a dramatic impact: the slow-roll evolution of the spectator prevents the combined inflaton-and-spectator system from entering into USR, which naively might be expected to preclude the production of PBHs. However, we demonstrate that the growth of perturbations is maintained or enhanced by the spectator, through the rich interplay of curvature and isocurvature perturbations. We show in a model-independent way that the single-field phase of ultra-slow-roll is replaced by two turns in field space encompassing a phase of tachyonic instability for the isocurvature perturbations and a transfer of power from isocurvature to curvature modes. Furthermore, we highlight a degeneracy between the fine-tuning of the feature in the inflaton potential and the parameters of the spectator, leading to an overall resilience of model predictions to parameter variations. This makes it easier for the underlying PBH model to accommodate both high-precision CMB constraints and production of PBHs in the asteroid-mass range."}

Recent cosmological simulations such as FLAMINGO calibrate their feedback model on the baryon fractions of galaxy groups to tune the efficiency of gas ejection. However, recent observational constraints from optically selected groups and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect yield lower baryon fractions than previous studies, which indicates that feedback may be more ejective than previously thought. Here we show that models involving highly ejective feedback are inconsistent with the scaling relations of local galaxy groups in the mass range $10^{13}-10^{14}M_\\odot$. We study the X-ray luminosity-temperature relation in a sample of 44 galaxy groups with high-quality XMM-Newton observations. We show that highly ejective models under-predict the luminosity of galaxy groups at fixed mass at high significance ($5.7σ$). This conclusion is robust against selection effects and is obtained from directly measurable and minimally correlated quantities. We point out that turning observable quantities into gas fraction estimates is challenging, especially in the context of stacking large samples of heterogeneous systems. We argue that calibrating feedback models on baryon fractions is prone to systematic uncertainties and that observable scaling relations are better suited for this task."}

This dispersion is believed to be a combination of beaming effects, different geometries, and case-by-case variability of the emission mechanism efficiency, but it is not clear in what proportion. In this work we focused on the gamma-ray range and analysed the four main ingredients that likely contribute to this dispersion: the geometrical term arising from the anisotropic emission (beaming), viewing and inclination angles, the uncertainty on the pulsar distance, the uncertainty on the moment of inertia, and the intrinsic efficiency of the mechanism producing the gamma-ray emission. Estimating the expected ranges of the moment of inertia and the distance errors, and considering a geometrical and spectral model that we have recently used to fit the light curves and spectra of the entire gamma-ray pulsar population, we estimate the a priori distribution of the first three ingredients in order to obtain the a posteriori distribution of the intrinsic efficiency of the mechanism. We found the latter to peak at $\\sim 5-15 \\%$ and to have a dispersion of around one order of magnitude. That is, we found the intrinsic efficiency of the mechanism to be the leading factor in the observed dispersion. In addition, we found little sensitivity of these results on different distributions of the estimated pulsar distance errors, and saw that the weak, alleged correlation with the spin-down power can only explain part of the observed dispersion. This methodology can be easily applied to other geometrical models of the emission, to test the sensitivity of these results on the beaming distribution."}

We permit the photon direction to be continuous (as opposed to constraining the analysis to discrete ordinates). The result is a drift-diffusion equation in the lab frame for comoving radiation energy density, with an adiabatic term that matches the standard semi-relativistic diffusion equation.

The simplest types of PNG are the local and non-local (equilateral and orthogonal) shapes of the primordial three-point correlators, which are predicted by models with multiple light fields and derivative interactions in single-field inflation, respectively. In this paper we place constraints on local, equilateral, and orthogonal non-Gaussianities using the power spectrum and bispectrum extracted from first public release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our analysis makes use of higher-order clustering information through a consistent effective field theory (EFT) model for both the power spectrum and bispectrum at one-loop order. Using robust scale cuts where the EFT description is valid, we find the following constraints on PNG amplitudes: $f^{\\rm loc}_{\\rm NL}=-0.1\\pm 7.4$, $f^{\\rm equil}_{\\rm NL}=719\\pm 390$, $f^{\\rm orth}_{\\rm NL}=-200\\pm 100$ (at $68\\%$ CL).

Due to a solar array drive assembly malfunction starting in March 2018, only small number (15) of SGRE events were observed during SC 25. Over the first 61 months, the average sunspot number (SSN) increased from 56.9 in SC 24 to 79.0 in SC 25. Fast and wide (FW) CMEs and decameter-hectometric (DH) type II bursts also increased significantly in SC 25 by 29% and 33%, respectively when normalized to SSN. Therefore, the increase in solar activity should result in a higher number of SGREs in SC 25. We estimated the number of SGREs in SC 25 using three methods. (i) If the SGRE number varies commensurate FW CMEs and DH type II bursts, SC 25 should have 45-47 SGRE events. (ii) In SC 24, ~17% of FW CMEs and 25% of DH type II bursts were associated with SGRE events. At this rate, SC 25 should have 46 SGRE events. (iii) Since SGRE events are invariably associated with >100 keV hard X-ray (HXR) bursts, we identified DH type II bursts associated with >100 keV HXR bursts from Fermi gamma ray burst monitor (GBM) during LAT data gaps. Based on our finding that SGRE events in SCs 24 and 25 were all associated with HXR bursts of duration > ~5 min, we found only 27 of the 79 LAT-gap type II bursts had >100 keV HXR bursts with duration > ~5 min. These DH type II bursts are likely to indicate SGRE, bringing the total number of SGRE events to 42 (15 observed + 27 inferred). Thus, the three methods provide similar estimates of the number of SGRE events in SC 25. We, therefore, conclude that that SC 25 is stronger than SC 24 based on the estimated number SGRE events. Halo CMEs, ground level enhancement (GLE) events, and intense geomagnetic storms are also consistent with a stronger SC 25."}

If ultra-light RPBHs dominated the early Universe, the initial isocurvature perturbation is converted into curvature perturbation that induce second-order GW background upon evaporation of RPBHs. The upper limit of extra relativistic degrees of freedom $ΔN_{\\rm eff}$, which could be inferred from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis or Cosmic Microwave Background observations, places a constraint on the maximum energy density of GW, which in turn can be used to constrain the RPBH population. As RPBHs have different lifetime from their singular counterparts, the constraint must be modified accordingly. While the formalism that we provide is generic, we work out explicitly the case of Simpson-Visser metric for demonstration. The RPBHs associated with this metric have lower Hawking temperature and smaller horizon size, leading to a longer lifetime than the singular Schwarzschild black holes. This implies a stronger constraint on RPBH population as they dominate the Universe for a longer period of time and generate stronger GW."}

Numerical simulations reveal that this unbound ejecta should be strongly polar-dominated, which may cause the following radioactive-powered thermal transient to be viewing-angle-dependent. This issue has so far received limited investigation.\n  We investigate how the intrinsically non-spherical geometry of WD-NS wind ejecta affects the viewing-angle dependence of the thermal transients. Using a two-dimensional axisymmetric ejecta configuration and incorporating heating from the radioactive decay of $^{56}\\mathrm{Ni}$, we employ a semi-analytical discretization scheme to simulate the observed viewing-angle-dependent photospheric evolution, as well as the resulting spectra and lightcurves. The observed photosphere evolves over time and depends strongly on the viewing angle: off-axis observers can see deeper, hotter inner layers of the ejecta and larger projected photospheric areas compared to on-axis observers. For a fiducial WD-NS merger producing 0.3 solar mass of ejecta and 0.01 solar mass of synthesized $^{56}\\mathrm{Ni}$, the resulting peak optical absolute magnitudes of the transient span from ~ -12 mag along the polar direction to ~ -16 mag along the equatorial direction, corresponding to luminosities of $10^{40}$-$10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The typical peak timescales are expected to be 3-10 d. We for the first time explore the viewing-angle effect on WD-NS merger transients. Since their ejecta composition and energy sources resemble those of supernovae, yet WD-NS merger transients are dimmer and evolve more rapidly, we propose using \"mini-supernovae\" to describe the thermal emission following WD-NS mergers."}

From detailed numerical simulations we find that the bubbles are generically surrounded by type-II curvature fluctuations. Special attention is given to the distribution of initial conditions, including the relevant mean profiles and shape dispersion around them. For the adiabatic channel, we extend the logarithmic template formula $ζ[ζ_G]$, which maps the Gaussian curvature perturbation to the fully non-Gaussian one while incorporating mode evolution, and we compare this with numerical results obtained using the $δN$ formalism. While the template departs from numerical results near its logarithmic divergence, it still provides accurate threshold values for PBH formation in the parameter range relevant to our analysis.

While the abundances of these elements in Milky Way stars are close to solar values, supernova explosion models systematically underestimate their production by up to an order of magnitude, indicating that key mechanisms for odd-Z nucleosynthesis are currently missing from theoretical models. Here we report the observation of P, Cl, and K in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A using high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with XRISM, with the detection of K at above the 6$σ$ level being the most significant finding. Supernova explosion models of normal massive stars cannot explain the element abundance pattern, especially the high abundances of Cl and K, while models that include stellar rotation, binary interactions or shell mergers agree closely with the observations.

In PTA data sets with sufficiently long observational time span, this means that the Earth and pulsar terms' contributions to the CGW signal signature can eventually become resolvable. Since the pulsar term is accumulated incoherently and thus often treated as an additional source of noise, this separation can prove to be beneficial for the detection of the CGW signal in the PTA data set. We aim to investigate to what extent resolvable Earth and pulsar terms affect currently used techniques for CGW searches with PTA data sets, that treat the pulsar term as an additional source noise. We focus on the dependency of the pulsar term frequencies on the pulsar's distance. We aim to answer the question of whether adding more distant pulsars to a PTA data set can mitigate biases and improve the detection of CGWs. We show that under ideal conditions, more distant pulsars can facilitate the CGW search with PTA data sets. Bayesian parameter estimation is yielding better parameter constraints and the frequentist per-frequentist optimal statistic search becomes more stable.

The spectral index $n_s$ of the primordial power spectrum provides a window into early universe, and constraints on $n_s$ play an important role in discriminating early universe models such as models of cosmic inflation. Historically constrained by cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments, the constraints on $n_s$ shift upward when CMB data is combined with the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Recent work explained the origin of this and the relation to the BAO-CMB tension between CMB experiments and DESI BAO, and as a case study presented constraints on $n_s$ from the combination of Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 data and DESI DR2 data. Here we present constraints from Planck (PR3 and PR4), ACT, the South Pole Telescope (SPT), and the combination of all three CMB experiments, CMB-SPA, with and without DESI DR2 BAO data, and with and without CMB lensing data. In all cases the constraint on $n_s$ is shifted upwards when DESI is included, with the largest shift exhibited by ACT. This is accompanied by a commensurate shift in the constraint on the optical depth to reionization $τ$, which is again greatest for ACT. When CMB data are combined into CMB-SPA and combined with DESI the $n_s$ constraint disfavors at more than $2σ$ the inflation models preferred by Planck alone, such as Higgs, Starobinsky, and exponential $α$-attractors, in favor of other models, such as polynomial $α$-attractors. This work motivates the further study of the tension between CMB and DESI BAO data, and of the rich interplay between $n_s$ and $τ$."}

Bose"], "title": "Probing TeV Afterglow Emission of GRB~221009A with Gaussian Structured jet in Wind-driven medium", "comment": "12 pages, 8 figures", "summary": "Recent detections of very high energy (VHE; GeV-TeV) photons from gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows, most notably the extreme event GRB 221009A, require refined models that include realistic jet structures and complex circumburst environments. The jet's angular structure is crucial for shaping afterglow emission. Our recent work demonstrates that Gaussian jets, with their smooth angular decline, naturally produce early bright peaks for on-axis observers and delayed, softer, dimmer peaks at higher inclinations. The gradual decline suppresses excessive lateral expansion, unlike the sharp edge in top-hat jets, making Gaussian jets a compelling alternative to both top-hat and other structured-jet models. Here we implement a Gaussian structured-jet model to explain TeV afterglows from adiabatic forward shocks propagating in a wind-driven medium. We show that the TeV peak time and flux depend sensitively on jet geometry, kinetic energy, wind density, and on microphysical parameter ratios that scale the SSC component. We identify the afterglow parameter space that is favourable for detecting sub-TeV photons with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), finding that only about ten per cent of simulated TeV events exceed CTA sensitivity in a wind medium. These detections arise from near core-aligned views, with high kinetic energy and wind density, moderate initial Lorentz factor and downstream magnetic field, and a relatively large fraction of energy in nonthermal electrons. Applying this model to GRB 221009A, we perform multi-band fits including wind-modified dynamics, Klein-Nishina effects, and EBL attenuation, and find that a mildly off-axis geometry reproduces the observed X-ray and GeV-TeV light curves."}

Such an accretion disk can produce unbound wind ejecta, with synthesized $^{56}\\mathrm{Ni}$ mixed in. Numerical simulations reveal that this unbound ejecta should be strongly polar-dominated, which may cause the following radioactive-powered thermal transient to be viewing-angle-dependent. This issue has so far received limited investigation.\n  We investigate how the intrinsically non-spherical geometry of WD-NS wind ejecta affects the viewing-angle dependence of the thermal transients. Using a two-dimensional axisymmetric ejecta configuration and incorporating heating from the radioactive decay of $^{56}\\mathrm{Ni}$, we employ a semi-analytical discretization scheme to simulate the observed viewing-angle-dependent photospheric evolution, as well as the resulting spectra and lightcurves. The observed photosphere evolves over time and depends strongly on the viewing angle: off-axis observers can see deeper, hotter inner layers of the ejecta and larger projected photospheric areas compared to on-axis observers. For a fiducial WD-NS merger producing 0.3 solar mass of ejecta and 0.01 solar mass of synthesized $^{56}\\mathrm{Ni}$, the resulting peak optical absolute magnitudes of the transient span from ~ -12 mag along the polar direction to ~ -16 mag along the equatorial direction, corresponding to luminosities of $10^{40}$-$10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The typical peak timescales are expected to be 3-10 d. We for the first time explore the viewing-angle effect on WD-NS merger transients. Since their ejecta composition and energy sources resemble those of supernovae, yet WD-NS merger transients are dimmer and evolve more rapidly, we propose using \"mini-supernovae\" to describe the thermal emission following WD-NS mergers."}

Rubin Observatory's 10-Year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to produce a hundredfold increase in the number of transients we observe. However, there are insufficient spectroscopic resources to follow up on all of the wealth of targets that LSST will provide. As such it is necessary to be able to prioritise objects for followup observations or inclusion in sample studies based purely on their LSST photometry. We are particularly keen to identify tidal disruption events (TDEs) with LSST. TDEs are immensely useful for determining black hole parameters and probing our understanding of accretion physics. To assist in these efforts, we present the Many Artificial LSST Lightcurves based on the Observations of Real Nuclear transients (MALLORN) data set and the corresponding classifier challenge for identifying TDEs. MALLORN comprises 10178 simulated LSST light curves, constructed from real Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations of 64 TDEs, 727 nuclear supernovae and 1407 AGN with spectroscopic labels using Gaussian process fitting, empirically-motivated spectral energy distributions from SNCosmo and the baseline from the Rubin Survey Simulator. Our novel approach can be easily adapted to simulate transients for any photometric survey using observations from another, requiring only the limiting magnitudes and an estimate of the cadence of observations. The MALLORN Astronomical Classification Challenge, launched on Kaggle on 15/10/2025, will allow competitors to test their photometric classifiers on simulated LSST data to find TDEs and improve upon their capabilities prior to the start of LSST."}

Using VLT/MUSE integral field spectroscopy, we uncover chemical and kinematic connections between the nebula surrounding its Central Compact Object (CXOU J085201.4-461753) and the nearby Herbig-Haro outflow of Ve 7-27 (Wray 16-30), indicating a shared nitrogen-rich, Fe-peak-enhanced environment. This link ties stellar birth and death, with the young star Ve 7-27 embedded in material expelled by Vela Junior's massive progenitor, and the remnant's blast wave is expanding through the same medium. Adopting the Gaia-based distance to Ve 7-27, we revise Vela Junior's distance to $1.41\\pm0.14$ kpc. At this distance, the remnant's physical radius is $23.3\\pm2.3$ pc, and X-ray proper motions of the northwestern rim correspond to shock speeds of $(2.8\\pm0.7)\\times10^3$ to $(5.6\\pm1.5)\\times10^3$ km s$^{-1}$. These imply an age of $\\sim$1.6-3.3 kyr and a very low ambient density, indicating that Vela Junior is expanding within a highly rarefied wind-blown cavity carved by a massive progenitor -- consistent with the non-detection of strong thermal X-ray emission. This distance update also resolves long-standing inconsistencies, with major implications for its energy budget, particle acceleration efficiency, and compact object evolution."}

A comprehensive fitting framework is developed, constrained by prior knowledge of moment of inertia participation from previous glitch studies. We apply a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to quantify uncertainties and parameter correlations. The model reproduces the observed timing data and yields physically consistent values for moment of inertia fractions and creep timescales. Our results indicate that inward creep and a long-term change in external torque dominate the observed increase in spin-down rate, pointing to structural changes within the star-likely triggered by a crustquake that initiated both vortex motion and a change in the moment of inertia. We estimate that the glitch involved approximately $2.4 \\times 10^{12}$ inward-moving vortices and $\\sim 142$ crustal plates with a typical size of $\\sim 0.03$ km. This study demonstrates that detailed post-glitch modeling of sparse timing data can simultaneously constrain internal superfluid dynamics and external torque evolution, providing a quantitative framework to probe the structural properties of neutron star interiors."}

At even higher rigidities, direct detection is making contact with indirect observations from air shower arrays. A number of breaks have been found in the nuclear spectrum, which was previously thought to be a pure power law up to the knee. Data from air shower arrays also show interesting features in the arrival directions of cosmic-ray nuclei. On the theoretical side, more sophisticated models are able to explain the various spectral breaks either with transitions between different classes of sources or with changes in the transport regime. Yet, it has become clear that our ignorance of the structure of the Galactic magnetic fields, both on large and small scales, is limiting precision predictions. Turning this problem into an opportunity though, we can use Galactic cosmic rays as a laboratory for the study of Galactic magnetic fields. In this review talk, delivered at the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC2025), I have summarised what is known about the spectrum and anisotropies of Galactic cosmic rays, what is not known yet and what can be learnt in the future."}

With its fast spin and unusually low magnetic field, this NS has evidently experienced unusual evolution, likely connected with its high mass, which is now $2.5σ$ above that of the heaviest pulsar with a white dwarf companion, as measured by Shapiro delay techniques. By tightening the mass measurement, we also raise the maximum (commonly called Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff) NS mass to $M_{\\rm TOV} > 2.27\\,M_\\odot$$(2.12\\,M_\\odot)$ at $1σ$$(3σ)$ confidence, which improves bounds on the dense-matter equation of state.

Recent cosmological simulations such as FLAMINGO calibrate their feedback model on the baryon fractions of galaxy groups to tune the efficiency of gas ejection. However, recent observational constraints from optically selected groups and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect yield lower baryon fractions than previous studies, which indicates that feedback may be more ejective than previously thought. Here we show that models involving highly ejective feedback are inconsistent with the scaling relations of local galaxy groups in the mass range $10^{13}-10^{14}M_\\odot$. We study the X-ray luminosity-temperature relation in a sample of 44 galaxy groups with high-quality XMM-Newton observations. We show that highly ejective models under-predict the luminosity of galaxy groups at fixed mass at high significance ($5.7σ$). This conclusion is robust against selection effects and is obtained from directly measurable and minimally correlated quantities. We point out that turning observable quantities into gas fraction estimates is challenging, especially in the context of stacking large samples of heterogeneous systems. We argue that calibrating feedback models on baryon fractions is prone to systematic uncertainties and that observable scaling relations are better suited for this task."}

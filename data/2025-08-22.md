TL;DR: 通过高分辨率三维磁流体动力学模拟研究碰撞风双星系统中的粒子加速机制，发现湍流和磁场复杂性主导加速过程，而非经典扩散激波加速，CWBs可将强子粒子加速至PeV能量级别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期观测发现恒星形成区可能是TeV宇宙线的起源地，而非超新星遗迹。碰撞风双星(CWBs)作为强X射线和射电同步辐射源，被认为是这类粒子的潜在加速器

Method: 采用高分辨率三维磁流体动力学模拟耦合测试粒子积分方法，研究局部等离子体条件如何影响CWBs中的粒子加速

Result: 发现最大粒子能量和能量分布硬度取决于激波磁化程度和冷却效率。在中等磁化条件下(>1G)，CWBs可将强子粒子加速至数百TeV甚至PeV能量，超过1%的粒子达到甚高能范围

Conclusion: 湍流和磁场驱动过程是CWBs中产生相对论性粒子的关键机制，这对未来高灵敏度γ射线观测(如LACT和CTAO)具有重要意义

Abstract: Recent observations have revealed star-forming regions as possible origin
sites of very-high-energy (TeV) cosmic rays, not associated with supernova
remnants. Colliding-wind binaries (CWBs) are strong X-ray and radio synchrotron
emitters and have been proposed as potential accelerators of such particles. We
perform high-resolution three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations
coupled with test-particle integration to investigate how local plasma
conditions affect particle acceleration in CWBs. We find that the maximum
particle energies and the hardness of the energy distributions depend on the
shock magnetization and cooling efficiency. For moderate magnetization ($\gt$1
G), CWBs can accelerate hadronic particles up to hundreds of TeV or even PeV
energies, with more than 1\% of particles reaching the very-high-energy range.
By correlating the local acceleration rate with plasma quantities -
\textit{magnetic field strength, current density, vorticity, and velocity
divergence} - we show that turbulence and magnetic field complexity dominate
the acceleration, while classical diffusive shock acceleration plays a limited
role. These results suggest that turbulent, magnetically driven processes are
key to producing relativistic particles in CWBs, with implications for future
high sensitivity $\gamma$-ray observations (e.g. LACT and CTAO).

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a pseudo-Newtonian stationary circumbinary slim disk model. We
extend the slim disk formalism by including the binary tidal torque and solve
the resulting steady-state equations to determine the circumbinary disk
structure. We compare the binary slim disk solutions with corresponding binary
thin disk solutions, calculate the disk spectrum, explore the impact of
different parameters on the system, and estimate the binary shrinkage
timescale. We find that; (1) due to the different disk density profiles, the
integrated tidal torque exerted on the disk is significantly smaller for the
slim disk than for the thin disk; as a result thin disks onto binary black
holes can be radiatively significantly more efficient than slim disks; (2) The
presence of the secondary alters the emission of the circumbinary disk, making
it different from the spectrum of a single black hole Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN); (3) The tidal torque boosts the viscous torque in the outer part of the
disk (radii greater than the binary separation), which is strongly dependent on
the disk parameters, including the binary mass ratio $q$, the orbital
separation $a$, the viscous parameter $\alpha$ and the accretion rate $\dot M$;
(4) The vertical component of the potential of the secondary slightly decreases
the integrated tidal torque. However, both the vertical and radial components
of the potential of the secondary have small impact on the disk radiative flux;
(5) Using the integrated disk tidal torque backreacting on the secondary at
different orbital separations, we find that the disk provides an efficient way
to shrink the binary orbital separation.

TL;DR: 使用Chandra HRC数据分析Cassiopeia A中子星冷却速率，发现冷却速率比之前ACIS数据测量的更小，为中子星核心超流体转变理论提供支持


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证Cassiopeia A超新星遗踪中年轻中子星的快速冷却现象，并排除Chandra ACIS探测器系统异常的影响

Method: 利用Chandra HRC探测器25年的观测数据，偏向不同的氢列密度假设，分析中子星表面温度的冷却速率

Result: 固定氢列密度时冷却速率为0.57%/十年，变化氢列密度时为1.11%/十年，都低于ACIS测量值，但吸收流强的下降在4.7%±1.5%/十年水平上得到验证

Conclusion: HRC数据确认了Cas A中子星的冷却现象，但速率更慢，消除了与理论预测的矛盾，支持中子三重态超流体中微中子发射效率降低的理论

Abstract: The young neutron star (NS) in the Cassiopeia A (Cas A) supernova remnant is
a fascinating test for theories of NS cooling. Chandra observations have
indicated that its surface temperature is declining rapidly, about 2% per
decade, using 20 years of data, if a uniform carbon atmosphere is assumed for
the NS. This rapid decline may be caused by the neutrons in the NS core
transitioning from a normal to a superfluid state. However, most of the Cas A
NS observations were performed by the Chandra ACIS detectors, which suffer
complicated systematic effects. Here, we test the cooling of the Cas A NS with
Chandra HRC data over 25 years. The Chandra HRC detector has independent
systematics, serving as a cross-check. Assuming a fixed hydrogen column density
($N_{\rm H}$), we infer the cooling rate of the Cas A NS to be
0.57$^{+0.26}_{-0.27}$% per decade. Allowing the $N_{\rm H}$ to vary with time
(as estimated using ACIS data), the cooling rate is 1.11$^{+0.25}_{-0.28}$% per
decade. These cooling rates are smaller than measured using ACIS data, implying
systematic uncertainties have not been eradicated from either or both datasets.
However, we have verified the decline in the absorbed flux from the Cas A NS
using an independent instrument, at $>3\sigma$ level (4.7%$\pm$1.5% over 10
years). Additionally, the weaker cooling rate of Cas A NS inferred from HRC
datasets eliminates the tension with the theoretically predicted cooling, and
can be explained by the reduced efficiency of the neutrino emission
accompanying the Cooper pair breaking and formation process in neutron
triplet-state superfluid.

TL;DR: 提出通过千新星颜色演化来识别双中子星并合后残骸性质的方法，区分黑洞、磁星或稳定中子星等不同中央引擎


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GW170817引力波事件及其电磁对应体的首次直接探测开启了多信使天文学新窗口，但如何通过电磁辐射识别双中子星并合残骸仍是一个未解决的问题

Method: 假设千新星能量来自放射性衰变、磁星自转减速和脉冲星风云，分析热辐射和非热辐射情况下的颜色演化特征，比较不同中央引擎（黑洞、磁星、稳定中子星）对应的颜色演化模式

Result: 黑洞中央引擎时颜色演化在峰值前无变化但峰值后快速增加；磁星或稳定中子星中央引擎时颜色演化复杂，取决于磁星旋转能量和自转减速时标，最终趋于常数

Conclusion: 千新星颜色演化特征可作为识别双中子星并合后残骸性质的有效诊断工具，为多信使天文学研究提供新方法

Abstract: The first direct detection of the gravitational wave (GW) event GW170817 and
its electromagnetic (EM) counterpart open a new window for studying of
multi-messenger astronomy. However, how to identify the remnant of binary
neutron star (NS) merger via EM radiation remain an open question. In this
paper, we propose a method of color evolution of kilonova emission to identify
its progenitors. We assume that the energy of the kilonova is contributed from
radioactive decay, magnetar spin-down, and pulsar wind nebula (PWN). The color
evolution of kilonova emission associated with short GRB is significant when
the spectrum is thermal emission, while it tends towards a constant when the
spectrum is non-thermal radiation. On the other hand, if the central engine is
a black hole (BH) which is promptly generated by the NS-NS merger or NS-BH
merger, then the kilonova is powered only by the radioactive decay. There is no
color evolution at the beginning before the peak of kilonova emission, but is
significantly and rapidly increasing after the peak. On the contrary, if the
central engine is a magnetar or stable NS, the kilonova emission is contributed
from radioactive decay, magnetar, and PWN. The color evolution after the peak
of kilonova emission is complex behavior which depends on the rotational energy
and spin-down time-scale of magnetar, and finally tend to a constant in the
late state.

Abstract: Understanding the evolution of pulsar dispersion measures is vital to high
precision timing experiments, as well as astrometric experiments to determine
pulsar positions and proper motions. In this work, we present a novel approach
to measuring dispersion measure gradients using pulsar scintillometry. This
approach makes use of the multipath propagation through the interstellar medium
to simultaneously probe dispersion measures along multiple sight lines from a
single observation. Using existing data of PSR B0834+06, we are able to measure
gradients of $9.7\pm0.3\times10^{-6}~\rm{pc}~\rm{cm}^{-3}~\rm{mas}^{-1}$.

TL;DR: 本文开发了一种在流体动力学方程中包含r过程加热的方法，通过追踪粒子历史来研究其对中子星合并喷射物性质的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中子星合并产生r过程元素，其产率对喷射物的运动学和热力学性质敏感。GW170817的多信使探测表明需要可靠的喷射物预测来最大化未来事件的诊断潜力。

Method: 开发了一种在流体动力学方程中包含r过程加热作为源项的方法，依赖于局部流体性质和通过Cloud-in-Cell方法与网格交换信息的示踪粒子Ye历史。

Result: r过程加热可使未束缚盘喷射物质量增加约10%，并将Ye<0.25喷射物的径向速度提高最多两倍，同时抑制边缘束缚对流喷射物。

Conclusion: r过程加热对中子星合并喷射物性质有显著影响，包括增加喷射物质量和速度，这有助于更好地理解r过程元素产生和喷射物动力学。

Abstract: Neutron star mergers produce $r$-process elements, with yields that are
sensitive to the kinematic and thermodynamic properties of the ejecta. These
ejecta properties are potentially affected by dynamically-important feedback
from $r$-process heating, which is usually not coupled to the hydrodynamics in
post-merger simulations modeling the ejecta launching and expansion. The
multi-messenger detection of GW170817 showed the importance of producing
reliable ejecta predictions, to maximize the diagnostic potential of future
events. In this paper, we develop a prescription for including $r$-process
heating as a source term in the hydrodynamic equations. This prescription
depends on local fluid properties and on the $Y_{e}$ history as recorded by
dedicated tracer particles, which exchange information with the grid using the
Cloud-in-Cell method. The method is implemented in long-term viscous
hydrodynamic simulations of accretion disk outflows to investigate its feedback
on ejecta properties. We find that $r$-process heating can increase the unbound
disk ejecta mass by $\sim 10\%$ relative to a baseline case that only considers
alpha particle recombination. Nuclear heating also enhances the radial velocity
of the ejecta with $Y_e < 0.25$ by up to a factor of two, while concurrently
suppressing marginally-bound convective ejecta.

TL;DR: 球状星团对银河系弥漫伽马射线辐射的贡献很小，在TeV能段仅占约2%，在GeV能段小于1%，可忽略不计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近观测显示弥漫伽马射线辐射存在系统性超出，而部分球状星团已被探测到伽马射线辐射，未探测到的球状星团可能对弥漫辐射有重要贡献

Method: 使用非参数方法估计球状星团的光度函数和空间分布函数，基于Fermi-LAT第四源目录和参考球状星团目录，计算未解析球状星团对Fermi-LAT和LHAASO观测的累积贡献

Result: 球状星团在TeV能段仅贡献约2%的弥漫伽马射线辐射，在GeV能段小于1%，贡献可忽略

Conclusion: 未解析的球状星团对银河系弥漫伽马射线辐射的贡献非常有限，不能解释观测到的系统性超出

Abstract: The diffuse Galactic $\gamma$-ray emission (DGE) provides a valuable probe
for investigating the cosmic ray propagation and interactions within our
Galactic environment. Recent observations have demonstrated systematic excesses
of DGE compared with the conventional cosmic-ray propagation model predictions.
While $\gamma$-ray emissions have been detected in a subset of globular
clusters, their undetected populations may significantly contribute to the DGE.
Motivated by this possibility, we present a comprehensive assessment of
potential contributions from unresolved globular clusters to the DGE. In our
analysis, a nonparametric method is employed to estimate the luminosity
function and spatial distribution function of globular clusters using the
Fermi-LAT fourth source catalog (4FGL) combined with a reference globular
cluster catalog. Based on these distributions, we calculate the cumulative
contribution of unresolved globular cluster populations to the DGE observed by
Fermi-LAT and the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Our
results reveal that globular clusters account for only $\sim$2\% of the DGE at
the TeV range, and smaller than $1\%$ in the GeV regime, which is effectively
negligible.

Conclusion: 这项工作为通过未来引力波探测同时约束AGN通道和超大质量黑洞增长开辟了前景。

Abstract: The dense and gaseous environments of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can
catalyze repeated mergers of stellar-mass black holes (BHs), potentially
explaining the high-mass tail of binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed by
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK). We present a semi-analytical population synthesis
framework that captures key physical processes in AGN disks, including gas
capture, migration, binary pair-up, gas hardening, and dynamical binary-single
interactions. Our simulations show that AGN disks can produce hierarchical
mergers, especially near migration traps, and may contribute to the high-mass,
high-spin BBH population. This work opens prospects for constraining both the
AGN channel and supermassive black hole growth with future gravitational-wave
detections.

Conclusion: 这些结果展示了某些红背系统中骤引星成分的难以捕捉性，强调了需要多波长跟踪观测和更高频率无线电观测来限制源的性质和双星动力学

Abstract: Redback pulsars are a subclass of millisecond pulsar system with a low-mass
non-degenerate companion star being ablated by the pulsar. They are of interest
due to the insights they can provide for late-stage pulsar evolution during the
recycling process. J0523.5-2529 is one such candidate where redback-like
emission has been seen at multiple wavelengths except radio. It is a system
with a binary orbit of 16.5 hours and a low-mass non-degenerate companion of
approximately 0.8 solar masses. The aim of this work was to conduct follow-up
radio observations to search for any exhibited radio pulsar emission from
J0523.5-2529. This work employs a periodicity and single burst search across 74
percent of the system's orbital phase using a total of 34.5 hours of
observations. Observations were carried out using the Murriyang Telescope at
Parkes and the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT). Despite extensive
orbital phase coverage, no periodic or single-pulse radio emission was detected
above a signal-to-noise threshold of 7. A comprehensive search for radio
pulsations from J0523.5-2529 using Parkes and GBT yielded no significant
emission, likely due to intrinsic faintness, scattering, or eclipses by the
companion's outflow. The results demonstrate the elusiveness of the pulsar
component in some redback systems and highlight the need for multi-wavelength
follow-up and higher-frequency radio observations to constrain the source
nature and binary dynamics.

Abstract: In this paper we present a major update to the general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) code cuHARM, which adds fully covariant treatment
of radiation transport and the subsequent radiation backreaction on the
dynamics of the fluid. For the radiative calculations, we discretize and solve
the radiation transfer equation on a geodesic grid, in order to resolve the
angular distribution of the radiation field everywhere in space. This allows
for detailed treatment of non-isotropic radiation fields, which is crucial for
accurately resolving regions of intermediate optical depth. We present the
equations solved, the numerical methods used, and standard tests used to verify
the different aspects of a radiation hydrodynamics code, in particular
radiation transport and radiation-fluid interaction. We present an application
of the code to the case of black hole radiative accretion. This new radiation
module is fully GPU-accelerated and represents a major advance in the
capabilities of cuHARM.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 对重复快速射电暴FRB 20240114A在2.25GHz和8.60GHz的同步监测研究，发现其在2.25GHz频率下活动性高但在8.60GHz未检测到爆发，表现出明显的频率依赖性活动特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究重复快速射电暴在不同频率下的活动特性，了解其爆发机制和频谱特征。

Method: 使用上海天马射电望远镜在66次观测中同时监测2.25GHz和8.60GHz频率，累计约180小时观测时间。

Result: 在2.25GHz检测到155个爆发，8.60GHz未检测到爆发；发现频率依赖性活动、爆发能量遵循幂律分布、等待时间分布峰值在1019秒。

Conclusion: FRB 20240114A在8.60GHz的活动性比2.25GHz低至少两个数量级，表现出明显的频率选择性爆发特征。

Abstract: We report on the simultaneous monitoring of the repeating fast radio burst
(FRB) 20240114A at 2.25 and 8.60~GHz, conducted 66 times between 2024 January
29 and 2025 February 15 with the Shanghai Tianma Radio Telescope (TMRT). In
about 180 hours of observation, we detected 155 bursts at 2.25~GHz above a
fluence threshold of 0.72~Jy~ms, but none at 8.60~GHz above a fluence threshold
of 0.27~Jy~ms. FRB~20240114A exhibited frequency-dependent activity, as
evidenced by the non-detections in 14.3 hours of observations at 2.25~GHz prior
to 2024 February 24, despite its reported activity below 2~GHz. In contrast to
its low-activity state reported below 1.4~GHz between 2024 June and December,
FRB~20240114A exhibited high activity at 2.25~GHz in 2024 July with a mean
burst rate of $1.72^{+0.18}_{-0.16}~\rm{hr}^{-1}$, followed by a low-activity
state. We also detected a short-term reactivation at 2.25~GHz around 2025
January 20, about two weeks after renewed activity was reported below 1.4~GHz
by other telescopes. The median burst width at 2.25~GHz is 3~ms, which is
narrower than that at lower frequencies. The waiting time distribution peaks at
1019~s, and burst arrivals on hourly timescales consistent with a Poisson
process. The isotropic-equivalent energy of bursts spans $10^{37}
-10^{39}$~erg. The distribution of burst energy above the completeness
threshold ($7.5\times10^{37}$~erg) follows a power-law relation with an index
of $\gamma=-1.20\pm0.03\pm0.02$. Finally, we find that FRB~20240114A is at
least two orders of magnitude less active at 8.60~GHz than at 2.25~GHz, and we
constrain the broadband spectra of the detected bursts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观测到GW190425双中子星合并事件的总质量(3.4M⊙)显著高于巴克尼山时尾观测到的平均2.3-2.9M⊙范围，需要探索这种高质量双中子星系统的形成机制

Method: 使用1D星体演化代码MESA模拟初始质釼2.5-9.8M⊙的氮星在与1.4M⊙中子星伴星系统中的后期演化阶段，重点研究第二次不稳定质量转移等备选形成途径

Result: 模型与巴克尼山时尾观测到的双中子星质量和轨道分布符合良好，但只有很小部分双中子星质量达到≥3M⊙，不能解释重力波观测到的高频高质量合并事件，但排除了通过第二次不稳定质量转移形成GW190425类重双中子星系统的可能性

Conclusion: 高质量双中子星系统如GW190425可能需要非标准形成途径，当前的标准形成模型无法充分解释重力波观测到的高频高质量合并事件，需要进一步探索更多的形成机制

Abstract: More than 30 Galactic double neutron star (DNS) binaries have now been
identified through radio pulsar timing. The 24 DNSs in the Galactic field with
measured total masses lie in the narrow range of 2.3--2.9 $M_{\odot}$. In
contrast, gravitational-wave observations have detected two DNS mergers:
GW170817, with a total mass of 2.7 $M_{\odot}$, and GW190425, with a
significantly higher mass of 3.4 $M_{\odot}$. The unusually high mass of
GW190425 suggests a non-standard formation channel not represented in the known
Galactic population. To investigate the origin of such a massive DNS system, we
model the late evolutionary stages of helium stars with initial masses between
2.5 and 9.8 $M_{\odot}$ in binaries with 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ neutron star
companions, using the 1D stellar evolution code MESA at solar metallicity. We
test alternative formation pathways and calibrate our models to reproduce the
observed Galactic DNS mass and orbital distributions. By incorporating a
modified natal kick prescription, our population synthesis results are broadly
consistent with the observed total mass distribution of known DNS systems. Only
a small fraction of DNSs of our model have total masses $\geq$ 3 $M_{\odot}$,
insufficient to explain the high rate of massive DNS mergers inferred from GW
observations. However, our model rules out the formation of heavy DNS systems
like GW190425 via the second unstable mass transfer.

deepened by determining the locality of the emission. Pulsars in which the two
poles interact can potentially help solve this challenge. We here report the
discovery of interaction of emission between the main and the interpulse in two
pulsars -- J1842+0358 and J1926+0737, based on FAST and MeerKAT data. When
emission is bright in one pulse, it is dim in the other. Even when split in
just 2 groups (strong versus weak) the anti-correlated brightness can change by
a factor $\gtrsim$2. Both sources furthermore show the same quasi-periodic
modulation from the main and interpulse, at timescales exceeding 100 pulse
periods. The longitude stationary modulation from at least one pulse suggests
that it is a key signature for interpulse pulsars showing main and interpulse
interaction. If the interaction happens within an isolated magnetosphere,
without external influences, either communication between the opposite poles is
required, or global changes drive both. This detailed study of these two
sources was only made possible by improved sensitivity. The fact that both show
two-pole modulation strongly suggests this is a general phenomenon in
interpulse pulsars. In regular pulsars only one pole is visible, and a number
of these show correlated changes between the profile and spin-down rate, that
are also thought to be caused by global magnetospheric changes. Our results
strengthen the case that such interactive magnetospheres are common to all
pulsars.

TL;DR: 研究物质密度波动对中微子味道进化的影响，发现在球对称环境下这些波动对中微子味道转换影响微小可以忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查物质密度波动在中微子味道进化中的作用，特别是它们对碰撞项的影响，以了解这些波动是否会导致不稳定性或味道转换的重大变化。

Method: 使用球对称量子动力学方程(QKEs)，通过变化径向分辨率(150、1500、15000)来评估数值收敛性。在每个径向粒度中添加随机扰动，研究时间相关和时间无关的物质密度扰动对碰撞项的影响。

Result: 解在最粗粒度分辨率下已经数值收敛，更高分辨率产生几乎相同的结果。物质密度波动没有导致显著的不稳定性或味道进化的质性变化，角向结构保持稳健，味道依存的数密度和能量谱仅显示较小偏差。

Conclusion: 在球对称设置中，物质密度波动对中微子味道进化的影响微不足道，可以安全地忽略这些波动效应。

Abstract: We investigate the role of fluctuations in the matter density on neutrino
flavor evolution by studying their effects on the collision terms in the
spherically symmetric quantum kinetics equations (QKEs). We solve the QKEs with
varying radial resolution ($r_{\mathrm{bins}} = 150 \, , 1500 \, , 15000$) to
assess numerical convergence in angular distributions, number densities, and
energy spectra for four neutrino flavors ($\nu_e$, $\bar{\nu}_e$, $\nu_x$,
$\bar{\nu}_x$). Our results demonstrate that the solutions are numerically
converged already at the coarsest resolution, with higher resolutions yielding
almost identical outcomes. We introduce random perturbations to each radial
bin, thus adding perturbations with a length scale that is related to the
radial resolution. We study both time-independent and time-dependent
perturbations to the matter density that affect the collision term and analyze
their effects on neutrino flavor evolution. We find that such fluctuations do
not induce any significant instabilities or qualitative changes in flavor
evolution. Angular structure remains robust, and flavor-dependent number
densities and energy spectra show only minor deviations compared to the
unperturbed case. These findings suggest that matter perturbations have a
negligible effect on neutrino flavor evolution in spherically symmetric
settings.

### [15] [Disentangling the Origins of the NANOGrav Signal: Early Universe Models and $ΔN_{eff}$ Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15134)

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 该研究探讨早期宇宙随机引力波背景能否解释NANOGrav观测到的共同频谱过程，同时与当前和未来的CMB辐射测量保持一致。研究发现当前NANOGrav数据对ΔN_eff贡献可忽略，但未来PTA探测能力提升后，某些早期宇宙模型可能产生足够大的ΔN_eff被Simons Observatory探测到。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究早期宇宙随机引力波背景是否能够解释NANOGrav观测到的脉冲星计时阵列频谱，同时检验这些模型是否与CMB对额外辐射的测量限制相兼容。

Method: 计算多种早期宇宙模型对有效相对论性物种数ΔN_eff的贡献，包括暴胀、标量诱导引力波和亚稳态宇宙弦等模型，并与当前和未来的CMB探测阈值进行比较分析。

Result: 当前NANOGrav 15年数据集（敏感至60 nHz）对ΔN_eff的贡献可忽略，低于CMB探测阈值。但未来PTA探测能力达到1 μHz时，暴胀、SIGW和亚稳态宇宙弦等模型可能产生足够大的ΔN_eff，达到Simons Observatory的3.5σ探测水平。

Conclusion: 能够解释NANOGrav信号且与CMB限制兼容的早期宇宙模型必须预测ΔN_eff低于CMB极限，否则将被排除，表明NANOGrav信号可能源于天体物理源而非早期宇宙过程。

Abstract: We investigate whether an Early-Universe stochastic gravitational-wave
background (SGWB) can account for the common spectrum process reported by
NANOGrav, while also being consistent with current and projected CMB
measurements of extra radiation. We compute the contribution of effective
number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{eff}$, for a number of
Early-Universe models proposed to explain the pulsar timing array (PTA)
spectrum. We demonstrate that models predicting $\Delta N_{eff}$ above the CMB
limit would be firmly excluded, implying that the NANOGrav signal in tension
with these bounds must instead arise from astrophysical sources. We find that
current NANOGrav 15-year dataset, sensitive up to 60 nHz, gives a negligible
contribution to $\Delta N_{eff}$ and remains well below the present and future
CMB detection threshold. However, when we project future PTA capabilities
reaching upto 1 $\mu$Hz, even with our conservative estimate we find that
Inflation, Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGW), and metastable cosmic
strings can induce a $\Delta N_{eff}$ large enough for $>3.5\sigma$ detection
by the Simons Observatory.

Motivation: 理解赤道面团合并过程中能量在热和非热粒子群中的分布机制，特别是离子-电子平衡时间尺度对于确定能量分配至关重要

Method: 使用NuSTAR天文台约200千秒的观测数据，测量震波前线温度分布，对比立即加热模型和延迟平衡模型

Result: 观测结果支持延迟平衡模型，电子与离子需要(4.0±3.4)×10^8年时间才能达到热平衡，同时发现震波马趋数可能比之前估计的要低(M=2.8±0.7)

Conclusion: 这些结果提高了我们对密度低的等离子体系中热能量分配微观物理的理解，对赤道面团演化、大尺度结构形成和宇宙学都具有重要意义

Abstract: Galaxy cluster mergers drive powerful shock fronts that heat the
Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM) and accelerate particles, redistributing the energy
in a merger. Abell 665 is one of only a few clusters with such a powerful shock
($M \sim 3$) and provides a unique opportunity to study the thermalization
timescale of the ICM, particularly the electron-ion equilibration timescale.
Understanding this timescale is crucial for determining how energy from the
merger is distributed between thermal and non-thermal particle populations.
Using $\sim$200 ks of NuSTAR observations, we measure the temperature
distribution across the shock to distinguish between two heating models: (1) an
instant, collisionless model where ions and electrons are immediately heated at
the shock front, and (2) a collisional model where electrons are initially
adiabatically compressed at the shock and subsequently equilibrate with the
ions over $\sim$100 Myr. Our measurements favor the delayed equilibration
model, suggesting that electrons do not immediately reach thermal equilibrium
with the ions at the shock front and instead equilibrate over $t_{eq} = (4.0
\pm 3.4) \times 10^8$ yrs. Additionally, our temperature measurements indicate
that the Mach number may be lower than previously estimated ($M = 2.8 \pm
0.7$), suggesting that the shock strength has been overestimated in past
studies. These results add to our understanding of the microphysics governing
how thermal energy is distributed in diffuse plasmas like the ICM, with
implications for galaxy cluster evolution, large scale structure formation, and
cosmology.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索交互作用的多方程暗能模型作为解释延迟宇宙加速扩张的可行候选方案，通过观测数据约束模型参数并验证其物理意义。

Method: 使用马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛(MCMC)方法，结合Hubble77+BAO26、Hubble77+Pantheon⁺和Hubble77+BAO26+DESI DR2三组观测数据集，对交互多方程暗能模型进行参数约束分析。

Conclusion: 交互多方程暗能模型是一种可行的宇宙学模型，能够解释延迟宇宙加速扩张和相关的大尺度动力学，并支持能量在暗能与物质之间的转移。

Abstract: We investigate an interacting polytropic dark energy (PDE) model
characterised by the equation of state $p_{d} = \alpha
\rho_{d}^{\,1+\frac{1}{\beta}}$, where the interaction between dark energy and
pressureless matter is modelled via a linear coupling term $Q = 3\eta
H\rho_{d}$. The background dynamics are formulated by deriving the Hubble
parameter in the interacting scenario, and the model parameters are constrained
through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using three joint
observational data sets: Hubble77+BAO26, Hubble77+Pantheon$^+$, and
Hubble77+BAO26+DESI DR2. The resulting best-fit values of $(H_0, \Omega_{d0},
\eta) $ are
$(69.22^{+1.27}_{-1.24},\,0.73^{+0.02}_{-0.02},\,-0.22^{+0.10}_{-0.12})$,
$(69.23^{+1.27}_{-1.22},\,0.73^{+0.02}_{-0.02},\,-0.34^{+0.15}_{-0.17})$, and
$(67.77^{+1.26}_{-1.24},\,0.73^{+0.02}_{-0.02},\,\\-0.02^{+0.10}_{-0.11})$
respectively for the respective data combinations. Our results indicate a
positive energy density and negative pressure over the full redshift range,
with the evolution of the equation-of-state parameter and state finder
parameters placing the model firmly within the Quintessence regime. The study
of the deceleration parameter also reveals a shift from a decelerating to an
accelerating cosmic expansion. The estimated present age of the Universe is
$14\,\mathrm{Gyr}$, consistent with recent observational data. Furthermore, the
sign of $Q$ implies a current energy transfer from dark energy to matter. These
findings support the interacting PDE framework as a viable candidate for
explaining late-time cosmic acceleration and related large-scale dynamics.

TL;DR: 研究通过模拟数据分析，探讨了如何区分不同宿主星系权重模型对双黑洞并合事件的影响，发现在200次探测情况下对真实模型仅有轻微偏好，而在1000次探测情况下能明确区分真实模型与均匀权重模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双黑洞并合是引力波的重要来源，其宿主星系概率与星系特性相关，但目前宿主星系权重模型尚未准确确定，需要研究是否可以通过数据驱动方法区分不同模型。

Method: 使用gwcosmo引力波宇宙学工具，模拟LVK第五观测季的观测场景，构建MICECATv2模拟光谱星系目录，比较三种简单光度权重模型（r波段、g波段和均匀权重）的贝叶斯因子。

Result: 在约200次探测情况下，贝叶斯因子对真实模型仅显示轻微偏好；在约1000次探测情况下，能明确区分真实模型与均匀权重模型，这主要受少数定位精度高的事件驱动。

Conclusion: 通过足够数量的引力波事件探测，特别是定位精度高的少数事件，可以有效区分不同的宿主星系权重模型，为理解双黑洞并合的宿主星系特性提供数据支持。

Abstract: Binary black hole (BBH) mergers,, an important source of
gravitational-waves(GWs), are assumed to be hosted in galaxies. The probability
of a galaxy to host a BBH is related to its properties, for example stellar
mass and star formation rate. These properties can be estimated from
observables, such as the luminosity in certain observation bands. We refer to
this description of host galaxy properties as host galaxy weighting models.
However, the host galaxy weighting model for BBHs has yet to be accurately
determined. Population synthesis has provided a variety of host galaxy
weighting models. Here we investigate whether it is possible to distinguish
different host galaxy weighting models using a data driven approach. We use the
GW cosmology tool gwcosmo with a simulated IGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) fifth
observing run (O5)-like observing scenario. We also construct a mock
spectroscopic galaxy catalogue from MICECATv2. Our analysis compares the Bayes
factors among three simple luminosity weighting models, r-band, g-band, and
uniform weighting. The Bayes factors among different host galaxy weighting
models show a minor preference for the true model for a ~200-detection case,
and a decisive preference for the true model over the uniform model for a
~1000-detection case, which is strongly driven by a small number of
well-localised events.

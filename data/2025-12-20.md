TL;DR: 使用BeppoSAX卫星WFC仪器数据（1996-2002年）搜索持续时间1秒至1天的快速X射线暂现源，发现149个事件，包括100个伽马暴、38个恒星耀斑和11个高质量X射线双星耀斑，其中63个是新发现。

Motivation: 利用BeppoSAX卫星的历史数据系统搜索快速X射线暂现源，以发现新的伽马暴、X射线闪、恒星耀斑和高质量X射线双星耀斑事件，填补文献空白并验证新观测仪器的结果。

Method: 分析BeppoSAX卫星WFC仪器1996年6月至2002年4月的观测数据，搜索持续时间1秒至1天的快速X射线暂现源，排除银河系中子星的I型和II型X射线暴，对检测到的事件进行分类和识别。

Result: 检测到149个快速X射线暂现事件，其中63个是文献中首次报道。包括：100个伽马暴（24个新发现），38个来自22颗邻近恒星的耀斑（3颗恒星首次观测到X射线或光学耀斑），11个来自已知高质量X射线双星的耀斑。37%的X射线探测伽马暴被分类为X射线闪。

Conclusion: 快速X射线暂现源的持续时间和光谱硬度分布呈双峰特征：短于1千秒的硬谱事件主要为伽马暴和X射线闪，长于1千秒的软谱事件主要为邻近晚型恒星和X射线双星的耀斑。BeppoSAX-WFC的样本与爱因斯坦探针的观测结果一致。

Abstract: We performed a search for fast X-ray transients (FXTs), with durations longer than one second and less than one day, through data of the Wide Field Camera (WFC) instrument onboard the BeppoSAX X-ray observatory collected between June 1996 and April 2002. (..) We focused our search on gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), X-ray flashes (XRFs), X-ray flares from high-mass X-ray binaries and stellar flares, while Type-I and II X-ray bursts from Galactic neutron stars were excluded. 149 such fast transient events were detected. 63 of these are new to the literature. 38 flares are identified with 22 nearby stars. Three stars have never been seen flaring before in X-rays or optical (NLTT 51688, GR Dra and UCAC4 255-003783). We find that the MeV transient GRO J1753+57 is most likely the same object as GR Dra rather than an AGN as previously thought. Eleven flares were detected from known high-mass X-ray binaries with irregular wind accretion (four of which are of the subclass of supergiant fast X-ray transients). 100 GRBs were identified of which 24 have not been published before. We classify 37% of the X-ray detected GRBs as XRFs with relatively large X-ray to gamma-ray flux ratio, gamma-rays being measured with the BeppoSAX Gamma Ray Burst Monitor. The duration/spectral hardness distribution of all FXTs is bimodal, separating the group roughly in transients shorter and longer than 1 ksec and with relatively hard and soft spectra, respectively. We identify the 'short' FXTs as GRBs and XRFs and the `long' FXTs as flares from nearby late-type stars and X-ray binaries. The BeppoSAX-WFC FXT sample is found to be consistent with the one observed by Einstein Probe, when the sensitivity of the two instruments is taken into account.

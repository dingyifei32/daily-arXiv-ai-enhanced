In this\nwork, we focus on the bubble collision predicted by the eternal inflation\ntheory, which can leave distinct azimuthally symmetric patterns on the\nsuperhorizon scales, potentially detectable through the RDF and RQF. We present\nthe first analytic expression of the RQF signal induced by bubble collision and\nvalidate it against numerical calculations performed with\n$\\texttt{RemoteField}$, a new public software tool we developed, finding\nexcellent agreement between the two. Combining our new RQF calculation with the\ncorresponding RDF signal calculated by prior work, we forecast the constraining\npower on bubble collision parameters using RDF/RQF reconstruction. We find\nthat, for an CMB-S4-like and an LSST-like experiment, the RDF reconstruction\ncan provide comparable constraining power as that from the primary CMB alone;\nand the RQF reconstruction can improve the constraining power by about an order\nof magnitude. We argue that these constraints can be improved further by\nincluding more RDF/RQF multipoles included and by using tomographic techniques\nto mitigate the standard $\\Lambda$CDM signal.

On linear scales we recover the suppression of structures\nobtained from Boltzmann codes, while non-linear scales exhibit an enhancement\nof the matter power. We find that fewer massive halos are formed at low\nredshift as a consequence of the elastic interaction and that dark matter halos\nare more compact than in the standard model.

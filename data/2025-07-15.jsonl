Our analysis suggests that if the stars involved in GW170817 were\nBECSs, the scattering length of their constituent bosons should fall within the\n$4$ to $10$ fm range. Additionally, at a scattering length of $a\\sim 3.1-4$ fm,\nstars with mass and radius characteristics akin to XMMU J173203.3-344518 are\nidentified.

However, recent observations suggest potential deviations from this\nassumption, hinting at a small anisotropic expansion. Such an expansion can\narise from sources that break rotational invariance. A minimal realization of\nthis scenario is described by a Bianchi I geometry, where each spatial\ndirection evolves at a different rate, and the degree of anisotropy is\nquantified by the shear parameter $\\Sigma$. In this work, we constrain the\npresent-day value of the shear, $\\Sigma_0$, by confronting theoretical\npredictions with recent cosmological data. We implement various anisotropic\nmodels within the Boltzmann code \\texttt{CLASS} and explore their parameter\nspace using the sampler \\texttt{MontePython}. Although our results show that\n$\\Sigma_0$ is model-dependent, notably, in one specific scenario considering a\nhomogeneous scalar field coupled to a 2-form field, $\\Sigma_0 = 0$ is excluded\nat the $2\\sigma$ confidence level, with mean value around $|\\Sigma_0| \\sim\n10^{-4}$ while remaining consistent with observations. These findings challenge\nthe conventional assumption that cosmic shear is negligible in the present\nuniverse. Moreover, the anisotropic expansion in this model is driven by a\nsteep scalar field potential, a feature often found in supergravity-inspired\nscenarios. While anisotropic models offer interesting alternatives and could\nhelp explain some cosmological anomalies, they generally introduce additional\nparameters, making the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model statistically favored in\nmost cases. Still, they remain compatible with current observations and provide\nnew perspectives on features not fully explained within the standard framework.\nThese results highlight the importance of further exploring anisotropic\ncosmologies to better understand their implications."}

Analyses of these simulations critically\ndepend on accurately identifying and tracking dark matter subhalos over time.\nIn recent years, several new algorithms have been developed to improve the\naccuracy and consistency of subhalo tracking in cold dark matter simulations.\nThese algorithms should be revisited in the context of new physics beyond\ngravity, which can modify the evolution and final properties of subhalo\npopulations. In this work, we apply the particle-tracking-based subhalo finder\nSymfind to velocity-dependent self-interacting dark matter simulations with\nlarge cross section amplitudes to assess the performance of particle-tracking\nmethods beyond the CDM paradigm. We find that the core-particle-tracking\ntechnique, which is key to the success of these algorithms in CDM, does not\nalways yield accurate results in SIDM. The interplay between dark matter\nself-interactions and tidal stripping can cause the diffusion of core particles\nto larger radii, leading particle-tracking-based algorithms to prematurely lose\ntrack of SIDM subhalos. For massive core-expansion subhalos and core-collapse\nsubhalos that experience close or repeated pericentric passages, a significant\nfraction of core particles can be lost, and particle-tracking-based finders\nsuch as Symfind offer no clear advantage over traditional methods that rely on\nidentifying phase-space overdensities. On the other hand, for subhalos with\nlarge pericentric distances or fewer, more distant passages, Symfind tends to\noutperform. These differences depend sensitively on the cross section amplitude\nand turnover velocity of the underlying SIDM model. We therefore recommend a\nhybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both techniques to produce\ncomplete and robust catalogs of core-expansion and core-collapse SIDM subhalos."}

The new X-ray transient\nMAXI J0709$-$159 was discovered on 2022 January 25. Due to the transient X-ray\nbehavior characterized by the short (a few hours) outburst duration, rapid\n($\\lesssim$ 1 s) variability with spectral change, and large luminosity swing\nfrom $10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to $10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$, the object was\nconsidered likely to be a supergiant X-ray binary with a neutron star (NS)\ncategorized as a Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient (SFXT). Follow-up NICER and\nNuSTAR observations confirmed that the position of the new X-ray object is\nconsistent with a Be star, LY CMa, which has been also identified as a B\nsupergiant. We analyzed the NICER data obtained from 3 hours to 6 days after\nthe discovery. The light curve reveals that the X-ray activity continued for\n$\\sim7$ hours in sparse short flares, each lasting $\\lesssim 100$ seconds, and\nthe luminosity instantaneously reached up to $\\sim 1\\times 10^{38}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$. The light-curve and spectral features reasonably agree with those\nexpected from accretion of a clumpy stellar-wind onto a magnetized NS. The\nvariability power spectrum during the brightest flare shows a broad peak at\n$1.1$ Hz resembling a quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO).

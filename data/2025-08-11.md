### [1] [A Targeted Gamma-Ray Search of Five Prominent Galaxy Merger Systems with 17 years of Fermi-LAT Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06232)
*Siddhant Manna,Shantanu Desai*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文研究了五个星系合并系统的γ射线发射，利用16.8年的Fermi-LAT数据，发现NGC~3256和NGC~660有微弱信号，其他系统未检测到。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 星系合并是能量极高的天体物理现象，可能驱动宇宙射线加速并产生γ射线，研究其γ射线发射有助于理解合并驱动的物理过程。

Method: 使用16.8年的Fermi-LAT数据，在1-300 GeV能量范围内进行分箱最大似然分析，建模为幂律谱并推导谱能量分布。

Result: NGC~3256和NGC~660检测到微弱γ射线信号，其他系统未检测到。

Conclusion: 星系合并驱动的恒星形成可能贡献γ射线发射，这是首次针对这些合并系统的γ射线研究。

Abstract: Galaxy mergers are among the most energetic astrophysical phenomena, driving
intense star formation and potentially fueling cosmic ray acceleration, which
can produce high energy $\gamma$-ray emission through hadronic processes. We
present a targeted search for $\gamma$-ray emission from five prominent galaxy
merger systems, NGC~3256, NGC~660, UGC~813/816, UGC~12914/12915, and VV~114
using 16.8 years of Fermi-LAT data in the 1--300~GeV energy range. Employing a
binned maximum likelihood analysis, we model the emission with power-law
spectra and derive spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to constrain
$\gamma$-ray fluxes and spectral indices. Marginal detections are found for
NGC~3256 (TS = 15.4, $\sim$3.51$\sigma$) and NGC~660 (TS = 8.16,
$\sim$2.39$\sigma$), with photon fluxes of $(7.21 \pm 3.17) \times 10^{-11}$
and $(8.28 \pm 3.56) \times 10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively,
suggesting merger driven star formation contributes to $\gamma$-ray emission.
The remaining systems yield non-detections (TS $< 5$). This is the first
targeted study of $\gamma$-ray emission from these aforementioned galaxy merger
systems.

### [2] [The Consequences of Rubin Observatory Time-Domain Survey Design and Host-Galaxy Contamination on the Identification of Binary Supermassive Black Holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05742)
*Megan C. Davis,Jonathan R. Trump,Maria Charisi,Jessie C. Runnoe,W. N. Brandt,Kaylee E. Grace,London E. Willson*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究探讨了宿主星系污染和观测设计对双超大质量黑洞（SMBHs）探测的影响，发现观测时长对探测效果至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双SMBHs是星系合并的产物，但其周期性信号易与单类星体的自然变异性混淆，导致探测困难。

Method: 模拟了数百万个LSST光变曲线，应用简单的正弦曲线拟合作为探测方法。

Result: 宿主星系污染会增加假阳性率并降低参数恢复率；观测时长比观测频率对探测效果影响更大。

Conclusion: 延长观测时间（尤其是从5年到10年）能显著提高双SMBHs的探测效果和假阳性抑制。

Abstract: Binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are consequences of galaxy mergers
and dominate the low-frequency gravitational wave background. Finding binary
SMBHs in existing time-domain observations has proven difficult, as their
periodic, electromagnetic signals can be confused with the natural variability
of single quasars. In this work, we investigate the effects of host-galaxy
contamination and survey design (cadence and duration) on the detectability of
binary SMBHs with the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and
Time (LSST). We simulate millions of LSST light curves of single and binary
quasars, with a distribution of quasar and host-galaxy properties motivated by
empirical observations and the anticipated LSST detection space. We then apply
simple sinusoidal curve fits as a potential, computationally inexpensive
detection method. We find that host-galaxy contamination will increase
false-positive rates and decrease binary parameter recovery rates. Lower mass,
lower luminosity binary systems are most likely to be negatively affected by
host galaxy contamination. We also find that monitoring duration affects binary
detection more than survey effective cadence for this detection method. As the
light curve duration increases, false-positive rates are suppressed and binary
parameter recovery rates, especially for binary period, are improved.
Increasing the light curve duration from 5 to 10 yrs shows the most dramatic
improvement for successful binary detection and false-positive rejection, with
additional improvement from extending the light curve duration to 20 yrs. The
observation duration increase is especially critical for recovering binary
periods that are longer than a decade.

### [3] [Fermi-LAT Galactic Center Excess morphology of dark matter in simulations of the Milky Way galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06314)
*Moorits Mihkel Muru,Joseph Silk,Noam I. Libeskind,Stefan Gottloeber,Yehuda Hoffman*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文探讨了银河系中心伽马射线过剩的两种解释：暗物质自湮灭和古老毫秒脉冲星群，并预测了暗物质模型的非球形伽马射线形态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究银河系中心伽马射线过剩的成因，区分暗物质自湮灭和古老毫秒脉冲星群这两种解释。

Method: 利用Hestia模拟中的类似银河系星系，分析中心暗物质分布的形态。

Result: 预测暗物质模型会产生显著非球形的伽马射线形态。

Conclusion: 未来的高能实验（如切伦科夫望远镜阵列）有望区分这两种解释。

Abstract: The strongest experimental evidence for dark matter is the Galactic Center
gamma-ray excess observed by the Fermi telescope and even predicted prior to
discovery as a potential dark matter signature via WIMP dark matter
self-annihilations. However, an equally compelling explanation of the excess
gamma-ray flux appeals to a population of old millisecond pulsars that also
accounts for the observed boxy morphology inferred from the bulge old star
population. We employ a set of Milky Way-like galaxies found in the Hestia
constrained simulations of the local universe to explore the rich morphology of
the central dark matter distribution, motivated by the GAIA discovery of a
vigorous early merging history of the Milky Way galaxy. We predict a
significantly non-spherical gamma-ray morphology from the WIMP interpretation.
Future experiments, such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array, that extend to
higher energies, should distinguish between the competing interpretations.

*Unnati Kashyap,Thomas J. Maccarone,Eliot C. Pattie,Mason Ng,Swati Ravi,Herman L. Marshall*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究利用IXPE和VLA对中子星低质量X射线双星GX 13+1进行了X射线和射电偏振研究，发现其在不同状态下的偏振变化，并探讨了其几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究中子星低质量X射线双星GX 13+1的几何结构和偏振特性，以理解其物理机制。

Method: 使用IXPE和VLA进行X射线和射电偏振观测，并结合NICER数据进行分析。

Result: 发现GX 13+1在Z态下表现出X射线偏振变化，几何结构可能包括吸积盘和边界层。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了GX 13+1的复杂几何结构，为理解中子星双星系统提供了新视角。

Abstract: We report the X-ray and radio polarization study of the neutron star (NS)
low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) GX 13+1 using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry
Explorer (IXPE) and Very Large Array (VLA). Simultaneous Neutron Star Interior
Composition Explorer (NICER) observations show that the source was in parts of
the Z state during our IXPE observations, exhibiting moderate changes in the
hardness intensity diagram. The source exhibits X-ray dips in the light curve
along with hints of polarization swings between the dip and non-dip states. The
X-ray spectro-polarimetry results suggest a source geometry comprising an
accretion disk component representing the softer disk emission, along with a
blackbody representing the harder emission from the boundary layer (BL) or a
spreading layer (SL). We investigate the geometry of GX 13+1 by considering our
X-ray and radio polarization findings.

### [5] [Fast Radio Bursts from non-resonant Alfvén waves and synchrotron maser emission in the magnetar wind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05840)
*Killian Long,Asaf Pe'er*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 非共振阿尔芬波与相对论等离子体相互作用形成粒子数反转，支持同步辐射微波激射（SME），解释了快速射电暴（FRB）的频率和能量特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究FRB的起源机制，尤其是其频率和能量特征如何通过同步辐射微波激射在磁星风中产生。

Method: 计算SME的峰值频率，分析磁星风中的洛伦兹因子、温度和磁星参数对FRB的影响。

Result: 洛伦兹因子γ_w≳310和温度θ≲0.02时，可产生FRB特征频率和能量。磁星参数与观测一致需磁层受耀发活动扰动。

Conclusion: 通过FRB观测可探测环境参数（如温度和磁化率），磁星风中的SME机制是FRB的潜在解释。

Abstract: Non-resonant interactions between Alfv\'en waves and a relativistic plasma
result in the formation of the population inversions necessary for synchrotron
maser emission (SME) across a wide range of magnetisations and temperatures. We
calculate the peak frequencies of the SME resulting from this interaction and
show that the characteristic frequencies and energetics of fast radio bursts
(FRBs) can be produced in the relativistic wind of a magnetar using this
mechanism. Wind Lorentz factors of $\gamma_w\gtrsim310$ are shown to be
necessary to explain observed FRBs. Emission is possible at temperatures of
$\theta = k_bT/mc^2\lesssim 0.02$. We further examine the periods and magnetic
fields of the central magnetar and demonstrate that the optimal values of these
properties align with the observed magnetar population provided that the
magnetosphere is disturbed by the flaring activity. These results allow the
properties of the environment such as temperature and magnetisation to be
probed from the observed FRB frequency and luminosity.

### [6] [Assessing Universal Relations for Rapidly Rotating Neutron Stars: Insights from an Interpretable Deep Learning Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05850)
*Grigorios Papigkiotis,Georgios Vardakas,Nikolaos Stergioulas*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文研究了中子星物理中的普适关系，利用神经网络模型提出新的EoS不敏感关系，并引入SHAP方法解释预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究中子星物理中的普适关系，以增强对高密度状态方程的理解，并利用多信使天文学数据。

Method: 使用前馈神经网络作为回归模型，提出新的EoS不敏感关系，并采用SHAP方法解释预测。

Result: 提出的关系在大多数情况下精度在1%以内，神经网络在复杂参数区域表现更优。

Conclusion: 高度准确的普适关系结合可解释性方法，有望约束中子星高密度状态方程，推动新观测数据的理解。

Abstract: Relations between stellar properties independent of the nuclear equation of
state offer profound insights into neutron star physics and have practical
applications in data analysis. Commonly, these relations are derived from
utilizing various realistic nuclear cold hadronic, hyperonic, and hybrid EoS
models, each of which should obey the current constraints and cover a wide
range of stiffnesses. Concurrently, the field of multimessenger astronomy has
been significantly enhanced by the advent of gravitational wave astronomy,
which increasingly incorporates deep learning techniques and algorithms. At the
same time, X-ray spectral data from NICER based on known pulsars are available,
and additional observations are expected from upcoming missions. In this study,
we revisit established universal relations, introduce new ones, and reassess
them using a feed-forward neural network as a regression model. More
specifically, we mainly propose ``deep'' EoS-insensitive hypersurface relations
for rapidly rotating compact objects between several of the star's global
parameters, which achieve an accuracy of within $1\%$ in most cases, with only
a small fraction of investigated models exceeding this threshold. While
analytical expressions can be used to represent some of these relations, the
neural network approach demonstrates superior performance, particularly in
complex regions of the parameter space. Furthermore, we use the SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to interpret the suggested network's
predictions, since is based on a strong theoretical framework inspired by the
field of cooperative Game Theory. Most importantly, these highly accurate
universal relations empowered with the interpretability description could be
used in efforts to constrain the high-density equation of state in neutron
stars, with the potential to enhance our understanding as new observables
emerge.

### [7] [Measurement of All Flavor PeV Neutrino Flux using Combined Datasets from IceCube](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05886)
*Emre Yildizci,Zoë Rechav,Lu Lu*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: IceCube Neutrino Observatory发现天体物理中微子谱与单幂律模型存在偏差，并通过神经网络事件选择和系统改进澄清了1 TeV至100 PeV能谱特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在澄清天体物理中微子谱的偏差特征，并改进大气中微子背景模型。

Method: 采用神经网络选择包含和非包含级联事件，结合系统改进和背景模型更新。

Result: 新方法有效面积提升约3倍，澄清了1 TeV至100 PeV能谱特征。

Conclusion: 通过改进的事件选择和背景模型，更清晰地揭示了天体物理中微子谱的偏差特征。

Abstract: Recently, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory has reported a deviation from the
single power law in the extragalactic diffuse neutrino flux. A neural
network-based event selection of contained and uncontained cascade events from
IceCube, in which uncontained events have interaction vertices at the edge or
outside of the detector instrumentation volume, has a factor ~3 gain in
effective area over the cascade events used in the novel combined tracks and
cascades selection which reported the deviation. Systematic improvements and
rigorously updated modeling of the atmospheric neutrino background is
incorporated into this high statistics contained and uncontained cascade event
selection to clarify features of the astrophysical neutrino spectrum across
energies from 1 TeV up to 100 PeV.

### [8] [Fast radio bursts by stellar wind microlensing of a faint background source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05947)
*Richard Lieu*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文研究了恒星等离子体对无线电信号的偏转效应，发现其偏转强度是引力偏转的5倍，并提出了新的强透镜方程。此外，还探讨了微透镜效应对快速射电暴（FRB）的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究恒星等离子体对无线电信号的偏转效应，以及这种效应对FRB观测的影响。

Method: 假设恒星等离子体密度遵循平方反比定律，推导出包含等离子体和引力效应的透镜方程，并分析其对FRB的观测影响。

Result: 等离子体偏转效应强于引力偏转，导致新的强透镜现象。微透镜效应可能每天产生约80个FRB，但对FRB分布的各向同性影响较小。重复FRB可能与双星系统的周期性遮挡有关。

Conclusion: 恒星等离子体对无线电信号的偏转效应显著，可能影响FRB的观测特征，但其对FRB分布的整体影响有限。

Abstract: By assuming the inverse square law of solar wind plasma density as
representative of other stars, it is shown that just outside a star the {\it
outward} deflection of a passing radio signal at $\nu\approx 1$~GHz (which is
capable of penetrating the plasma) is about 5 times larger than the
gravitational inward deflection by the star, and the ensuing lens equation
which takes both effects into account is a cubic polynomial with three roots
and a new strong lensing caustic. The geometric optics approach is valid for a
radio source size $\lesssim 1$~pc. Microlensing magnification of a steady
background source occurs typically over a timescale of milliseconds, resulting
in $\approx 80$ Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) per day over the whole sky, which can
only perturb the isotropy of FRB distribution at the several \% level.
Moreover, repeating FRBs could be triggered by the periodic interception of the
line-of-sight of the background source by members of a binary system. The
temporal signatures of such FRBs are consistent with the power spectrum of
solar wind density fluctuations on corresponding scales, except the mean
density of the wind is a few times higher than the solar value.

TL;DR: ARA实验利用第五个站点（A5）的混合探测能力，改进了低信噪比信号的检测，并展示了背景抑制和方向重建的进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升对超高能（UHE）中微子的探测能力，特别是低信噪比信号，以推动下一代冰中UHE中微子实验的发展。

Method: 利用A5站点的中央相控阵弦和干涉触发技术，结合混合探测器的数据选择和背景抑制方法。

Result: 显著提高了低信噪比信号的检测灵敏度，并改进了方向重建和背景抑制效果。

Conclusion: 该研究为下一代冰中UHE中微子实验奠定了基础，展示了混合探测器的潜力。

Abstract: The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) is an in-ice ultrahigh energy (UHE, >10 PeV)
neutrino experiment at the South Pole, designed to detect neutrino-induced
radio emission in ice. It consists of five independent stations, each featuring
a cubic lattice of in-ice antenna clusters spaced ~30 m apart and buried ~200 m
below the surface. The fifth ARA station (A5) is unique due to its central
phased array string, which employs an interferometric trigger to enhance
sensitivity to weak signals otherwise buried in noise. This low-threshold
trigger makes ARA the first in-ice radio neutrino experiment to demonstrate a
significant improvement in detecting low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) radio
signals.
  We present progress toward the first UHE neutrino search utilizing A5's
hybrid detection capability, incorporating advancements in data selection and
background rejection. This analysis is the first to fully apply dedicated event
selection to both components of ARA's hybrid detector, improving directional
reconstruction and significantly enhancing background rejection compared to
previous analyses. This approach paves the way for next-generation in-ice UHE
neutrino experiments.

### [10] [Illuminating Hidden Pulsars: Scintillation-Enhanced Discovery of Two Binary Millisecond Pulsars in M13 with FAST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05998)
*Dejiang Yin,Lin Wang,Li-yun Zhang,Lei Qian,Baoda Li,Kuo Liu,Bo Peng,Yinfeng Dai,Yaowei Li,Zhichen Pan*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 利用FAST望远镜对M13球状星团进行FFT加速搜索，发现两颗新的毫秒脉冲星M13G和M13H，其中M13G被确认为黑寡妇系统，M13H因检测率极低无法进一步分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过低检测阈值（2σ）提高对微弱脉冲星的灵敏度，探索球状星团中的脉冲星系统。

Method: 使用FFT技术对FAST的84次观测数据进行全长度和分段分析。

Result: 发现两颗毫秒脉冲星：M13G（黑寡妇系统，轨道周期0.12天）和M13H（检测率极低）。

Conclusion: M13G的系统特性被详细描述，而M13H需要更多观测以确定其轨道参数和分类。

Abstract: We conducted a sensitive acceleration search using Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) techniques on full-length and segmented data from 84 observations of the
globular cluster M13 with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio
Telescope (FAST). Employing a low detection threshold (2 $\sigma$) to maximize
sensitivity to faint pulsars, here we report the discovery of two binary
millisecond pulsars: J1641+3627G (M13G) and J1641+3627H (M13H). Both pulsars
were detected during scintillation-brightened states, revealing systems that
would otherwise remain undetected. For M13G, we obtained a phase-connected
timing solution spanning 6.4 years, identifying it as a black widow system with
an orbital period of 0.12 days hosting an extremely low-mass companion ($\sim
9.9\times 10^{-3}~{ M}_\odot$), though no eclipses were observed. M13H,
however, shows significant apparent acceleration but was detected in only 2 of
84 observations; its extremely low detection rate currently prevents
constraints on orbital parameters or classification.

*Muhammed Saleem,Hsin-Yu Chen,Daniel M. Siegel,Philippe Landry,Jocelyn S. Read,Kaile Wang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文探讨了中子星-黑洞合并和快速合并双中子星系统对银河系$r$-过程元素富集的贡献，发现它们无法作为主要补充来源，强调了非合并生产通道的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中子星合并已被确认为$r$-过程元素的主要来源，但银河系盘恒星的观测和化学演化模型表明需要其他补充通道。

Method: 结合LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA的引力波观测、短伽马射线暴数据、银河脉冲星及[Eu/Fe] vs [Fe/H]丰度观测，评估合并事件的贡献。

Result: 中子星-黑洞合并和快速合并双中子星系统无法作为主要补充通道，与现有观测和理论预期存在冲突。

Conclusion: 银河系$r$-过程元素的富集需要非合并生产通道的补充。

Abstract: Since the discovery of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 and its
associated kilonova, neutron star mergers have been established as a key
production channel for $r$-process elements in the Universe. However,
observations of $r$-process abundances as inferred from stellar spectra of
Milky Way disk stars, together with chemical evolution modeling, suggest that
additional channels are needed to fully account for the $r$-process element
enrichment in the Milky Way. Neutron star-black hole mergers and fast-merging
binary neutron star systems are among the leading alternative candidates. In
this study, we combine gravitational-wave observations from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA
with data from short gamma-ray bursts, Galactic pulsars, and Galactic [Eu/Fe]
vs [Fe/H] abundance observations to assess the contribution of these mergers to
$r$-process enrichment in the Galactic disk. We find that neither neutron
star-black hole mergers nor fast-merging binary neutron star populations can
serve as the dominant additional channel without generating strong tension with
existing observations and theoretical expectations. These results constrain the
viable sources of Galactic $r$-process enrichment and underscore the necessity
of non-merger production channels.

Abstract: Relativistic shocks are considered efficient accelerators of charged
particles and play crucial roles in high-energy astrophysical phenomena, such
as gamma-ray bursts and pulsar winds. This study focuses on positron
accelerations in magnetized relativistic shocks in electron-positron-ion
plasma. Employing one-dimensional ab initio particle-in-cell simulations, we
found a preferential positron acceleration through an interaction with the
wakefield associated with a precursor wave in the upstream region. Test
particle simulations revealed that the selective acceleration occurs for
sufficiently large amplitudes of the wakefield. The mechanism can be understood
as the relativistic $\boldsymbol{E}\times\boldsymbol{B}$ acceleration
formulated in the upstream frame. A theoretical analysis of the positron
acceleration in astrophysical contexts is presented, supporting
ultra-relativistic shocks in pulsar winds as a primary source for the
high-energy positron excess.

Motivation: 研究活动星系核喷流的物理特性，尤其是M87喷流的组成和结构，以验证理论模型与观测的一致性。

Method: 采用能量守恒假设建模喷流，结合VLBI观测和广义相对论磁流体力学模拟，计算喷流参数和辐射特性。

Conclusion: 通过ALMA和VLBI的联合观测，可以进一步验证喷流成分及其在中心区域的准直性。

Abstract: We analytically model stationary and axisymmetric active galactic nucleus
jets, assuming energy conservation along each magnetic flux tube. Using
very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations and published general
relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we constrain the evolution of the
bulk Lorentz factor, the magnetization parameter, and the magnetic field
strength along the jet. We then infer the electron density, emission
coefficient, and absorption coefficient at each point, and integrate the
radiative transfer equation to compute the spectral energy distribution (SED)
and the core shift of the synchrotron emission from the relativistic jet.
Applying the method to the M87 jet, we find that the hot plasmas are injected
at the altitude of seven Schwarzschild radii from the black hole (BH), that the
M87 jet is likely composed of a pair plasma, and that the jet flowline geometry
is quasi-parabolic as reported at much greater distances. Fitting the
nonthermal fraction of the leptonic jet as a function of position, we also find
that most of the radio photons are emitted within 1000 Schwarzschild radii from
the BH. Although hadronic jets do not reproduce all the VLBI observations
consistently in our model, we also discuss that their heavy mass allows a
stronger magnetic field within the observational constraints, leading to an
inverted SED in sub-millimeter wavelengths by the thermal emission from the jet
base. It is therefore implied that contemporaneous observations of the M87 jet
with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and VLBI could
discriminate the jet composition and its collimation within the central 100
Schwarzschild radii.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文研究了黑洞-中子星合并中低质量黑洞的电磁对应体，通过11次广义相对论流体动力学模拟，发现快速抛射物和螺旋波驱动抛射物，揭示了自旋增强的蓝色千新星发射机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GW230529的探测表明黑洞-中子星合并可能涉及低质量黑洞，并可能产生可探测的电磁对应体，这激发了研究团队对自旋效应的系统性研究。

Method: 研究团队进行了11次完全广义相对论流体动力学模拟，涵盖不同黑洞自旋值（从0.0到0.8），并首次在黑洞-中子星合并中识别螺旋波驱动抛射物。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了自旋增强的电磁对应体产生机制，扩展了可观测黑洞-中子星合并系统的范围。

Abstract: The recent detection of GW230529 suggests that black hole-neutron star
mergers may involve low-mass black holes, potentially producing detectable
electromagnetic counterparts. Motivated by this, we perform eleven fully
general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations with and without neutrino
treatment, targeting the inferred chirp mass of GW230529. We systematically
vary the black hole spin from $a_{\mathrm{BH}} = 0.0$ to $0.8$ in steps of
$0.1$, making this the most comprehensive study of spin effects in black
hole-neutron star mergers to date. We confirm our earlier findings of
fast-moving ejecta ($v \geq 0.6\,c$) in this parameter regime and demonstrate a
clear spin dependence, with fast-ejecta masses reaching up to $\qty{\sim
e-3}{\Mass\Sun}$ for $a_{\mathrm{BH}} = 0.8$. Most notably, we identify for the
first time the presence of spiral wave-driven ejecta in black hole-neutron star
mergers -- a phenomenon previously reported only in binary neutron star
systems. The mass of this component grows significantly with spin, reaching
levels up to $\qty{\sim 7e-3}{\Mass\Sun}$. These results establish a new
spin-enhanced mechanism for powering blue kilonova emission in black
hole-neutron star mergers, significantly extending the range of systems
expected to produce observable electromagnetic counterparts.

Abstract: Current and upcoming cosmological surveys will produce unprecedented amounts
of high-dimensional data, which require complex high-fidelity forward
simulations to accurately model both physical processes and systematic effects
which describe the data generation process. However, validating whether our
theoretical models accurately describe the observed datasets remains a
fundamental challenge. An additional complexity to this task comes from
choosing appropriate representations of the data which retain all the relevant
cosmological information, while reducing the dimensionality of the original
dataset. In this work we present a novel framework combining scale-dependent
neural summary statistics with normalizing flows to detect model
misspecification in cosmological simulations through Bayesian evidence
estimation. By conditioning our neural network models for data compression and
evidence estimation on the smoothing scale, we systematically identify where
theoretical models break down in a data-driven manner. We demonstrate a first
application to our approach using matter and gas density fields from three
CAMELS simulation suites with different subgrid physics implementations.

### [16] [Can dynamic dark energy explain the $S_8$ tension, the `lensing is low' effect, or strong baryon feedback?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05746)
*S. Heydenreich,A. Leauthaud,J. DeRose*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 研究动态暗能量对三个宇宙学异常（$S_8$张力、'透镜效应低'现象和强重子反馈）的影响，发现动态暗能量可能解释其中两个异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨动态暗能量宇宙学模型对当前宇宙学异常的解释能力，特别是与$\Lambda$CDM模型的对比。

Method: 分析动态暗能量对星系-星系透镜信号、宇宙剪切和热Sunyaev Zeldovich信号的影响，比较其与$\Lambda$CDM模型的差异。

Result: 动态暗能量使星系-星系透镜信号减少7%，宇宙剪切抑制14%，但热Sunyaev Zeldovich信号增加15%，不足以显著减少重子效应。

Conclusion: 动态暗能量可能解释部分宇宙学异常，透镜测量是约束低红移膨胀偏离$\Lambda$的有效方法。

Abstract: We investigate the impact of a DESI motivated dynamic dark energy cosmology
on three cosmological anomalies, the $S_8$ tension, the `lensing is low'
effect, and observations of strong baryonic feedback. We analyze how these
observations vary in $\Lambda$CDM versus dynamic dark energy. We find that the
galaxy-galaxy lensing signal is reduced by up to 7% with respect to galaxy
clustering and that cosmic shear is suppressed by 14%. These differences are
primarily caused by changes to cosmological distance measures which enter the
lensing efficiency kernels. In contrast, we find that dynamic dark energy
increases the thermal Sunyaev Zeldovich signal by about 15%, but that this is
insufficient to substantially reduce the magnitude of baryonic effects. Thus,
we find that dynamic dark energy may help explain two out of these three
cosmological anomalies. DESI's dynamic dark energy has an important impact on
cosmic expansion at $z\lesssim 0.5$, a regime where baryon acoustic
oscillations are limited by the small volume. Because lensing is sensitive to
distances, in addition to growth, we argue that lensing measurements are a
promising alternative to constrain expansion deviations from $\Lambda$ at low
redshifts.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 实现了两种PSO算法（全局最优和局部最优），用于探索暗能量模型，并基于DESI和DESI+Union3数据集进行分析。

Conclusion: PSO可作为MCMC的补充，加速数据分析过程。

Abstract: The search for the model or ingredients that describe the current vision of
our cosmos has led to the creation of a set of highly favorable experiments,
and therefore a great flow of information. Due to this torrent of information
and the need to analyze it exhaustively, the main aim of this paper is to
introduce the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as a complement to traditional
cosmological data analysis. The PSO is one of the most representative
Bio-inspired algorithms as provides excellent robustness in high-dimensional or
complex problems with relative simplicity and small number of parameters during
the implementation. In this work we implemented two versions of the canonical
PSO algorithm: global best and local best, to explore dark energy models in the
light of Type Ia Supernovae and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations observations, in
particular, DESI and DESI+Union3 datasets. The results achieved validate the
performance of the PSO algorithm in finding the best-fit parameters from
observational data and confirm that PSO, under certain conditions, can deliver
competitive results, at a fraction of time, compared to standard MCMC methods.
Finally, the PSO output can also serve as a valuable input to the MCMC methods
to speed up its analysis.

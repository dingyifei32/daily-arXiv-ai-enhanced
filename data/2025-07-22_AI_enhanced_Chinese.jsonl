We addressed the first\n  referee report", "summary": "We present the joint modelling of weak-lensing and count measurements of the\ngalaxy clusters detected with the AMICO code, in the fourth data release of the\nKilo Degree Survey (KiDS-1000). The analysed sample comprises about 8000\nclusters, covering an effective area of 839 deg$^{2}$ and extending up to a\nredshift of $z = 0.8$. Stacked cluster weak-lensing and count measurements have\nbeen derived in bins of redshift and intrinsic richness, $\\lambda^*$. Based on\nself-organising maps, we reconstructed the true redshift distributions of the\nbackground galaxy samples. We accounted for the systematic uncertainties\narising from impurities in the background and cluster samples, biases in the\ncluster $z$ and $\\lambda^*$, projection effects, halo orientation and\nmiscentring, truncation of cluster halo mass distributions, matter correlated\nwith cluster haloes, multiplicative shear bias, baryonic matter, geometric\ndistortions in the lensing profiles, uncertainties in the theoretical halo mass\nfunction, and super-sample covariance. We also employed a blinding strategy\nbased on perturbing the cluster sample completeness. The improved statistics\nand photometry compared to the previous KiDS data release, KiDS-DR3, have led\nto a halving of the uncertainties on $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ and $\\sigma_8$, as we\nobtained $\\Omega_{\\rm m}=0.22\\pm0.02$ and $\\sigma_8=0.86\\pm0.03$.

Galaxy clusters provide key insights into cosmic structure\nformation, galaxy formation and are essential for cosmological studies.

Each detection includes probabilistic membership assignments for\nthe KiDS-DR4 galaxies within the magnitude range 15<r'<24. Methods. Using the\nAdaptive Matched Identifier of Clustered Objects (AMICO) algorithm, we\nidentified 23965 clusters over an effective area of about 839 deg2 in the\nredshift range $0.1\\le z \\le0.9$, with a signal-to-noise ratio $S/N>3.5$. The\nsample is highly homogeneous across the entire survey thanks to the restrictive\ngalaxy selection criteria we adopted.

We introduced algorithmic enhancements to AMICO to mitigate\nborder effects among neighbor tiles. Quality flags are also provided for each\ncluster detection.

Submitted to JCAP", "summary": "The evolution of the supermassive Black Hole (BH) population across cosmic\ntimes remains a central unresolved issue in modern astrophysics, due to the\nmany noticeable uncertainties in the involved physical processes. Here we\ntackle the problem via a semi-empirical approach with minimal assumptions and\ndata-driven inputs. This is firmly grounded on a continuity plus Smoluchowski\nequation framework that allows to unitarily describe the two primary modes of\nBH growth: gas accretion and binary mergers. Key quantities related to the\nlatter processes are incorporated through educated parameterizations, and then\nconstrained in a Bayesian setup from joint observational estimates of the local\nBH mass function, of the large-scale BH clustering, and of the nano-Hz\nstochastic gravitational wave (GW) background measured from Pulsar Timimg Array\n(PTA) experiments. We find that the BH accretion-related parameters are\nstrongly dependent on the local BH mass function determination: higher\nnormalizations and flatter high-mass slopes in the latter imply lower radiative\nefficiencies and mean Eddington ratios with a stronger redshift evolution.\nAdditionally, the binary BH merger rate is estimated to be a fraction $\\lesssim\n10^{-1}$ of the galaxy merger rate derived from galaxy pairs counts by JWST,\nand constrained not to exceed the latter at $\\gtrsim 2\\sigma$. Relatedly, we\nhighlight hints of a possible tension between current constraints on BH\ndemographics and the interpretation of the nano-Hz GW background as\npredominantly caused by binary BH mergers. Specifically, we bound the latter's\ncontribution to $\\lesssim 30-50\\%$ at $\\sim 3\\sigma$, suggesting that either\nsystematics in the datasets considered here have been underestimated so far, or\nthat additional astrophysical/cosmological sources are needed to explain the\nresidual part of the signal measured by PTA experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff08BH\uff09\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6c14\u4f53\u5438\u79ef\u548c\u53cc\u661f\u5408\u5e76\u4e24\u79cd\u589e\u957f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6846\u67b6\u7ea6\u675f\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5438\u79ef\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u672c\u5730BH\u8d28\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9BH\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff08BH\uff09\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u662f\u73b0\u4ee3\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u8bb8\u591a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u534a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\u548cSmoluchowski\u65b9\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0BH\u7684\u6c14\u4f53\u5438\u79ef\u548c\u53cc\u661f\u5408\u5e76\u4e24\u79cd\u589e\u957f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ea6\u675f\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0BH\u5438\u79ef\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u672c\u5730BH\u8d28\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u53cc\u661fBH\u5408\u5e76\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8eJWST\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u5408\u5e76\u7387\uff1b\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u6e90\u53ef\u80fd\u5e76\u975e\u53cc\u661fBH\u5408\u5e76\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9BH\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u9700\u8003\u8651\u5176\u4ed6\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u6216\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6765\u6e90\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u5269\u4f59\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002"}}

We focus on the cases with bound post-explosion orbits, where the\nneutron star may periodically gravitationally capture gas from the companion.\nWe find that neutron star accretion must occur if the pre-supernova binary\nseparation is less than about 20 Rsun.

We then consider the\ninternal shocks formed between adjacent episodes of disk wind. The shocks\nefficiently convert the wind kinetic energy into radiation (due to\ninverse-Compton cooling), which heats up the supernova ejecta located at much\nlarger radii. The extra heating powers bright optical emission that is\nperiodically modulated on the orbital timescale. The shocks also accelerate\nnon-thermal particles which produce gamma-ray and neutrino emission from 100\nMeV to 10 PeV via hardronic pp collisions. The high-energy photons leak out of\nthe supernova ejecta after a delay of several months to one year.\nPhoto-ionization of the slowest parts of the disk wind produces hydrogen\nrecombination lines.

Indeed, a striking feature of the\nmultiple prompt outbursts is that the third occurs at an integer multiple of\nthe interval between the first two. Although not conclusive, this could be\nindicative of periodicity in the progenitor system. We discuss several possible\nscenarios to explain the exceptional properties of the burst, which suggest\nthat either a very unusual collapsar or the tidal disruption of a white dwarf\nby an intermediate-mass black hole are plausible explanations for this\nunprecedented GRB.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7f55\u89c1\u7684\u591a\u6b21\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u66b4GRB 250702BDE\uff0c\u5176\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u5bf9\u5e94\u4f53\u7b26\u5408\u6807\u51c6\u4f59\u8f89\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u7206\u53d1\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u574d\u7f29\u661f\u6216\u5408\u5e76\u9a71\u52a8\u7684GRB\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6697\u793a\u5468\u671f\u6027\u524d\u8eab\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76GRB 250702BDE\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8d39\u7c73\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u66b4\u76d1\u6d4b\u5668\u3001\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u63a2\u9488\u3001VLT\u3001MeerKAT\u548c\u54c8\u52c3\u592a\u7a7a\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0GRB 250702BDE\u5177\u6709\u6781\u7ea2\u7684\u7ea2\u5916\u5bf9\u5e94\u4f53\uff0c\u7206\u53d1\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u5df2\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6697\u793a\u5468\u671f\u6027\u524d\u8eab\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "GRB 250702BDE\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u975e\u5e38\u89c4\u574d\u7f29\u661f\u6216\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u88ab\u4e2d\u7b49\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6f6e\u6c50\u6495\u88c2\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002"}}

We consider that the total matter sector consists of\nthree independently evolving components, namely, radiation, baryons, and dark\nmatter, with the latter being governed by an adiabatic matter creation process\nthat leads to a modified continuity equation. Due to the violation of the\nstandard conservation law, a creation pressure appears, and under a proper\nchoice of dark-matter particle creation rate one can obtain the present\naccelerating phase as well as the past thermal history of the Universe. We\nstudy two specific matter creation rates. By applying the dynamical-system\nanalysis we show that both Model I and Model II can mimic a $\\Lambda$CDM-like\nbehavior.

The planar\nphase is unique to the unusual density profile of the He-detonated layer in\ncomparison to the steep profile at a stellar edge as is usually considered for\nshock breakout. The shock cooling emission can be modified by recombination,\nand we explore these effects.

For the parameters of these models we\nalso provide the combination of Euclid forecasts (pessimistic and optimistic)\nwith current and future measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nanisotropies., i.e. Planck, the Simons Observatory (SO), and CMB-S4. We provide\nFisher forecasts for how the power spectrum and bispectrum from the Euclid\nspectroscopic survey will constrain the local, equilateral, and orthogonal\nshapes of primordial non-Gaussianity. We also review how Bayesian field-level\ninference of primordial non-Gaussianity can constrain local primordial\nnon-Gaussianity. We show how Euclid, with its unique combination of the main\nprobes, will provide the tightest constraints on low redshift to date.

Accepted by ApJ", "summary": "We present a comprehensive analysis of 32 type II supernovae (SNe II) with\nplateau phase photometry and late phase ($nebular$) spectroscopy available,\naiming to bridge the gap between the surface and core of their red supergiant\n(RSG) progenitors. Using \\texttt{MESA}\\,+\\texttt{STELLA}, we compute an\nextensive grid of SN II light curve models originating from RSG with effective\ntemperatures $T_{\\rm eff}$ around 3650\\,K and hydrogen-rich envelopes\nartificially stripped to varying degrees. These models are then used to derive\nthe hydrogen-rich envelope masses $M_{\\rm Henv}$ for SNe II from their plateau\nphase light curves. Nebular spectroscopy further constrains the progenitor\nRSG's luminosity log\\,$L_{\\rm prog}$, and is employed to remove the\ndegeneracies in light curve modeling. The comparison between log\\,$L_{\\rm\nprog}$-$M_{\\rm Henv}$ reveals that $M_{\\rm Henv}$ spans a broad range at the\nsame log\\,$L_{\\rm prog}$, and almost all SNe II have lower $M_{\\rm Henv}$ than\nthe prediction of the default stellar wind models. We explore alternative wind\nprescriptions, binary evolution models, and the possibility of more compact RSG\nprogenitors. Although binary interaction offers a compelling explanation for\nthe non-monotonicity and large scatter in the log\\,$L_{\\rm prog}$-$M_{\\rm\nHenv}$ relation, the high occurrence rate of partially-stripped RSGs cannot be\naccounted for by stable binary mass transfer alone without fine-tuned orbital\nparameters. This highlights that, despite being the most commonly observed\nclass of core-collapse SNe, SNe II likely originate from a variety of mass-loss\nhistories and evolutionary pathways that are more diverse and complex than\ntypically assumed in standard stellar evolution models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e8632\u9897II\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\uff08SNe II\uff09\u7684\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u7ea2\u8d85\u5de8\u661f\uff08RSG\uff09\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u7684\u8868\u9762\u4e0e\u6838\u5fc3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6c22\u5305\u5c42\u8d28\u91cf\uff08M_Henv\uff09\u4e0eRSG\u5149\u5ea6\uff08log L_prog\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u548c\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u6563\u5c04\uff0c\u8868\u660eSNe II\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u6052\u661f\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u7ea2\u8d85\u5de8\u661f\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u8868\u9762\u4e0e\u6838\u5fc3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22SNe II\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528MESA+STELLA\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86RSG\u8d77\u6e90\u7684SN II\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u5bfc\u6c22\u5305\u5c42\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6c22\u5305\u5c42\u8d28\u91cf\u5728\u76f8\u540cRSG\u5149\u5ea6\u4e0b\u53d8\u5316\u8303\u56f4\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709SNe II\u7684\u6c22\u5305\u5c42\u8d28\u91cf\u4f4e\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u6052\u661f\u98ce\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "SNe II\u53ef\u80fd\u8d77\u6e90\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u8d28\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5176\u590d\u6742\u6027\u8fdc\u8d85\u6807\u51c6\u6052\u661f\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}

Our capability of discovering pulsations in ULXs is limited, among\nothers, by poor statistics. However, catalogues and archives of high-energy\nmissions contain information which can be used to identify new candidate\npulsating ULXs (PULXs). The goal of this research is to single out candidate\nPULXs among those ULXs which have not shown pulsations due to an unfavourable\ncombination of factors. We applied an AI approach to an updated database of\nULXs detected by XMM-Newton. We first used an unsupervised clustering algorithm\nto sort out sources with similar characteristics into two clusters. Then, the\nsample of known PULX observations has been used to set the separation threshold\nbetween the two clusters and to identify the one containing the new candidate\nPULXs. We found that only a few criteria are needed to assign the membership of\nan observation to one of the two clusters. The cluster of new candidate PULXs\ncounts 85 unique sources for 355 observations, with $\\sim$85% of these new\ncandidates having multiple observations.

Previously, we\ndeveloped a numerical code jetsimpy, to model the afterglow of jets with\narbitrary angular profiles. In this study, we extend the code to incorporate a\nstratified radial profile, enabling it to model jets with arbitrary\naxisymmetric two-dimensional structures. The radial profile leads to the\nformation of a reverse shock. We modeled the shock system using an energy\nconservation prescription, which differs from the pressure balance approach.\nThis leads to remarkably different predictions for reverse shock emission. In\nparticular, we find that the reverse shock emission in the thin shell case is\nsignificantly overestimated in analytic models. We also explore the off-axis\nreverse shock emission from structured jets, where the cores belong to thick\nshell cases and the wings belong to thin shell cases. We have confirmed the\nprediction that off-axis observers may see a thin-to-thick transition, but we\nfind that the light curve morphology is hard to distinguish from pure thin or\nthick shell cases. A radial profile also introduces hydrodynamic energy\ninjection. As such, our code can naturally apply to refreshed shock cases,\nwhere the modeling of kilonova afterglows is demonstrated as an example. To\nvalidate our method, we fit the optical flash of GRB 990123, showing good\nagreement with the data.

Their phenomenology does not fit\nexactly in any other class, although it might resemble that of radio magnetars\nor of white dwarf (WD) radio emitting binary systems. Notably, two LPTs with\nconfirmed multi-wavelength counterparts have been identified as synchronised\nwhite dwarf-M dwarf binaries (polars). Meanwhile, systems such as AR Scorpii\nand J1912-44 exhibit short-period pulsations in a hr-tight orbit, with\npolarized radio emission proposed to be generated by the interaction of the WD\nmagnetosphere with the low-mass companion wind.\n  Here we demonstrate that both LPTs and WD binary pulsars can be explained\nwithin a single geometric model in which radio emission is triggered when the\nmagnetic pole of a rotating white dwarf intersects its companion's wind in the\nbinary orbital plane. We use a 36-year timing baseline to infer the orbital\nperiod and binary geometry solely from radio data of GPM J1839-10, the\nlongest-active LPT known. The model naturally predicts its intermittent\nemission and double-pulse structure. Crucially, we show that the beat period\nbetween the spin and the orbit matches the observed pulse substructure and\npolarisation signatures, providing strong support for the model.

This advancement lends itself to the birth\nof a number of contemporary techniques to study Galactic compact objects,\nincluding X-ray polarimetry-timing, the study of how polarisation properties\nevolve over short timescales. However, the statistical nature of polarisation\nmeasurements poses a challenge for studies on arbitrarily short timescales, as\na large number of photons are required to achieve statistically significant\nmeasurements of polarisation degree and angle for time-resolved analyses.\nFurthermore, if the polarisation variability is stochastic, then phase-folding\ntechniques introduce systematic errors in the phase assignment of photons.\nIngram and Maccarone presented a model independent Fourier-based technique that\ncircumvents these issues. It can be used on arbitrarily short timescales for\nany kind of variability, whether aperiodic, quasi-periodic or purely periodic.\nHere we implement this method on real IXPE data.

However,\nmodeling the pair cascades in the polar cap region poses significant\nchallenges, particularly under conditions of high plasma multiplicity.\nTraditional Particle-in-Cell (PIC) methods often face rapidly increasing\ncomputational costs as the multiplicity grows exponentially. To address this\nissue, we present a new simulation code using the Vlasov method, which\nefficiently simulates the evolution of charged particle distribution functions\nin phase space without a proportional increase in computational expense at high\nmultiplicities. We apply this code to study $e^\\pm$ pair cascades in 1D,\nincorporating key physical processes such as curvature radiation, radiative\ncooling, and magnetic pair production. We study both the Ruderman-Sutherland\n(RS) and the Space-charge-limited Flow (SCLF) regimes, and find quasiperiodic\ngap formation and pair production bursts in both cases. These features produce\nstrong electric field oscillations, potentially enabling coherent low-frequency\nradio emission. We construct a unified analytic model that describes the key\nfeatures of the polar cap cascade, which can be used to estimate the return\ncurrent heating rate that can be used to inform X-ray hotspot models. Spectral\nanalysis shows that a significant amount of energy is carried in superluminal\nmodes -- collective excitations that could connect to observed radio features.\nOur results align with previous PIC studies while offering enhanced fidelity in\nboth dense and rarefied regions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eVlasov\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u65b0\u6a21\u62df\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u6781\u51a0\u533a\u7684\u7535\u5b50-\u6b63\u7535\u5b50\u5bf9\u7ea7\u8054\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u6027\u95f4\u9699\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u5bf9\u4ea7\u751f\u7206\u53d1\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u76f8\u5e72\u4f4e\u9891\u5c04\u7535\u8f90\u5c04\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u6781\u51a0\u533a\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08QED\uff09\u5bf9\u7ea7\u8054\u5fae\u7269\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u5c04\u7535\u6ce2\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfPIC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Vlasov\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5e26\u7535\u7c92\u5b50\u5206\u5e03\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u66f2\u7387\u8f90\u5c04\u3001\u8f90\u5c04\u51b7\u5374\u548c\u78c1\u5bf9\u4ea7\u751f\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Ruderman-Sutherland\uff08RS\uff09\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7535\u8377\u9650\u5236\u6d41\uff08SCLF\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u6027\u95f4\u9699\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u5bf9\u4ea7\u751f\u7206\u53d1\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u5f3a\u7535\u573a\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u76f8\u5e72\u4f4e\u9891\u5c04\u7535\u8f90\u5c04\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u7b97X\u5c04\u7ebf\u70ed\u70b9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fd4\u56de\u7535\u6d41\u52a0\u70ed\u7387\uff1b\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u91cf\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u8d85\u5149\u901f\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0ePIC\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u5c04\u7535\u8f90\u5c04\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

### [1] [Can stellar physics explain GW231123?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10088)
*Djuna Croon,Jeremy Sakstein,Davide Gerosa*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文研究了引力波事件GW231123中两个黑洞的质量和自旋特性，特别是主黑洞的极端质量和快速自旋，探讨其是否可能通过单颗旋转大质量恒星坍缩形成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GW231123事件中的黑洞质量和自旋超出恒星演化理论预测的“对不稳定性质量间隙”，尤其是主黑洞的极端特性引发对其天体物理起源的疑问。

Method: 通过模拟初始核心质量为160太阳质量的恒星在不同旋转速率和核反应速率下的演化，研究黑洞的形成机制。

Result: 旋转将质量间隙推向更高质量，且质量≥150太阳质量的高自旋黑洞可以在质量间隙之上形成，表明恒星演化足以解释GW231123。

Conclusion: GW231123的主黑洞可能是首个直接观测到的通过光解不稳定性直接核心坍缩形成的黑洞。

Abstract: The gravitational wave event GW231123 detected by the LIGO interferometers
during their fourth observing run features two black holes with source-frame
masses of $137^{+22}_{-17} M_\odot$ and $103^{+20}_{-52} M_\odot $ -- well
within or above the pair-instability black hole mass gap predicted by standard
stellar evolution theory. Both black holes are also inferred to be rapidly
spinning ($\chi_1 \simeq 0.9$, $\chi_2 \simeq 0.8$). The primary object in
GW231123 is the heaviest stellar mass black hole detected to date, which,
together with its extreme rotation, raises questions about its astrophysical
origin. Accounting for the unusually large spin of $\sim 0.9$ with hierarchical
mergers requires some degree of fine tuning. We investigate whether such a
massive, highly spinning object could plausibly form from the collapse of a
single rotating massive star. We simulate stars with an initial core mass of
$160 \rm M_\odot$ -- sufficient to produce BH masses at the upper edge of the
90% credible interval for $m_1$ in GW231123 -- across a range of rotation rates
and $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rates. We find
that: (i) rotation shifts the pair-instability mass gap to higher masses,
introducing a significant ingredient that correlates masses and spins in
gravitational wave predictions; and (ii) highly spinning BHs with masses
$\gtrsim 150 \rm M_\odot$ can form above the mass gap, implying that stellar
evolution alone is sufficient to explain GW231123. Our results suggest that the
primary object of GW231123 may be the first directly observed black hole that
formed via direct core collapse following the photodisintegration instability.

### [2] [The X-ray Source Population of the Metal-Rich Globular Cluster NGC 6528](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10105)
*Bernard Leal,Kwangmin Oh,Jay Strader,Steve E. Zepf,Kristen Dage,S. Kim,C. Y. Hui*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究首次分析了银河系中金属丰度最高的球状星团NGC 6528的X射线源，发现18个源，并对其进行了分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索高金属丰度球状星团中X射线源的性质及其与星团动力学演化的关系。

Method: 利用钱德拉X射线天文台的66 ksec深度观测数据，结合哈勃太空望远镜的光度测量，对X射线源进行分类。

Result: 发现18个X射线源，光度范围在$10^{31}$-$10^{32}$erg s$^{-1}$，主要为激变变星和活动双星，可能包含一个休眠的低质量X射线双星。

Conclusion: 高金属丰度对X射线双星的增强效应被星团的高级动力学演化所抵消，导致X射线源数量相对较少。

Abstract: We present the first study of the X-ray sources in one of the most metal-rich
globular clusters in the Galaxy, NGC 6528. Using relatively deep (66 ksec)
archival imaging from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we identify 18 sources
within the half-light radius of the cluster, all in the range $L_X \sim
10^{31}$-$10^{32}$erg s$^{-1}$ (0.5-7 keV). By combining these data with
photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope and other sources, we classify the
X-ray sources as a likely mix of cataclysmic variables and active binaries,
though one or more of the brighter objects could be a quiescent low-mass X-ray
binary. For this cluster, it appears that the X-ray binary-enhancing effects of
high metallicity are outweighed by the cluster's advanced dynamical evolution,
leading to a relatively modest X-ray source population.

Conclusion: 多信使数据的结合有助于更精确地测量中微子通量和谱形，并推动理论模型的完善。

Abstract: Multi-messenger astronomy offers a powerful approach to studying high-energy
radiative processes in astrophysical sources. A notable example was seen in
2017, when the IceCube Neutrino Observatory detected a high-energy neutrino
event that was found to coincide with a gamma-ray flare from a blazar. Since
then, numerous multi-messenger studies combining neutrino and photon data have
been conducted, yet the origin of neutrinos from active galactic nuclei (AGN)
remains uncertain. In this work, we present the results of an X-ray observing
program targeting two AGNs, NGC 1068 and PKS 1502+106. The multi-wavelength
dataset includes new observations from NICER and NuSTAR from the observing
proposal along with gamma-ray data collected using Fermi-LAT, and one archival
observation from Chandra. Additionally, we derive the neutrino fluxes for both
AGNs using ten years of IceCube data and neutrino spectra predicted by
theoretical models. These results demonstrate the value of combining
multi-messenger data in building and constraining theoretical models. They also
highlight the importance of testing model predictions against observational
data to refine measurements of both the neutrino flux and spectral shape.

TL;DR: 该论文通过对南半球低频率（154 MHz）的MSP（毫秒脉冲星）普查，发现了40颗MSP，其中11颗是首次在300 MHz以下被探测到，并提供了偏振和法拉第旋转测量结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究低频率下MSP的辐射特性和星际介质对信号的影响，填补南半球低频率MSP观测的空白。

Method: 使用SMART脉冲星调查，覆盖南纬+30度以下的区域，进行154 MHz的观测，检测MSP并分析其偏振和法拉第旋转。

Result: 发现40颗MSP，其中11颗为新探测；25颗MSP的法拉第旋转显著；脉冲轮廓在低频率下偏振度更高。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来低频率MSP监测和SKA-Low的MSP探测提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Observations of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) at low radio frequencies play an
important role in understanding the Galactic pulsar population and
characterising both their emission properties and the effects of the ionised
interstellar medium on the received signals. To date, only a relatively small
fraction of the known MSP population has been detected at frequencies below 300
MHz, and nearly all previous MSP studies at these frequencies have been
conducted with northern telescopes. We present a census of MSPs in the SMART
pulsar survey, covering declinations south of +30 deg at a centre frequency of
154 MHz. We detected 40 MSPs, with 11 being the first published detections
below 300 MHz. For each detection, we provide coherently-dedispersed
full-polarimetric integrated pulse profiles and mean flux densities. We
measured significant Faraday rotation measures (RMs) for 25 MSPs, and
identified apparent phase-dependent RM variations for three MSPs. Comparison
with published profiles at other frequencies supports previous studies
suggesting that the pulse component separations of MSPs vary negligibly over a
wide frequency range due to their compact magnetospheres. We observe that
integrated pulse profiles tend to be more polarised at low frequencies,
consistent with depolarisation due to superposed orthogonal polarisation modes.
The results of this census will be a valuable resource for planning future MSP
monitoring projects at low frequencies, and will also help to improve survey
simulations to forecast the detectable MSP population with the SKA-Low.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 通过数值模拟研究了吸积中子星在X射线双星中的中微子发射特性，发现高光度条件下可产生强中微子信号，并提出了未来观测的新基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索吸积中子星在X射线双星中产生中微子的机制及其可探测性，为未来中微子观测提供理论支持。

Method: 基于数值模拟，模拟了磁化中子星磁层中质子碰撞产生中微子的过程。

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来中微子观测提供了新基准，对当前和未来仪器的数据解释具有重要意义。

Abstract: We explored the expected properties of the neutrino emission from accreting
neutron stars in X-ray binaries using numerical simulations. The simulations
are based on a model in which neutrinos are produced by the decay of charged
pions and kaons, generated in inelastic collisions between protons accelerated
up to TeV energies in the magnetosphere of a magnetized (B~1E12 G) neutron star
and protons of the accretion disc. Our results show that this process can
produce strong neutrino emission up to a few tens of TeV when the X-ray
luminosity is above ~1E39 erg/s, as in ultra-luminous X-ray (ULX) pulsars. We
show that neutrinos from a transient Galactic ULX pulsar with L_x ~ 5E39 erg/s
can be detected with kilometre-scale detectors such as IceCube if the source is
within about 3-4 kpc. We also derived an upper limit on the neutrino flux from
the Galactic ULX pulsar Swift J0243.6+6124 using IceCube data, a result that
has not been previously reported. Our findings establish a new benchmark for
future astrophysical neutrino observations, critical for interpreting data from
current and upcoming instruments with significantly improved sensitivity.

### [6] [Tracing the Physical Lineage of GRB 211211A: Population Constraints on NS-WD Merger Gamma-Ray Bursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10551)
*Xiao-Tian Xu,Bin-Bin Zhang,Yun-Lang Guo,Xiang-Dong Li*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: GRB 211211A的异常特征表明其可能源于WD-NS双星合并，而非传统的大质量恒星坍缩。通过演化分析，发现理论预测的NS-WD/NS-NS比例远高于观测值，暗示可能存在未识别的类似事件或NS的非常规起源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GRB 211211A的起源及其与WD-NS双星合并的关系，以理解其罕见性及与观测数据的差异。

Method: 基于双星演化物理的定性分析，计算NS-WD/NS-NS的比例，并与观测数据对比。

Result: 理论预测的NS-WD/NS-NS比例为14-37%，远高于观测到的5%，表明可能存在未识别的类似事件或NS的非常规起源。

Conclusion: GRB 211211A的起源可能与WD-NS双星合并有关，但理论与观测的差异暗示了更多未知事件或NS的特殊形成机制。

Abstract: The peculiar long gamma-ray burst (GRB) event, GRB 211211A, is known for it
is association with a kilonova feature. Whereas most long GRBs are thought to
originate in the core collapse of massive stars, the presence of kilonova
suggests GRB 211211A was instead produced by a merger of a compact object
binary. Building on the interpretation put forward by
\citet{Yang2022Natur.612..232Y}--who argue that GRB 211211A was powered by a
massive white-dwarf + neutron-star (WD-NS) merger--we adopt this WD-NS scenario
as our observationally supported starting point. If the burst truly originates
from that channel, its rarity must mirror the formation and merger rate of
WD-NS binaries--a rate still largely unexplored in conventional massive-binary
population studies. In this letter, we present a qualitative analysis based on
binary evolution physics in order to understand the fraction of GRB 211211A in
short GRBs (NS-WD/NS-NS fraction). Since the progenitors of massive WD-NS
binaries occupy the initial mass function-preferred regime, where the zero-age
main-sequence mass range of the assumed WD mass range (1.2-1.4$\,M_\odot$) is
comparable to that of NSs, the NS-WD/NS-NS fraction emerging from our standard
evolutionary path is expected to be $\sim$14--37\%, far higher than the
observed fraction ($\sim5$\%). This discrepancy might imply a large,
still-unidentified population of GRB 211211A-like events or an unusual origin
of the NS-such as being hypernova-born or accretion-induced-collapse-born.
Placing these results in a broader compact-binary context, implications for
black-hole systems are also discussed.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 对1977年发现的Wow!信号进行了最新分析，修正了其参数，缩小了潜在来源范围，并支持其天体物理起源的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wow!信号是1977年发现的未解之谜，过去的数据限制了进一步研究。本文通过分析未公开的观测数据，试图重新评估其性质并解释其来源。

Method: 检索并分析了几十年来未公开的俄亥俄州SETI观测数据，采用现代方法重新评估Wow!信号的参数。

Result: 修正了信号的参数，缩小了潜在来源范围至两个相邻区域，测量了更高的峰值通量密度和频率，支持天体物理起源的假设。

Conclusion: 研究提供了Wow!信号最精确的参数约束，为识别其来源提供了新路径，并支持其可能源于小型冷HI云的假设。

Abstract: The Wow! Signal, detected in 1977 by the Ohio State University SETI project,
remains one of the most intriguing unexplained radio transients. The most
recent significant revision of its properties took place in the late 1990s;
however, further advances were limited by readily available data from this
event. Here we retrieved and analyzed decades of previously unpublished Ohio
SETI observations, enabling the most comprehensive re-evaluation of the
properties of the Wow! Signal to date with modern methods. Our results reveal
significant revisions to its parameters that may help explain why its source
has been so difficult to identify. We refine its potential origin to two
adjacent fields centered on the right ascension $\alpha=19^{\mathrm
h}25^{\mathrm m}02^{\mathrm s} \pm 3^{\mathrm s}$ or $19^{\mathrm h}27^{\mathrm
m}55^{\mathrm s} \pm 3^{\mathrm s}$, and the declination $\delta=-26^{\deg}57'
\pm 20'$ (J2000), a location both narrower and slightly displaced from earlier
estimates. We measure a higher peak flux density exceeding 250 Jy and a
frequency of $1420.726 \pm 0.005$ MHz, implying a galactic source with a
substantially higher radial velocity than previously assumed. Our analysis
provides additional support for the hypothesis that the Wow! Signal most likely
had an astrophysical origin rather than being attributed to radio interference.
In particular, we confirm that small, cold HI clouds can produce narrowband
signals similar to its detection, which might suggest a common origin. These
findings provide the most precise constraints to date on the location,
intensity, and frequency of the Wow! Signal and offer a new path to identify
its origin.

Abstract: In this paper we investigate quark deconfinement in neutrons stars and their
mergers, focusing on the effects of higher orders for the phase transition
between hadronic and quark matter. The different descriptions we use to
describe matter microscopically contain varying particle degrees of freedom,
including nucleons, hyperons, Delta baryons, and light and strange quarks. We
use tabulated equations of state from the CompOSE database in which the quark
deconfinement phase transition is described as being first-order, and then
smooth it out by introducing a percolation, replacing the single first-order
phase transition with two transitions of second or third order. We then perform
binary neutron-star merger simulations using these new equations of st ate,
focusing on groups of binaries with the same single-star mass, radius, and
tidal deformability, but different equations of state. We go on to discuss
differences in their evolution, and the ramifications for interpreting future
gravitational wave observations and the potential to learn about dense matter.

Abstract: Type-Ia supernovae (SNe), or runaway thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs
(WDs), play a critical role in the chemical evolution of galaxies, and are
important cosmological distance indicators due to their 'standardizable'
lightcurves. Growing evidence, however, suggests greater diversity in their
observed lightcurves (and spectra) than thought previously. This is usually
attributed to a variety of WD explosion mechanisms and progenitor system
properties, but a direct link between the explosion mechanisms and Type-Ia SN
observables remains elusive. Here we present a novel approach to identify
explosion mechanisms of Type-Ia SNe, by analyzing the sizes of small-scale
turbulent substructures of different elements in their extended ejecta, i.e.,
in Supernova Remnants (SNRs). Our three-dimensional hydrodynamical models show
that substructures in an SNR dominated by iron-group elements may have a
typical size different from substructures dominated by intermediate mass
elements (e.g., Si, S) in the same SNR. This size difference is governed by the
explosion mechanism. Applying this approach to Tycho's SNR, we find that its
observed structure is most consistent with the explosion of a sub-Chandrasekhar
mass WD via the double-detonation mechanism. Extending this method to other
well-characterized SNRs can let us connect the inferred explosion mechanism to
the associated historical SNe, which often have spectra reconstructed through
light echo observations.

Abstract: Magnetic reconnection drives a wide range of astrophysical phenomena,
including geomagnetic storms, solar flares, and activity in blazars. However,
direct measurement of key reconnection observables remains challenging due to
the remote and extreme nature of these environments. While high-energy particle
showers observed on Earth are often attributed to reconnection, the underlying
mechanisms are not fully understood, and clear diagnostic signatures are
lacking. We present a theoretical, data-driven approach for identifying
reconnection radiation signatures and enabling remote diagnostics of
reconnection in astrophysical settings through radiation spectra. Using
particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of magnetic reconnection, we generate
radiation spectra and establish connections between spectral features and the
underlying reconnection dynamics. We develop a method to estimate the ratio of
the reconnection electric field to the plasmoid magnetic field from spectral
data. Analytic calculations show that other parameters can be extracted in the
ultra-relativistic reconnection regime, such as the magnetic field or the
current sheet width.

Comments welcome!", "summary": "Simulation-based inference (SBI) allows fast Bayesian inference for\nsimulators encoding implicit likelihoods. However, some explicit likelihoods\ncannot be easily reformulated as simulators, hindering their integration into\ncombined analyses within SBI frameworks. One key example in cosmology is given\nby the Planck CMB likelihoods. We present a simple method to construct an\neffective simulator for any explicit likelihood using samples from a previously\nconverged Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) run. This effective simulator can\nsubsequently be combined with any forward simulator. To illustrate this method,\nwe combine the full Planck CMB likelihoods with a 3x2pt simulator (cosmic\nshear, galaxy clustering and their cross-correlation) for a Stage IV survey\nlike Euclid, and test evolving dark energy parameterized by the $w_0w_a$\nequation-of-state. Assuming the $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology hinted by DESI BAO DR2 +\nPlanck 2018 + PantheonPlus SNIa datasets, we find that future 3x2pt data alone\ncould detect evolving dark energy at $5\\sigma$, while its combination with\ncurrent CMB, BAO and SNIa datasets could raise the detection to almost\n$7\\sigma$. Moreover, thanks to simulation reuse enabled by SBI, we show that\nour joint analysis is in excellent agreement with MCMC while requiring zero\nBoltzmann solver calls. This result opens up the possibility of performing\nmassive global scans combining explicit and implicit likelihoods in a highly\nefficient way."}

By combining these new data with archival observations,\nwe confirm previous suggestions of orbital variability in the source's X-ray\nspectrum, including increased X-ray absorption at the orbital phase interval of\n$\\phi\\approx0.3\\textrm{--}0.4$. The source's X-ray flux within this phase\ninterval seems to have exhibited a significant change on an orbital timescale.\nAdditionally, occasional short-term variations in the X-ray band on a timescale\nof less than 3 days have been observed. The measured duration of the increased\nabsorbing column density and the flux variability timescales can provide clues\nabout the interaction between the putative pulsar and the Be companion's disk\nif, as previously suggested, the pulsar crosses the disk at this phase\ninterval. Moreover, the new contemporaneous X-ray and TeV observations around\nthe pulsar-crossing phases revealed independent variability in the X-ray and\nTeV fluxes, contrary to a previous observation of concurrent flux increases.\nWhile these observations alone cannot provide definitive conclusions, we\ndiscuss our results in the context of pulsar-disk interaction and intrabinary\nshock emission scenarios."}

This is true, in\nparticular, for stellar-mass black hole sources observed in the\nthermally-dominated state, for which the polarization signal is expected to\ndepend on the accretion disk inclination and the black hole spin. Two main\neffects determine the polarization properties of the accretion disk emission:\nthe absorption and scattering processes occurring before the radiation leaves\nthe disk atmosphere, and the relativistic effects influencing its propagation\ntowards the observer at infinity. In this work, we investigate these effects\ntogether considering only the contribution of direct radiation. We analyze how\nthe ionization state of the disk atmosphere, approximated with a\nconstant-density surface layer assumed to be either in collisional ionization\nequilibrium or photoionization equilibrium, can influence the\nspectro-polarimetric properties of the radiation at the emitting disk surface.\nSubsequently we study how these are modified by the propagation in a strong\ngravitational field."}

This has significant implications for source\nidentification, as the deflections of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) are\nlarger for heavy primaries than for lighter ones at the same energy. In this\nwork, we assume that cosmic rays above 40 EeV consist of iron nuclei only and\ninvestigate their possible sources through simulations of cosmic ray\npropagation, including interactions with ambient photon fields and deflections\nin the GMF using multiple models. We consider two types of sources as potential\norigins of these cosmic rays, active galactic nuclei and starburst galaxies. We\ncompare the predicted distributions of arrival directions from sources within\n250 Mpc with the measured arrival directions of cosmic rays above 40 EeV. Our\nresults indicate that stronger correlation is found for the active galactic\nnuclei scenario compared to starburst galaxies. However, we find that within\nour heavy mass composition model, the GMF leads to significant deflections,\nmaking source identification challenging with current knowledge and tools, even\nat the highest energies."}

We present a data-driven interpretation of UHECRs, the heavy-metal\nscenario, which assumes pure iron nuclei above $10^{19.6}$ eV ($\\approx 40$\nEeV) as the heaviest observed mass composition and introduces a global shift in\nthe $X_{\\rm{max}}$ scale predicted by the two hadronic interaction models\nQGSJet II-04 and Sibyll 2.3d. We investigate the consequences of the proposed\nmass-composition model based on the obtained shifts in the $X_{\\rm{max}}$\nvalues, which naturally lead to a heavier mass composition of UHECRs than\nconventionally assumed.

Within these systems, it may reflect from optically thick\nmatter, which will create characteristic observable X-ray spectro-polarimetric\nfeatures. We compute rest-frame reflection spectra and the corresponding\nenergy-dependent linear polarization degree and angle for (un)polarized\nsingle-temperature black-body spectra impinging on a partially ionized\nconstant-density optically thick slab. We use a combination of a Monte Carlo\nsimulation that takes into account scattering, absorption, and spectral lines,\nwith a non-LTE radiative transfer pre-computation of the ionization structure\nof the slab in photo-ionization equilibrium. We discuss the impact of the\nreflector's ionization and of the incident spectral shape on the obtained\nenergy dependence of polarization. Despite the presence of highly polarized\nabsorption features and low-polarized spectral lines, an underlying\nscattering-induced increase of polarization degree with energy in mid to hard\nX-rays naturally arises due to multiple Compton-scattering energy shifts. Such\nre-processing effect is particularly apparent in 2-8 keV for steep incident\nX-ray spectra reflecting from highly-ionized optically thick media. Integration\nof the resulting local reflection tables in specific large-scale reflection\ngeometries occurring in X-ray binary systems, including relativistic effects,\nwill be presented in a follow-up paper. Nonetheless, we anticipate that the\nobtained local energy-dependent features will imprint at large distances from\nthe source to the observed X-ray polarization, and could contribute to the\nobserved increase of total polarization degree with energy in 2-8 keV in many\naccreting systems by the IXPE mission."}

Due to Pauli blocking as electrons become degenerate at sufficiently\nhigh accretion rates $\\dot{M}$, the resulting 'self-neutronization' of the\ndissociated accreting plasma makes these astrophysical systems promising\nsources of rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis (the r-process). We present a\none-dimensional general-relativistic, viscous-hydrodynamic model of\nneutrino-cooled accretion disks around black holes. With collapsars,\nsuper-collapsars and very massive star collapse in mind, we chart the\ncomposition of the accretion flow and systematically explore different\nradiatively efficient and inefficient accretion regimes with increasing $\\dot\nM$, across a vast parameter space of $\\dot{M}\\sim 10^{-6}-10^6 M_\\odot\n\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, black hole masses of $M_\\bullet\\sim 1 - 10^4 M_\\odot$ and\ndimensionless spins of $\\chi_\\bullet \\in [0,1)$, as well as $\\alpha$-viscosity\nvalues of $\\alpha\\sim 10^{-3}-1$.

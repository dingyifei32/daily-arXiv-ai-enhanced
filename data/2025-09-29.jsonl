By utilizing datasets from the Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB), Pantheon + Analysis, Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Baryon Acoustic\nOscillations (BAO), and CMB Lensing, we explore the interplay between\ncosmological parameters and observational constraints. The model effectively\nreduces the Hubble tension, achieving a consistency in $H_0$ measurements of\n$1.37\\sigma$ and $1.24\\sigma$ for the CMB + ALL dataset For Planck 2018 and R22\nrespectively. Additionally, the study refines constraints on the total mass of\nneutrinos ($\\Sigma_{m_{\\nu}}$), with a finding of $0.115\\,\\text{eV}$ for the\nCMB + ALL dataset. The analysis examines the effective equation of state\nparameter ($w_{\\text{eff}}$), indicating a transition towards a universe\ndominated by exotic energy forms. The combined datasets refine $w_{\\text{eff}}$\nto $-1.02\\pm0.018$, underscoring the importance of multi-dataset integration in\nunderstanding dark energy dynamics. Furthermore, the interaction constant\n$\\beta$ between the quintom scalar field and neutrinos is constrained to $0.65\n\\pm 0.12$ for the CMB + ALL dataset. The potential parameters $\\lambda_{\\sigma}\n= -2.09 \\pm 0.082$ and $\\lambda_{\\phi} = 2.43 \\pm 0.12$ are also determined,\nproviding insights into the quintom model's implications for cosmological\ndynamics.

This\ncocoon expands within the stellar envelope and eventually breaks out as a\nmildly relativistic outflow. We investigate the plasma physics in the\nsurroundings of massive collapsing stars harboring choked jets via\nrelativistic, non-resistive MHD simulations. As a result, we define the\nparameter space allowing for jets to remain choked, and we quantify the\nacceleration rate and efficiency for charged particles in the strong shocks of\nsuch astrophysical environments. Preliminary results show that high Mach\nnumbers ($\\sim 100$) after 5-10 seconds of constant energy injection\ncharacterize the forward shock, possibly allowing for efficient particle\nacceleration and high-energy neutrino production.

Both fields have employed different\napproaches and conceived a variety of methods for constraining the properties\nof dark matter, but have done so in relative isolation of one another. From an\nastronomer's perspective, it can be challenging to interpret the results of\ndark matter particle physics experiments and how these results apply to\nastrophysical scales. Over the past few years, the ESCAPE Dark Matter Test\nScience Project has been developing tools to aid the particle physics community\nin constraining dark matter properties; however, ESCAPE itself also aims to\nfoster collaborations between research disciplines. This is especially\nimportant in the search for dark matter, as while particle physics is concerned\nwith detecting the particles themselves, all of the evidence for its existence\nlies solely within astrophysics and cosmology.

Wong", "Andrew Chael", "Alexandru Lupsasca", "Eliot Quataert"], "title": "Black Hole Polarimetry II: The Connection Between Spin and Polarization", "comment": "22 pages, 11 figures", "summary": "We study synchrotron polarization in spatially resolved horizon-scale images,\nsuch as those produced by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). In both general\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations as well as simplified\nmodels of the black hole magnetosphere, the polarization angle, quantified by\nthe complex observable arg(beta_2), depends strongly and systematically on the\nblack hole spin. This relationship arises from the coupling between spin and\nthe structure of the magnetic field in the emission region, and it can be\ncomputed analytically in the force-free limit. To explore this connection\nfurther, we develop a semi-analytic inflow framework that solves the time\nstationary axisymmetric equations of GRMHD in the black hole's equatorial\nplane; this model can interpolate between the force-free and inertial regimes\nby varying the magnetization of the inflow. Our model demonstrates how finite\ninertia modifies the structure of the electromagnetic field and can be used to\nquantitatively predict the observed polarization pattern. By comparing reduced\nmodels, GRMHD simulations, and analytic limits, we show that the observed\nsynchrotron polarization can serve as a robust diagnostic of spin under\nassumptions about Faraday rotation and the emission geometry. Applied to EHT\ndata, the model disfavors high-spin configurations for both M87* and Sgr A*,\nhighlighting the potential of polarimetric imaging as a probe of both black\nhole spin and near-horizon plasma physics."}

Photons traversing\nmagnetized regions can convert into ALPs, producing characteristic,\nenergy-dependent absorption features in astrophysical spectra. The probability\nof such conversions depends sensitively on both the photon energy and the\nproperties of the intervening magnetic fields.\n  Most existing searches have focused on individual astrophysical sources, but\nuncertainties in the structure and strength of cosmic magnetic fields have\nlimited their reach. Recently, we have demonstrated that active galactic nuclei\n(AGNs) observed through galaxy clusters provide especially promising targets\nfor ALP searches. By stacking multiple AGN-cluster sightlines, one can average\nover poorly known magnetic field configurations in galaxy clusters and recover\na distinctive ALP-induced spectral suppression, thereby significantly enhancing\nsensitivity.\n  In this work, we investigate a possible systematic uncertainty in such\nanalyses: the intrinsic time-variability of AGN spectra. We demonstrate that\nAGN flux variability is correlated with spectral hardness, and that\ntime-averaging over flaring and quiescent states can potentially mimic the\nsuppression features imprinted by ALP-photon mixing. Our findings imply that\nthe recent constraints remain conservative, and that incorporating detailed\nspectral variability into stacking analyses can further sharpen the search for\naxion-like particles."}

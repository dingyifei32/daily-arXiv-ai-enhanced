### [1] [On the location of the compact infrared source in Cyg X-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10598)
*Igor I. Antokhin*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 本文是对之前关于X射线双星Cyg X-3（WR+c）的X射线和红外变异性研究的补充，进一步基于定性分析修正了红外源的潜在位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在之前的研究中发现了一个紧凑的红外源，但需要更精确地确定其位置。

Method: 通过简单的定性分析来修正红外源的可能位置。

Result: 提出了红外源更精确的潜在位置。

Conclusion: 本文为之前的研究提供了补充，通过定性分析改进了红外源位置的估计。

Abstract: This note complements the article on X-ray and infrared variability of the
X-ray binary Cyg X-3 (WR+c), published by me and my co-authors (ApJ, v.926, p.
123, 2022). In that paper, a compact IR source was discovered in the system,
located in the vicinity of the X-ray source associated with the relativistic
companion. In the current note I refine the possible location of the IR source
based on simple qualitative considerations.

### [2] [Oscillations of hypothetical strange stars as an efficient source ultra-high-energy particles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10617)
*Joanna Jałocha,Łukasz Bratek*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究了奇异夸克物质（SQM）天体在径向振荡中的动力学行为，发现其能高效将机械能转化为强子能，并可能引发可观测的天体物理现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索SQM天体在潮汐相互作用下的动力学行为及其对天体演化和引力波发射的影响。

Method: 分析了SQM天体在径向振荡中的能量转换机制，特别是临界质量密度下的不稳定性。

Result: 发现即使0.1%的半径变化也能在SQM天体表面产生显著激发能量，并快速转化为电磁能；高振幅振荡可能导致天体碎裂。

Conclusion: SQM天体的径向振荡行为对理解天体演化和引力波发射具有重要意义。

Abstract: We investigate the dynamical behavior of strange quark matter (SQM) objects,
such as stars and planets, when subjected to radial oscillations induced by
tidal interactions in stellar systems. Our study demonstrates that SQM objects
can efficiently convert mechanical energy into hadronic energy due to the
critical mass density at their surfaces of 4.7*10^{14} g/cm^3, below which SQM
becomes unstable and decays into photons, hadrons, and leptons. We show that
even small-amplitude radial oscillations, with a radius change of as little as
0.1%, can result in significant excitation energies near the surface of SQM
stars. This excitation energy is rapidly converted into electromagnetic energy
over short timescales approximately 1 ms, potentially leading to observable
astrophysical phenomena. Higher amplitude oscillations may cause fragmentation
or dissolution of SQM stars, which has important implications for the evolution
of binary systems containing SQM objects and the emission of gravitational
waves.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文通过辐射传输代码Sedona生成了1,800个多波段Ib/c型超新星光变曲线模型，研究了质量分布、速度剖面和丰度喷出物剖面对光变曲线的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Ib/c型超新星光变曲线的物理机制，特别是喷出物速度分布和Ni-56质量的影响，以改进现有半解析模型的推断能力。

Method: 使用辐射传输代码Sedona和自编码器构建喷出物剖面的物理模型，模拟多波段光变曲线，并与已知超新星（如SN 1994I）进行匹配验证。

Result: 喷出物速度分布对光变曲线影响显著，而Ni-56质量对光变曲线影响有限，但会轻微影响颜色演化。多波段光变曲线可用于推断Ni-56质量、喷出物质量和速度分布。

Conclusion: 该方法能够更准确地推断超新星的物理参数，优于现有的半解析模型。

Abstract: We present 1,800 multiwavelength Type Ib/c supernovae light curve models
obtained by running the radiation transport code Sedona and varying the mass
distribution, velocity profile, and abundance ejecta profiles of helium star
progenitors. To create a flexible but physically-informed grid, we use
autoencoders to construct a representation of ejecta profiles derived from
stellar evolution models. We present simulated nearest-neighbor multiband light
curves matches to SN 1994I, SN 2007gr, and iPTF13bvn to demonstrate that
realistic light curves can be generated in our grid. We show that the ejecta
velocity distribution, in particular, strongly influences the light curve,
while variation in Ni-56 alone has a limited impact on the bolometric light
curve, even in extreme and unphysical mixing schemes; however, mixing can
modestly impact color evolution. Finally, we show that the Ni-56 mass, ejecta
mass, and both the magnitude and structure of ejecta velocity distribution can
be inferred from the multiband light curves, enabling improved inference over
widely used semianalytical models.

TL;DR: 高分辨率模拟研究宇宙射线在磁流体动力学湍流中的传播，发现磁场弯曲是关键传输机制，散射具有自相似性，可能解释高能宇宙射线观测现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究宇宙射线在磁流体动力学湍流中的传播机制，以解释高能宇宙射线的观测现象。

Method: 使用分辨率达$10{,}240^3$的模拟，驱动亚音速和超阿尔芬湍流，分析磁场弯曲和粒子散射特性。

Result: 磁场弯曲是粒子传输的关键机制，散射具有自相似性，扩散对能量依赖较弱。

Conclusion: 大振幅磁流体动力学湍流可提供高效散射，可能解释高能宇宙射线的观测现象。

Abstract: We study the propagation of cosmic rays (CRs) through a simulation of
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence at unprecedented resolution of
$10{,}240^3$. We drive turbulence that is subsonic and super-Alfv\'enic,
characterized by $\delta B_{\rm rms}/B_0=2$. The high resolution enables an
extended inertial range such that the Alfv\'en scale $l_A$, where $\delta B
(l_A)\approx B_0$, is well resolved. This allows us to properly capture how the
cascade transitions from large amplitudes on large scales to small amplitudes
on small scales. We find that sharp bends in the magnetic field are key
mediators of particle transport even on small scales via resonant curvature
scattering. We further find that particle scattering in the turbulence shows
strong hints of self-similarity: (1) the diffusion has weak energy dependence
over almost two decades in particle energy and (2) the particles' random walk
exhibits a broad power-law distribution of collision times such that the
diffusion is dominated by the rarest, long-distance excursions. Our results
suggest that large-amplitude MHD turbulence can provide efficient scattering
over a wide range of CR energies and may help explain many CR observations
above a $\sim$TeV: the flattening of the B/C spectrum, the hardening of CR
primary spectra and the weak dependence of arrival anisotropy on CR energy.

### [5] [Accretion from a Shock-Inflated Companion: Spinning Down Neutron Stars to Hour-Long Periods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10682)
*Savannah Cary,Wenbin Lu,Calvin Leung,Tin Long Sunny Wong*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新机制，解释超长周期脉冲星（ULPs）的形成，通过中子星与主序伴星在双星系统中的相互作用，形成吸积盘并导致双峰分布的周期。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统理论无法解释超长周期脉冲星的存在，挑战了对中子星演化和辐射的理解。

Method: 通过流体动力学模拟超新星与伴星的相互作用，研究中子星在爆炸后捕获气体形成吸积盘的过程，并模拟盘与中子星的相互作用。

Result: 发现吸积盘形成概率约10%，产生双峰周期分布：短周期脉冲星和超长周期脉冲星（ULPs），后者形成率约10^-4每年。

Conclusion: 模型为超出“死亡线”的脉冲星提供了统一解释，填补了周期分布的空白。

Abstract: Recent observations have unveiled a population of pulsars with spin periods
of a few minutes to hours that lie beyond the traditional ``death line.'' If
they originate from neutron stars (NSs), the existence of such ultra-long
period pulsars (ULPs) challenges our current understanding of NS evolution and
emission. In this work, we propose a new channel for disk formation based on
NSs born in close binaries with main-sequence companion stars. Using a
hydrodynamic simulation of supernova-companion interactions, we show that a
newborn NS may gravitationally capture gas as it moves through the complex
density field shaped by the explosion. For a binary separation of
$20\rm~R_\odot$ and a companion mass of $4\rm~M_\odot$, we find the occurrence
fraction for disk formation around unbound NSs to be $\sim10\%$. By modeling
the disk evolution and its interaction with the NS, we find a bimodal
distribution in spin periods: canonical pulsars with $P\lesssim10\rm\,s$ are
the ones who lack disks or whose magnetospheres never interacted with the disk,
and ULPs with $10^3\lesssim P<10^5\rm\,s$ are produced when the system
undergoes a short-lived ``propeller'' phase during which the NS undergoes rapid
spin-down. Such ULPs are formed under strong initial dipolar magnetic field
strengths $B_0\gtrsim10^{14}\rm\,G$, with a formation rate of
$10^{-4}\rm\,yr^{-1}$ in the Milky Way. We also find that a small population of
pulsars with moderate magnetic field strengths
($10^{13}\lesssim~B_0\lesssim10^{14}\rm\,G$) and relatively slow initial
periods ($P_0\gtrsim0.1\rm\,s$) evolve to $P\sim10^2\rm\,s$, filling the gap
between the bimodal distribution. Thus, our model provides a unified
explanation for pulsars beyond the ``death line.''

### [6] [Phenomenological Scaling Relations for SQM Stars with a Massive s-Quark in Gravitationally Strong Magnetic Fields under the Spherical Symmetry Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10756)
*Łukasz Bratek,Joanna Jałocha,Marek Kutschera*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究了强磁场下奇异夸克物质（SQM）星的标度关系，推导了最大质量的标度公式，并重新审视了SQM模型的数学结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索强磁场下奇异夸克物质星的标度关系，尤其是最大质量与磁场强度和奇异夸克质量的关系。

Method: 采用球对称近似下的简单耦合模型，推导了最大质量的标度公式，并重新分析了SQM模型的数学结构。

Result: 最大质量与表面磁场和奇异夸克质量相关；奇异夸克质量较大时，最大质量增加。

Conclusion: 标度公式适用于所有参数值，但严格标度仅适用于奇异夸克质量为零的情况；电子项对能量密度的贡献不可忽略。

Abstract: Scaling relations with the bag constant parameter are investigated for
Strange Quark Matter (SQM) stars in the presence of gravitationally strong
magnetic fields minimally coupled with matter, considering both massless and
massive strange quark scenarios. Assuming a simple model for such coupling
under the approximation of spherical symmetry, a phenomenological scaling
formula for the maximum mass of stars is derived as a function of the surface
magnetic field and the strange quark mass. This formula is applicable for all
formally admissible values of the free parameters, and strict scaling with the
bag constant is retained only for a vanishing strange quark mass.
  As a byproduct of this study, the mathematical structure of the equation of
state for the relativistic SQM model with a massive strange quark is revisited
without approximations. It is observed that the contribution of the electron
term to the energy density cannot be neglected in the theoretical limit of
large strange quark masses. Consequently, the maximum mass of SQM stars
increases with sufficiently large strange quark mass, contrasting with the
behavior observed for low strange quark masses.

### [7] [Combined fit above 0.1 EeV to the cosmic-ray spectrum and composition measured with the Pierre Auger Observatory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10806)
*Esteban Roulet*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文通过皮埃尔·奥格天文台数据拟合宇宙射线谱，分析两种不同源群对能谱和成分的影响，探讨银河系与河外源的过渡区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究宇宙射线能谱和成分，特别是高能和低能区域的源群特性，以理解银河系与河外源的过渡机制。

Method: 利用皮埃尔·奥格天文台的地面探测器和荧光探测器数据，拟合能谱和成分，假设两种源群分别主导高能和低能区域。

Result: 高能源群表现为硬谱和较重成分，低能源群为软谱和较轻成分；数据支持银河系贡献在低能区仍显著。

Conclusion: 研究展示了皮埃尔·奥格天文台数据在测试银河系与河外源过渡区域的潜力，磁视界效应可能是低能区河外贡献抑制的原因。

Abstract: We fit the cosmic-ray spectrum measured with the Pierre Auger Observatory's
surface detectors above an energy of $10^{17}$ eV, along with composition
information inferred from the depth of shower maximum measured with its
fluorescence detectors above an energy threshold of $10^{17.8}$ eV. We consider
astrophysical scenarios with two distinct extragalactic source populations: one
dominating the flux above a few EeV, and the other dominating at lower
energies, with representative nuclei being injected at the sources with
power-law spectra and rigidity-dependent cutoffs. The high-energy population
exhibits a hard source injection spectrum and a relatively heavy composition,
while the low-energy population exhibits a softer spectrum and a lighter
composition. Extending the fit down to the low energies considered here shows
the potential to test the energy region towards the Galactic to extragalactic
transition with the data of the Pierre Auger Observatory. In particular, the
Galactic contribution is expected to be still sizable at the lowest energies
considered, and the extragalactic contribution needs to become suppressed for
decreasing energies, an effect that could naturally result from a
magnetic-horizon-induced suppression.

TL;DR: LHAASO观测站精确测量了宇宙射线（CR）在1-10 PeV能区的光谱和质子成分，结合空间探测器数据预测了银河系中弥漫伽马射线和中微子发射光谱，发现模型预测在100 TeV以上超过LHAASO测量值，提出“局部PeV CR气泡”模型解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究银河系中宇宙射线的普遍性及其对弥漫伽马射线和中微子发射的影响。

Method: 利用LHAASO和空间探测器的CR测量数据，预测弥漫伽马射线和中微子光谱，并与Fermi-LAT、LHAASO和IceCube的观测数据对比。

Result: 模型预测在100 TeV以上超过LHAASO伽马射线测量值，提出“局部PeV CR气泡”模型，推断其延伸范围。

Conclusion: 局部PeV CR气泡模型能解释观测到的伽马射线超量，揭示了银河系中CR分布的不均匀性。

Abstract: The LHAASO observatory has recently measured details of the cosmic-ray (CR)
spectrum in the knee region (1 -- 10 PeV) with unprecedented precision,
including its average CR mass composition and the spectrum of the proton
component. We use these precision measurements, combined with direct
measurements of CRs by space-based detectors, to derive predictions for the
spectrum of diffuse gamma-ray and neutrino emission from the interstellar
medium under the assumption that the CR spectrum is universal throughout the
Milky Way. We compare these predictions with the Fermi-LAT and LHAASO
measurements of the diffuse gamma-ray flux from inner and outer Galactic Plane
regions and with estimates of the neutrino flux based on the IceCube data for
the same Galactic Plane regions. We notice that the model predictions exceed
LHAASO gamma-ray measurements at energies above 100 TeV. This excess can be
interpreted within a CR knee model assuming a "local PeV CR bubble''. Within
this model, we infer the extension of the local PeV CR bubble of 1.5 +/- 0.3
kpc in the direction of the inner Galaxy and of 0.7+/-0.3 kpc toward the outer
Galaxy.

TL;DR: VegasAfterglow是一个高性能C++框架，用于灵活高效地模拟伽马射线暴（GRB）余辉，支持多波段辐射计算和复杂环境建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GRB余辉可以提供关于相对论性冲击波、周围环境性质以及喷流结构的物理和几何特性的关键见解。

Method: 开发了VegasAfterglow框架，自洽求解前后向冲击波动力学，计算同步辐射和逆康普顿辐射，支持用户自定义环境密度、喷流结构等参数。

Result: VegasAfterglow在计算性能上表现出色，适用于多波段和多信使天文观测的数据解释。

Conclusion: VegasAfterglow框架为当前和未来的多波段观测提供了强大的建模工具。

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous astrophysical transients, known
to be associated with core collapse of massive stars or mergers of two compact
objects such as two neutron stars. They are followed by multi-wavelength
afterglow emission originating from the deceleration of the relativistic jets
by the ambient medium. The study of after emission offers crucial insights into
the physics of relativistic shocks, the properties of the circumburst
environment, as well as the physical and geometrical structure of relativistic
jets, as well as the viewing geometry of the observer. We present
VegasAfterglow, a newly developed, high-performance C++ framework designed for
modeling GRB afterglows with flexibility and computational efficiency as
keynotes of design. The framework self-consistently solves forward and reverse
shock dynamics and calculates synchrotron (including self-absorption or all
spectral regimes) and inverse Compton radiation (including Klein-Nishina
corrections); it can handle arbitrary user-defined ambient density profiles,
central engine activity histories, viewing angles, and the jet structures of
energy, Lorentz factor, and magnetization profiles. It supports both
relativistic and non-relativistic regimes and includes lateral jet spreading
effects. In this paper, we describe the numerical implementation of the
framework and assess its computational performance. Our results demonstrate
that VegasAfterglow is well-suited for interpreting current and future
multi-wavelength observations in the era of multi-messenger astronomy.

Conclusion: 该方法为探索超高能瞬态事件提供了新途径，可能揭示粒子起源的线索。

Abstract: The origins of ultra-high-energy particles remain one of the most profound
mysteries in astrophysics. If nearby transient sources of ultra-high-energy
particles exist, we might expect correlated emission of neutrinos and photons,
arriving in close temporal and spatial coincidence. The IceCube Neutrino
Observatory, located at the South Pole, is sensitive to neutrinos from TeV to
EeV energies, while the Pierre Auger Observatory, in Argentina, detects cosmic
rays and has the capability of observing ultra-high-energy photons using
surface and fluorescence detectors. The ultra-high-energy photon candidates
reported by the Auger Collaboration, though consistent with cosmic ray
backgrounds, provide a compelling opportunity to search for correlated
neutrino-photon events. In this contribution, we present the framework to
search for ultra-high-energy transients by combining multi-flavour neutrino
data from IceCube with photon candidates from the Auger Detector from 2011 to
2017. We will report the sensitivities that we expect to achieve from the
search and the astrophysical implications of the possible outcomes.

Motivation: 探讨QPEs的物理起源，尤其是周期分散性和温度稳定性的观测特征。

Method: 采用大尺度磁场的盘不稳定性模型，分析临界阈值对系统稳定性的影响。

Result: 模型成功区分稳定和不稳定系统，解释了GSN 069的规律喷发和eRO-QPE1的随机行为，同时解释了温度稳定性。

Conclusion: 该模型为QPEs的观测特征提供了统一解释，支持磁化盘不稳定性作为QPEs的物理机制。

Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are a class of X-ray repeating burst
phenomena discovered in recent years. Many models have been proposed to study
this phenomenon, there remains significant debate regarding the physical origin
of QPEs. In our previous work, we developed a disk instability model with a
large-scale magnetic field and successfully reproduced the light curves and
spectral characteristics of several QPE sources. We further investigate the
model in this work, aiming to explain two key observational features: the
dispersion in eruption periods and the peak temperatures during eruptions. The
model reveals critical thresholds ($\dot{M}_{\rm crit}$, $\beta_{1,\rm crit}$)
that separate systems into stable regimes with minimal period variations and
unstable regimes where periods are highly sensitive to accretion rate and
magnetic field parameter, while peak temperatures remain nearly constant across
the parameter space. This framework successfully explains both the regular
eruptions observed in sources like GSN 069 and the stochastic behavior in
sources like eRO-QPE1, and simultaneously accounting for the observed
temperature stability during long-term QPEs evolution.

Motivation: 研究PG 1553+113的短时标变异性，以限制光子发射区域的大小。

Method: 利用LST-1和XMM-Newton等多波段观测数据，分析2023年耀发期间的快速变异性。

Result: 观测到PG 1553+113在X射线和γ射线波段的快速变异性，包括短至2.4 ks的X射线变化。

Conclusion: LST-1的高灵敏度为研究BL Lac天体的短时标变异性提供了重要工具。

Abstract: PG 1553+113 is a high-frequency peaked BL Lac object (HBL), with redshift
0.433, detected with the current generation of IACTs (Imaging Atmospheric
Cherenkov Telescopes) up to $\sim$ 1 TeV. Interestingly, the continuous
$\gamma$-ray lightcurve collected by Fermi-LAT since 2008 showed a signature of
a periodic modulation of $2.18 \pm 0.08$ years at energies above 100 MeV and 1
GeV. In addition, the source shows clear variabiliy down to day-scale in all
bands. XMM-Newton data recently showed rapid variability in the X-ray band down
to $2.4 \pm 0.7$ ks.
  Short-timescale (sub-hour) variabilities are a key observable to constrain
the size of the photon-emitting region inside the blazar jet. The LST-1 (first
protoype of the Large-Sized Telescope) of the CTAO (Cherenkov Telescope Array
Observatory) is located on Roque de los Muchachos in La Palma, Spain. With its
high sensitivity at low energies (20-150 GeV), it provides a unique opportunity
to investigate such phenomena. In 2023, the source had a very bright flare that
triggered LST-1 and multi-wavelength data campaigns. In this study, we present
the results of this observation campaign, in particular, the search for
short-timescale variabilities.

Abstract: A newly born millisecond magnetar has been proposed as one possible central
engine of some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with X-ray plateau emission. In this
work, we systematically analyzed the \emph{Swift}/XRT data of long GRBs with
plateau emission that were detected before 2023 December, and estimated the
magnetar parameters by considering the $R/I$ evolutionary effects, and
investigated possible relationships among these parameters and their relation
to the GRB jet and magnetar wind radiation. We found that neglecting the
evolutionary effects of $R/I$ can lead to systematic overestimation or
underestimation of magnetar parameters such as magnetic field strength ($B_p$),
spin period ($P_0$), and ellipticity ($\epsilon$) from 20% to 50%. We also
found that some tight correlations among different magnetar parameters, as well
as between the GRB jet emission and the magnetar wind emission for our selected
Equation of states (EoSs). The universal correlations suggest that a nascent
magnetar with the faster $P_0$, lower $B_p$, and lower $\epsilon$ are more
inclined to power more energetic GRB jet, and the ellipticity deformation and
initial spin period of newborn magnetar are likely to originate from the
magnetically-induced distortion and correspond to the equilibrium spin period
as a result of interaction between the magnetar and its accretion disk,
respectively. Finally, we found that the GW signals from the remnants of those
GW-dominated GRBs with redshift measurements cannot reach aLIGO sensitivity
threshold, and only two cases (GRBs 150323A and 170607A) can reach ET
sensitivity threshold. Future GW observations could not only offer the first
smoking gun that a protomagnetar can serve as the central engine of GRBs, but
could also play a crucial role in precisely constraining the neutron EoS.

TL;DR: SN 2024abfo是第七颗直接探测到前身星的IIb型超新星，其前身星可能为A5巨星，单星或双星模型均可解释，但更倾向于双星系统。其光变曲线和光谱特征与其他IIb型超新星有所不同，可能源于外层氢质量极低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究IIb型超新星的前身星性质及其爆炸机制，特别是通过直接探测前身星来验证单星或双星演化模型。

Method: 利用ERIS自适应光学成像和HST存档数据定位前身星，分析其光谱能量分布（SED），并通过半解析光变曲线模型解释观测特征。

Result: 前身星可能为A5巨星，单星质量范围11-15太阳质量，双星模型更可能为12+1.2太阳质量系统。SN 2024abfo是光度最低的IIb型超新星，外层氢质量极低导致光变曲线无显著双峰。

Conclusion: 倾向于双星系统解释SN 2024abfo及其前身星，但无法完全排除单星模型。建议后期观测寻找双星伴星或CSM相互作用的迹象。

SNe showing hydrogen lines in their spectra that gradually weaken and give way
to helium lines reminiscent of SNe Ib, which is indicative of stripping through
stellar winds or binary interaction. SN 2024abfo is the seventh SN IIb with a
direct progenitor detection. We find that the position of the supernova in our
ERIS adaptive optics imaging agrees with the progenitor position in archival
HST imaging to within 19 mas. The progenitor SED is consistent with an A5
giant. Single star models predict an initial mass in the range 11 to 15 solar
masses, while the most probable binary model is a 12+1.2 solar mass system with
an initial period of 1.73 years. We also find significant evidence for
variability of the progenitor candidate in the years prior to core-collapse. SN
2024abfo is the least luminous SN IIb with a direct progenitor detections. At
late times the r-band light curve decays more slowly than the comparison SNe,
which may be due to increased gamma-ray trapping. Similar to SN 2008ax, SN
2024abfo does not show a prominent double-peaked light curve. Our semi-analytic
light curve modelling shows that this may be due to a very low mass of hydrogen
in the outer envelope. Spectrally, SN 2024abfo is most similar to SN 2008ax at
early times while at later times (80 days) it appears to show persistent Halpha
absorption compared to the comparison sample. We prefer a binary system to
explain the supernova and its progenitor, although we are unable to rule out
single-star models. We recommend late-time observations to search for a binary
companion and signatures of CSM-interaction. The absence of these features
would support the hypothesis that SN 2024abfo resulted from a system which
underwent a period of binary mass transfer well before (1000 yr) the explosion,
resulting in a low-mass hydrogen-rich envelope.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究了在均匀磁场和冷暗物质（CDM）包围下的类史瓦西黑洞附近带电粒子的动力学，探讨了磁场和暗物质对高频准周期振荡（HF QPOs）的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索磁场和暗物质分布对紧凑天体附近可观测现象的影响，尤其是对HF QPOs的机制。

Method: 提出了一种修正的度量，计算了基本振荡频率（径向、纬度、开普勒和拉莫尔），并分析了CDM和磁场强度对这些频率的影响。评估了多种QPO生成理论模型。

Result: 发现潮汐撕裂（TD）和扭曲盘（WD）模型在中等磁场强度下对HF QPOs的拟合效果最佳，而其他模型（除ER外）在弱场情况下表现更好。

Conclusion: 强调了在强场天体物理中考虑磁场和暗物质效应的重要性，支持HF QPOs作为黑洞环境的敏感探针。

Abstract: HF QPOs are among the most intriguing phenomena observed in LMXBs containing
BHs or neutron stars. In this work, we investigate charged particles' dynamics
in the nearby of a Schwarzschild-like BH embedded in a uniform magnetic field
and surrounded on all sides by CDM. Thereby gaining deeper insight into the
influence of magnetic and DM distributions on observable phenomena near compact
objects. We first present a modified metric, which incorporates the effects of
a CDM ...
  We compute the fundamental oscillation frequencies-radial, latitudinal,
Keplerian, and Larmor-and demonstrate how their variation depends on the
combined influence of CDM and magnetic field strength. The resulting frequency
structure allows us to identify resonance radii associated with HF QPOs,
particularly those in 3:2 ratios observed in microquasars. We assess several
theoretical models for QPO generation, including the (ER), Relativistic
Precession (RP), Tidal Disruption (TD), and Warped Disk (WD) models. A
comparative fit of observational data from GRS 1915+105, H1743-322, XTE
1550-564, and GRO 1655-40 demonstrate that the TD and WD models provide the
best match for HF QPOs in the presence of moderate magnetic flux ($B' = 0.1$),
while the other models except ER fit better in weak-field scenarios.
  Our results highlight the importance of including both magnetic and dark
matter (DM) effects in strong-field astrophysics and support the use of HF QPOs
as sensitive probes of BH environments. This study opens new perspectives for
exploring particle dynamics, accretion disk structure ...

Motivation: 利用VHE伽马射线观测推断宇宙背景辐射强度及标准模型偏差（如LIV和ALPs），但需考虑局部辐射场的污染效应。

Method: 建模并分析了宿主星系、宇宙环境及银河系沿观测视线产生的辐射场。

Result: 局部辐射场仅对极近源（如半人马座A）的观测有显著影响，对更远源（如M87）影响较小。

Conclusion: 局部辐射场对VHE伽马射线观测的影响有限，主要局限于极近源。

Abstract: In the framework of exploiting Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray observations
of extragalactic sources to infer constraints on the intensity of cosmological
background radiations, as well as on deviations from the standard model of
particles and physical interactions (like violations of Lorentz invariance and
axion-like particles -- LIV and ALPs), we discuss here possible contaminant
effects due to the presence of radiations fields from local sources. We
specifically model and analyze the foreground radiations produced inside the
host galaxy of the VHE source and the cosmic environment itself hosting the
source, as well as radiations produced in the Milky Way, along the VHE source's
observational line-of-sights. Our analysis shows that such contaminant
foregrounds may indeed impact on observations of only the very local Active
Galactic Nuclei (e.g. Centaurus A), but not significantly those in the Virgo
cluster (M87) and beyond.

Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) interacting with molecular clouds are interesting
laboratories to study the acceleration of cosmic rays and their propagation in
the dense ambient medium. We analyze 14 years of Fermi-LAT observations of the
supernova remnant Puppis A to investigate its asymmetric $\gamma$-ray
morphology and spectral properties. This middle-aged remnant ($\sim$4 kyr) is
evolving in an inhomogeneous environment, interacting with a dense molecular
cloud in the northeast and a lower-density medium in the southwest. We find
clear differences in both $\gamma$-ray luminosity and spectral energy
distribution between these two regions. The emission from both sides is
consistent with a hadronic origin. However, while the southwestern emission can
be explained by standard Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA), the northeastern
side may involve re-acceleration of pre-existing cosmic rays or acceleration
via reflected shocks in the dense cloud environment. Additionally, we identify
two significant $\gamma$-ray excesses outside the remnant, including a
previously unreported source to the south. These features are likely produced
by cosmic rays that have escaped Puppis A and are interacting with nearby dense
molecular material. From this extended emission, we estimate the total energy
in escaping cosmic rays to be $W_{CR} \sim 1.5 \times 10^{49}$ erg, providing
important constraints on cosmic-ray propagation around the remnant.

Motivation: 研究该源因其极规则的爆发行为被称为'时钟爆发源'，此次长时爆发的发现为进一步理解其物理机制提供了机会。

Method: 利用NuSTAR观测数据，采用吸收热康普顿化模型（nthcomp）分析持续辐射，并对爆发进行时间分辨光谱分析。

Result: 爆发持续约600秒，峰值温度为2.10±0.07 keV，发射半径为5.5±2.1 km，峰值光度为9.7×10³⁷ ergs s⁻¹。持续辐射在爆发期间显著增强。

Conclusion: 爆发光谱显著偏离纯热谱，可能与Poynting-Robertson拖曳或冕区再处理有关，为理解中子星爆发机制提供了新线索。

Abstract: The source GS~1826-24 is a neutron star low mass X-ray binary known as the
'clocked burster' because of its extremely regular bursting behavior. We report
on the detection of a long type-I X-ray burst from this source. We perform a
detailed spectroscopic analysis of the long X-ray burst, lasting for $\sim 600$
s, seen in the NuSTAR observation carried out on 2022 September. The persistent
emission is well described by an absorbed thermal Comptonization model
(nthcomp), and the source exhibits a hard spectral state during this
observation. The observed burst exhibits a rise time of $\sim 25$ s and a decay
time of $\sim 282$ s. The time-resolved spectroscopy of the burst shows a
significant departure from a pure thermal spectrum and is described with a
model consisting of a varying-temperature blackbody plus an evolving persistent
emission component. We observe a significant enhancement in the persistent
emission during the burst. The enhancement of the pre-burst persistent flux is
possibly due to Poynting-Robertson drag or coronal reprocessing. At the peak of
the burst, the blackbody temperature and the blackbody emitting radius reached
a maximum of $2.10\pm 0.07$ keV and $5.5\pm 2.1$ km, respectively. The peak
flux ($F_{peak}$) during the burst is $\approx 2.4\times 10^{-8}$ ergs
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, which corresponds to a luminosity of $\approx 9.7\times
10^{37}$ ergs s$^{-1}$.

Motivation: 探究黑洞X射线双星中吸积与喷流之间的详细联系，利用MAXI J1820+070的高密度观测数据填补相关研究的空白。

Method: 利用Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array、MeerKAT（射电）、Swift（X射线）和Las Cumbres Observatory（光学）设备，对MAXI J1820+070的整个爆发过程进行了高密度观测。

Conclusion: MAXI J1820+070的再增亮事件与修正的盘不稳定性模型一致，揭示了吸积盘内区辐射的作用。

Abstract: The black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820$+$070 began its first recorded
outburst in March 2018, and remained an active radio, X-ray, and optical source
for over four years. Due to the low distance to the source and its
intrinsically high luminosity MAXI J1820$+$070 was observed extensively over
this time period, resulting in high-cadence and quasi-simultaneous observations
across the electromagnetic spectrum. These data sets provide the opportunity to
probe the connection between accretion and the launch of jets in greater detail
than for the majority of black hole X-ray binaries. In this work we present
radio (Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array, MeerKAT), X-ray (Swift), and
optical (Las Cumbres Observatory) observations of MAXI J1820$+$070 throughout
its entire outburst, including its initial hard state, subsequent soft state,
and further hard-state-only re-brightenings (covering March 2018 to August
2022). Due to the regularity and temporal density of our observational data we
are able to create a Radio - X-ray - Optical activity plane where we find a
high degree of correlation between the three wave bands during the hard states,
and observe hysteresis as MAXI J1820$+$070 enters and exits the soft state.
Based on the morphology of the optical light curves we see evidence for optical
jet contributions during the soft-to-hard state transition, as well as fading
optical emission well before the hard to soft transition. We establish that the
remarkably similar profiles of the re-brightening events are broadly consistent
with modified disk instability models where irradiation from the inner
accretion disk is included.

Abstract: Gamma-ray binaries present emission that is variable and can reach UHE. The
processes behind the acceleration of the particles that produce this very
energetic radiation are yet to be understood. We probe the properties of the
particle accelerator and the UHE photon emitter in the gamma-ray binary LS
5039. From the properties of the binary system and the UHE radiation detected
by HAWC, we used analytical tools to investigate how these properties constrain
the emission and acceleration regions, namely the role of synchrotron losses,
particle confinement, and the accelerated particle spectrum, and propose an
acceleration scenario that can relax the derived constraints. The modest target
densities for hadronic processes and the overall gamma-ray orbital variability
favor inverse Compton scattering of ultraviolet photons from the massive
companion star by highly relativistic electrons. The acceleration of the
highest energy electrons implies a constraint on synchrotron cooling in the
acceleration region, which can set an upper limit on its magnetic field.
Moreover, the detected variability requires very strong particle confinement in
both the acceleration and emission regions, which sets a lower limit on their
magnetic fields that is barely consistent with the synchrotron cooling
constraint from acceleration. Synchrotron losses may be higher in the emitting
region if it is separated from the accelerator, but this requires a very hard
particle injection spectrum. A scenario for LS 5039 of the kind proposed by
Derishev and collaborators, in which an ultrarelativistic magnetized outflow
accelerates leptons injected within the outflow by gammagamma absorption,
provides a viable mechanism to accelerate very energetic electrons. This
mechanism relaxes the acceleration and confinement requirements by reducing the
impact of synchrotron cooling, and can generate the required particle spectrum.

Motivation: 研究LISA如何通过引力波数据区分银河双星系统中的黑洞和中子星，并探讨其在天体物理和银河系演化研究中的应用。

Method: 生成合成LISA数据集，模拟黑洞、中子星和混合双星系统的引力波信号，使用贝叶斯推断管道分析质量测量精度。

Result: 约10%-50%的系统能通过测量轨道参数确定质量，误差为1%-100%，部分系统可分类为黑洞或中子星，并能确定其三维位置。

Conclusion: LISA将提供银河系黑洞和中子星的新信息，但部分系统的成分仍无法明确。

Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect ~ 100 galactic
binary systems comprised of black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs).
Identifying the nature of the constituents of these binaries as BHs or NSs, and
distinguishing them from $\sim 10^4$ detected double white dwarfs will be
challenging. In the absence of any other information, the inferred values of
the component masses can be used to classify the nature of these objects.
However, short-period galactic binaries $\sim 10^7 - 10^3$ yr from coalescence
produce a quasi-monochromatic signal which carries little information about
their masses. We generate synthetic LISA data sets containing gravitational
waves (GWs) from galactic binary BHs, binary NSs and BHNSs drawn from an
astrophysically realistic population produced through the isolated binary
evolution channel. We process the data with an end-to-end Bayesian inference
pipeline to explore the accuracy with which the individual component masses can
be measured. We find that for $\approx 10\% - 50\%$ of the detected systems
LISA will be able to measure the individual component masses by measuring the
orbital eccentricity, periapse precession frequency, and GW induced frequency
derivative. Typical fractional mass errors are $\approx 1\% - 100\%$ (depending
on the specific value of the source parameters), which will enable in many
circumstances the classification of the objects as BHs or NSs. For these
binaries, LISA will also be able to determine their 3-dimensional position in
the Milky Way. The LISA-detected sample of these double compact objects will
provide new information about the galactic population of BHs and NSs, the star
formation history of the Milky Way and the astrophysical processes leading to
the formation of these systems. However, for a significant fraction of the
LISA-detected binaries the nature of their constituent objects may remain
unclear.

New features include explicit time tracking, time-dependent advection fields,
and support for position-dependent radiation backgrounds, for more realistic
simulations of Galactic and extragalactic propagation. Nuclear cross sections
have been updated and expanded up to lead (Z=82). We illustrate some of these
new features, including acceleration at moving shocks and gamma-ray propagation
in the interstellar radiation field. Together, these improvements establish
CRPropa 3.3 as a comprehensive tool for modelling cosmic rays, gamma rays, and
their secondaries in structured, time-dependent environments, setting the stage
for next-generation multi-messenger astrophysics.

Abstract: Under the standard model of hierarchical structure formation, the overall
geometry of galaxy clusters is better described by a triaxial ellipse than a
sphere. As a result, applying spherically-symmetric models can result in
significant biases. These biases can be mitigated by fitting a triaxial model,
requiring deep multiprobe data and a set of physically motivated models to
describe them. Here we present a multiprobe triaxial analysis methodology based
on the data available for galaxy clusters in the Cluster Heritage project with
XMM-Newton - Mass Assembly and Thermodynamics at Endpoint of structure
formation (CHEX-MATE), which includes X-ray data from XMM-Newton, SZ data from
Planck and ACT, and WL data from Subaru. This work builds on our previous
development of a gas-only X-ray and SZ triaxial fitting formalism in Paper I.
We apply our approach to the CHEX-MATE cluster PSZ2 G313.33+61.13 (Abell 1689)
and find that it is elongated along the line of sight relative to the plane of
sky by a factor of $\mathcal{R}_{LP} = 1.27 \pm 0.02$. As a result, the WL mass
obtained from our triaxial fit,
$\text{M}_{200c}=(13.69_{-1.41}^{+1.56})\times10^{14} \text{M}_{\odot}$, is
significantly lower than the value of $(17.77_{-1.75}^{+2.00})\times10^{14}
\text{M}_{\odot}$ obtained from a spherically-symmetric fit that otherwise
employs the same methodology. Our triaxial fit finds a concentration of
$c_{200c}=8.55_{-1.61}^{+2.20}$, consistent with the spherically-symmetric
value of $9.99_{-1.78}^{+2.26}$, which suggests that the unexpectedly high
concentration in Abell 1689 is not due to triaxiality and orientation. We also
measure the non-thermal pressure fraction at radii between 0.18-1.37 Mpc,
finding a minimum of approximately 20 per cent at intermediate radii increasing
to near 30 per cent at both the smallest and largest radii, and with a typical
measurement precision of $\pm$5 per cent.

Abstract: This work delves into the dynamical dark energy models of the wCDM
parameterisation that are defined by their equation of state by comparing
different, well-known parameterisation models, in an attempt to lessen the
tensions of {H_0} and {\sigma_8} by using the latest observational data. This
research also tested the newer Planck likelihood and BAO data by comparing them
to their predecessors. The data that was used were: the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) data of Planck 2018 and Planck 2020 data; Cosmic Chronometers
(CC), a sample of Supernovae Type Ia; and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO).
A Bayesian analysis was performed to produce the results needed for the
analysis. From the analyses, the best-fit values of the parameters show that
almost all models are in favour of a phantom Universe. This study also showed
that the new tested data constrained the models better than the previous ones,
while also showing that the observation data supports the {\Lambda}CDM model
over the dynamical dark energy models

Abstract: Aims. Quasar catalogues from narrow-band photometric data are used in a
variety of applications, including targeting for spectroscopic follow-up,
measurements of supermassive black hole masses, or Baryon Acoustic
Oscillations. Here, we present the final quasar catalogue, including redshift
estimates, from the miniJPAS Data Release constructed using several flavours of
machine-learning algorithms. Methods. In this work, we use a machine learning
algorithm to classify quasars, optimally combining the output of 8 individual
algorithms. We assess the relative importance of the different classifiers. We
include results from 3 different redshift estimators to also provide improved
photometric redshifts. We compare our final catalogue against both simulated
data and real spectroscopic data. Our main comparison metric is the $f_1$
score, which balances the catalogue purity and completeness. Results. We
evaluate the performance of the combined algorithm using synthetic data. In
this scenario, the combined algorithm outperforms the rest of the codes,
reaching $f_1=0.88$ and $f_1=0.79$ for high- and low-z quasars (with $z\geq2.1$
and $z<2.1$, respectively) down to magnitude $r=23.5$. We further evaluate its
performance against real spectroscopic data, finding different performances. We
conclude that our simulated data is not realistic enough and that a new version
of the mocks would improve the performance. Our redshift estimates on mocks
suggest a typical uncertainty of $\sigma_{\rm NMAD} =0.11$, which, according to
our results with real data, could be significantly smaller (as low as
$\sigma_{\rm NMAD}=0.02$). We note that the data sample is still not large
enough for a full statistical consideration.

Motivation: 探索暗能量的性质及其动态行为，通过广义参数化模型覆盖多种现有模型，并生成新的参数化形式。

Method: 采用三种自由参数（w0、wβ、β）描述暗能量EoS，结合多种宇宙学观测数据（CMB、BAO、超新星等）进行约束分析。

Result: 当前暗能量EoS处于quintessence模式，未发现显著动态行为；广义模型在统计上略优于CPL参数化，但差异不显著。

Conclusion: 广义暗能量模型与现有数据兼容，但未显著优于CPL参数化，未来需更多数据验证动态暗能量的可能性。

Abstract: We consider a general dark energy (DE) model parametrized by its
equation-of-state (EoS), featuring three free parameters: $w_0$ (the
present-day value of the DE EoS), $w_{\beta}$ (quantifying the dynamical nature
of the DE EoS), and $\beta$ (governing various dynamical forms of the DE EoS).
The key controlling parameter $\beta$ can recover several existing DE models in
the literature, such as the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization
($\beta = 1$), the logarithmic parametrization (in the limit $\beta \rightarrow
0$), and the linear parametrization ($\beta = -1$), alongside generate a class
of new DE parametrizations for other values of $\beta$. The resulting DE
scenario is constrained using a suite of the latest cosmological probes,
including Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization
anisotropies from three different experiments (Planck 2018 and Atacama
Cosmology Telescope combined with WMAP), CMB lensing, Baryon Acoustic
Oscillations from DESI Year 2, and PantheonPlus from Type Ia supernovae. Our
analyses reveal that stringent constraints on the DE parameters are obtained
only when all cosmological probes are combined; otherwise, some parameters
remain unconstrained. The present-day value of the DE EoS remains in the
quintessence regime according to our results, and no significant evidence for a
dynamical DE EoS is found. However, based on the $\Delta\chi^2$ and Bayesian
evidence analyses, we observe a mild preference for the present three-parameter
DE parametrization over the CPL parametrization when all cosmological probes
are taken into account. Nonetheless, the Bayesian evidence difference remains
below the threshold for statistical significance according to the revised
Jeffreys scale, indicating that both models are effectively equally preferred
by the data.

Conclusion: 结合物理模型和机器学习的方法能够发挥两者的优势，为未来星系巡天提供了一种高效的工具。

Abstract: Spectroscopic redshift surveys are key tools to trace the large-scale
structure (LSS) of the Universe and test the $\Lambda$CDM model. However, using
redshifts as distance proxies introduces distortions in the 3D galaxy
distribution. If uncorrected, these distortions lead to systematic errors in
LSS analyses and cosmological parameter estimation. We present a new method
that combines linear theory (LT) and a neural network (NN) to mitigate redshift
space distortions (RSDs). The hybrid LT+NN approach is trained and validated on
dark matter halo fields from z = 1 snapshots of the Quijote N-body simulations.
LT corrects large-scale distortions in the linear regime, while the NN learns
quasi-linear and small-scale features. The LT correction is applied first, then
the NN is trained on the resulting fields to improve accuracy across scales.
The method uses a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and yields significant
performance gains: approximately 50% improvement over LT alone and 12% over NN
alone. The reconstructed fields from the LT+NN method show stronger
correlations with the true real-space fields than either LT or NN separately.
The hybrid method also improves clustering statistics such as halo-halo and
halo-void correlations, with benefits extending to BAO scales. Compared to
NN-only, it provides better suppression of spurious anisotropies on large and
quasi-linear scales, as measured by the quadrupole moments of correlation
functions. This work shows that combining a physically motivated dynamical
model with a machine learning algorithm leverages the strengths of both
approaches. The LT+NN method achieves high accuracy with modest training data
and computational cost, making it a promising tool for future applications to
more realistic galaxy surveys.

Abstract: The Cosmic Distance Duality Relation (CDDR) connects the angular diameter
distance ($d_A$) and the luminosity distance ($d_L$) at a given redshift. This
fundamental relation holds in any metric theory of gravity, provided that
photon number is conserved and light propagates along null geodesics. A
deviation from this relation could indicate new physics beyond the standard
cosmological model. In this work, we test the validity of the CDDR at very low
redshifts ($z < 0.04$) by combining $d_A$ from the Megamaser Cosmology Project
with $d_L$ from the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa). We find the
relation to be statistically consistent with the current data. We further
incorporate high-redshift Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO)-based $d_A$
measurements from DESI DR2 in combination with SNIa data, highlighting the
critical role of the $r_d-M_b$ (early-late) calibration in testing the CDDR
using these two probes. Assuming CDDR holds, we perform a Bayesian analysis to
derive model-independent constraints on the calibration parameters. Using only
BAO and SNIa data, we observe a strong degeneracy between $r_d$ and $M_b$.
However, the inclusion of calibration-free Megamaser measurements breaks this
degeneracy, enabling independent constraints without relying on a specific
cosmological model or distance-ladder techniques. Additionally, we present a
forecast incorporating the expected precision from future Megamaser and SNIa
observations, demonstrating their potential to significantly tighten
constraints on early-late calibration parameters, under the assumption of
validity of CDDR.

Abstract: We present direct measurements of the intrinsic alignments (IA) of over 2
million spectroscopic galaxies using DESI Data Release 1 and imaging from four
lensing surveys: DES, HSC, KiDS, and SDSS. In this uniquely data-rich regime,
we take initial steps towards a more tailored IA modelling approach by building
a library of IA measurements across colour, luminosity, stellar mass, and
redshift. We map the dependence between galaxy type -- in terms of rest-frame
colour, strength of the 4000 Angstrom break, and specific star formation rate
-- and IA amplitude; the bluest galaxies have an alignment consistent with
zero, across low (0.05<z<0.5) and high (0.8<z<1.55) redshifts. In order to
construct cosmic shear samples that are minimally impacted by IA but maintain
maximum sample size and statistical power, we map the dependence of alignment
with colour purity. Red, quenched galaxies are strongly aligned and the
amplitude of the signal increases with luminosity, which is tightly correlated
with stellar mass in our catalogues. For DESI galaxies between 0<z<1.5, trends
in luminosity and colour alone are sufficient to explain the alignments we
measure -- with no need for an explicit redshift dependence. In a companion
paper (Jeffrey et al., in prep), we perform detailed modelling of the IA
signals with significant detections, including model comparison. Finally, to
direct efforts for future IA measurements, we juxtapose the
colour-magnitude-redshift coverage of existing IA measurements against modern
and future lensing surveys.

Pessah"], "title": "The impact of magnetic fields during tidal disruption events", "comment": "Submitted to MNRAS, comments are welcome!", "summary": "During a tidal disruption event (TDE) the stream debris inherits the magnetic field of the star. As the stream stretches, the magnetic field evolves and can eventually become dynamically important. We study this effect by means of magnetohydrodynamic simulations and a semi-analytic model of the disruption of a main-sequence star by a supermassive black hole. For stellar magnetic fields stronger than $\\sim 10^4\\,\\rm{G}$, magnetic pressure becomes important in a significant fraction of the mass of the stream, leading to a fast increase in its thickness, an effect that may impact its subsequent evolution. We find that this dynamical effect is associated with a phase of transverse equilibrium between magnetic and tidal forces, which causes the stream width to increase with distance to the black hole as $H \\propto R^{5/4}$. In the unbound tail, this fast expansion could enhance the radio emission produced by the interaction with the ambient medium, while in the returning stream, it may qualitatively affect the subsequent gas evolution, particularly the gas dynamics and radiative properties of shocks occurring after the stream's return to pericentre. By characterizing the magnetohydrodynamic properties of the stream from disruption to the first return to pericentre, this work provides physically motivated initial conditions for future studies of the later phases of TDEs, accounting for magnetic fields. This will ultimately shed light on the role of magnetic fields in enabling angular momentum transport in the ensuing accretion disk, thereby affecting observable signatures such as X-ray radiation and relativistic outflows."}

We connect several features of the gravitational wave signal from each model to its previously explored explosion dynamics. In particular, the greater accretion onto the PNS of the more compact model is evident in broad-band frequency features with larger amplitude gravitational wave strains and greater gravitational wave energy release when compared to the less compact model. Additionally, the faster contraction rate of the more compact model is reflected in the $\\sim$26% greater slope of the $g$-/$f$-mode feature (gfF) evolution of the gravitational wave signal.

This makes it crucial to deeply understand the behaviour of our analysis pipelines. A counterintuitive feature of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) second data release is that restricting the dataset to the last 10.3 years (DR2new) increases the inferred GWB significance from $\\leq2σ$ for the full 25-year dataset (DR2full) to $\\geq3.5σ$. We investigate whether this behaviour indicates an anomaly or is a possible outcome of the pipeline. Using realistic, DR2-like simulations with varying timespans, we find that the first 10 years contribute little to the GWB evidence due to their limited frequency coverage. This produces substantial overlap between the HD S/N distributions of DR2full and DR2new. Random noise fluctuations therefore yield a higher GWB evidence in DR2new than in DR2full in $15\\%$ of cases. Furthermore, $5\\%$ of simulations match the HD S/N of the real data, indicating that the observed behaviour is consistent with being a $\\sim2σ$ outcome due to noise fluctuations. Regardless of significance, DR2new simulations introduce biases in the GWB parameter estimation due to spectral leakage effects that are ignored in standard analyses and which flatten the inferred spectrum. Including leakage removes these biases, demonstrating the reliability of DR2new when the signal is properly modelled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that combining EPTA DR2full with long-baseline data from NANOGrav and PPTA, as well as low-frequency data from LOFAR and NenuFAR, significantly enhances GWB evidence and parameter accuracy. Finally, we examine the impact of the observation timespan and find that short-baseline datasets introduce strong amplitude biases and are ineffective at constraining the GWB."}

In this paper, using a data-driven framework based on binned Gaussian processes, we characterize the joint distribution of BBH primary masses, mass ratios, and effective inspiral spins. We identify three distinct subpopulations in the GWTC-4 sample of observations and investigate their astrophysical origins. We find that only one of the three subpopulations exhibits the $35M_{\\odot}$ peak, which is characterized by a strong preference for equal mass systems and isotropic spin orientations. Our inferred distributions are consistent with a predominantly dynamical origin of this feature. By comparing with theoretical simulations, we further show that the subpopulation that exhibits the $35M_{\\sun}$ peak can exclusively comprise dynamically assembled systems in globular clusters, specifically if black hole birth spins are in the range~$(0.1-0.2)$, whereas the other two subpopulations require substantial contributions from alternative formation channels. We constrain the \\textit{lower bound} on the merger rate of BBHs in globular clusters to be $0.69^{+0.23}_{-0.33} \\rm{Gpc}^{-3}\\rm{yr}^{-1}$, which is consistent with theoretical predictions.

While the best-fit suggests deviation, results remain consistent with General Relativity ($α=0$) within the $2σ$ confidence level. Based on these constraints, we model the secular mass accretion history (treating accretion efficiency as a phenomenological constant) and compute the shadow radius evolution. We find that in a realistic dispersive plasma environment, refractive effects significantly mask intrinsic gravitational and dark energy signatures, causing global shadow shrinkage. Nevertheless, a characteristic systematic intrinsic deviation of $\\sim 1\\%$--$1.5\\%$ (under a conservative accretion scenario) persists at redshifts $z \\lesssim 1.5$ relative to standard $Λ$CDM predictions.

The $B_p-P_0$ relation indicates that $P_0$ may not be true initial spin period of newborn magnetar, but had reached an equilibrium spin period via fallback accretion in propeller model. The magnetar accretion rate in our LGRBs is in range of $\\dot{M}\\sim10^{-5}-10^{-2} M_{\\odot} \\rm s^{-1}$ by incorporating $R/I$ evolutionary effects, and using the transition relation between gravitational mass $M_g$ and baryonic mass $M_b$ in different equation of states.

We suggested that adopting a constant $R/I/M_g$ scenario for modeling propeller regime in accreting magnetar results in a higher mass accretion rate, which may impair our understanding of the physical nature and its surroundings of accreting magnetar, and low-metallicity progenitors can provide enough material to satisfy the accretion requirements of newborn accreting magnetar in LGRBs."}

As such, observing strategies are adapting, with a current trend focusing on late-time X-ray follow-ups of (optical) TDEs. While these campaigns are so far proving quite successful, the inherent confirmation bias they introduce in our sample could lead the community to hasty, and perhaps erroneous, conclusions. It is thus important to still pursue the search for nuclear transients in other, more agnostic directions. In this work, we focus on the observational aspects of our field, and lay out two different methods that can be deployed in order to reveal new QPE sources. These complementary methods enable the detection of long-term ($\\sim$years) and short term ($\\sim$minutes) transient events, that would have otherwise been missed by the standard detection pipelines. Both of these methods can be used either for data mining in the 25 years worth of XMM-Newton archive, or to trigger real-time follow-ups upon a more recent discovery."}

To support these efforts, we extend the CRK-HACC framework, a GPU-accelerated cosmological hydrodynamics code, with a suite of astrophysical subgrid models that simulate radiative cooling, star formation, stellar evolution, and AGN feedback within a numerically robust formulation optimized for scalability on modern exascale architectures. The models were selected and calibrated to reproduce observed galaxy stellar mass functions over the redshift range $0 < z < 2$ and cluster populations probed by cosmological surveys, capturing the large-scale baryonic evolution relevant for multi-wavelength, cross-correlated analyses.

First, we find that GRBs with both extended emission and X-ray plateau satisfy a three-parameter relation between the luminosity and the end time of X-ray plateaus and the $γ$-ray isotropic energy as $L_X\\varpropto T_a^{-1.13}E_{γ,iso}^{0.74}$, which is consistent with that of normal GRBs. Second, we distinguish these GRBs in the plane of magnetic field versus period of neutron star and find that almost all GRBs but GRB 211024B have reasonable periods and majority of them could be powered by magnetars. Third, we standardize the X-ray afterglows with distinct characteristics and find that the standard X-ray light curves with/without plateaus are significantly different. The standardized X-ray plateaus are similar to the mean temporal profile of magnetars. Fourth, it is verified with a K-S test that all types of GRBs except short ones have the similar distributions of redshift and isotropic energy in the observer/rest frame. GRBs with internal plateaus are significantly different from those of normal long GRBs and GRBs with external plateaus and/or extended emissions. Interestingly, the isotropic energy distributions of GRBs with internal and external plateaus are identical with those of short and long GRBs, respectively. Overall, our study can bring solid evidence that the fascinating magnetars could have multi-formation channels to account for not only short but also long GRBs with either internal or external X-ray plateaus as well."}

With increasingly sensitive instruments being deployed, secondary $B$-modes induced by the weak gravitational lensing of CMB photons are becoming an important limitation and need to be removed, a process known as delensing. In this work, we combine internally reconstructed CMB lensing maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 with galaxy samples from unWISE and a map of the cosmic infrared background (CIB) fluctuations from Planck to produce a well-correlated tracer of the CMB lensing field. Our co-added tracer, shown to be 55-85% correlated with the true lensing convergence at multipoles $L \\leq 2000$, is then convolved with ACT DR6 $E$-mode polarization to yield a template of the lensing $B$-modes. We assess its performance on a wide range of scales by using it to delens ACT DR6 and Planck $B$-modes over 23% of the sky, removing around 39% of the lensing power at $100\\leq l \\leq 1500$ and 47% at $30 \\leq l \\leq 300$, respectively.

We demonstrate the pinning of an initially moving vortex to the lattice through excitation of lattice vibrations, and show that the efficiency of this process is higher for attractive than for repulsive nucleus-vortex interactions. We explore the unpinning of a vortex under the action of the applied Magnus force, and find that it is influenced by multiple parameters, including the sign of the pinning force, the lattice orientation, composition, temperature, and the energy of pinning to individual nucleus. In lattices with multiple grains, the unpinning transition is triggered inside the grains with weaker pinning, propagates along the vortex (mediated by the excited Kelvin waves) and crosses into grains with stronger pinning. This is likely to effectively decrease the critical force at which vortices unpin and to produce extended regions of unpinned vorticity. Shearing of the crust lattice (e.g., by a starquake) initiates the unpinning of the vortices that are crossing the slip plane. A close encounter of an unpinned vortex with a pinned vortex would cause the latter to unpin, perhaps initiating an unpinning avalanche of many vortices."}

These priors take input from constraints on the nuclear equation of state and neutron star population models. Applied to GW170817, GW190425, and GW230529, we highlight two contributions of the framework. First, we demonstrate its ability to provide source classification and to enable model selection of equation of state constraints for loud signals such as GW170817, directly from the gravitational-wave data. Second, we obtain narrower constraints on the source properties through these informed priors. As a result, the neural priors consistently recover higher luminosity distances compared to agnostic priors.

Combining radio data (300-1400 MHz) with archival X-ray data offers a unique opportunity to study the complex ICM physics of the cluster. The sensitive uGMRT observations map the halo emission for the first time out to an extent of ~3.3 Mpc, up to $r_{500}$, and also effectively recover other diffuse sources. The radio surface brightness profile is well fitted with an exponential function up to r$_{500}$, with an evolution of e-folding radius over frequencies (larger at low frequencies). The spatially resolved spectral index map reveals fluctuations and outward radial steepening of the average spectral index. Radio and X-ray surface brightness are well correlated, with a correlation slope of $\\sim$0.70 for the halo, and $\\sim$0.40 for the ridge. The correlation slope varies from cluster centre to outskirts, suggesting the magnetic field and thermal gas density scaling relation (B $\\propto n_{e}^{0.5}$) should be reassessed, provided that the re-acceleration efficiency is constant. We propose that diffuse lobes at the periphery could serve as a reservoir for seed electrons, behind the radio halo emission, with an estimated acceleration efficiency reaching $\\sim$0.1% in the external regions.

Apart from that, some of the objects were found to be unassociated with any other classes, and no information is available in other wavebands. These types of objects are classified as unassociated objects in the Fermi catalog. To classify the unassociated objects into known categories and BCUs into a known type of blazar, numerous efforts have been made using the machine learning approach. The ideal way of classification would be to have multi-wavelength temporal and spectral information, which is nearly impossible to have for this number of objects in the near future. In this paper, we focus on classifying BCUs into other types of blazars, such as FSRQs and BL Lacs. For this purpose, we have developed for the first time a deep feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify them, using multi-wavelength data. The complete understanding of blazars can only be known through multi-wavelength observation, and hence, we begin with four input parameters that cover broadband information (radio, optical, X-ray fluxes, and redshift) to train the neural network, and then extend the framework by including additional parameters to examine their impact on the outcome."}

This classification of singular points where both Stokes parameters $Q$ and $U$ vanish stems from the fact that linear polarization is described by a second-rank tensor. By varying the number of spherical harmonics included in the polarization maps, one can probe the statistics of these singularities across a range of angular scales. Applying this method to Planck data we find clear evidence of non-Gaussianity in both $E$ and $B$ modes of polarization. This approach may be especially useful for processing data from current and future experiments such as the Simons Observatory (SO). In particular, it can help to assess the Gaussianity of a potentially detected B mode signal, thereby determining whether it arises from primordial tensor perturbations -- as predicted by inflation -- or from alternative sources such as polarized foregrounds (e.g., thermal dust), E-to-B mode leakage, systematics, photon noise or gravitational lensing.

We first revisit and significantly update astrophysical constraints from compact objects, utilizing rigorous expressions and additional white dwarf data related to ignition and subsequent supernovae. Crucially, we then explore novel signatures of Fermi-balls in future gravitational wave experiments like LISA and TianQin, performing detailed signal-to-noise ratio and Fisher matrix analyses.

Turbulence in the intracluster medium (ICM), which may be induced by AGN activity or pre-existing motions, has been proposed as a potential heating mechanism based on analysis of Chandra X-ray surface brightness fluctuations. However, subsequent simulation results have found the subdominant role of turbulence in heating the ICM. To investigate this discrepancy, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a Perseus-like cluster including both AGN feedback and pre-existing turbulence, which is stirred to the observationally constrained level in the Perseus cluster. Our results indicate that, although the velocity field is dominated by the pre-existing turbulence, AGN heating through bubbles and shocks remains significant. More importantly, analysis of the velocity structure function and the energy power spectrum shows that the turbulent heating rate is smaller than the radiative cooling rate, especially in the cluster core. Our results offer insights relevant for recent XRISM observations and indicate that turbulent heating alone cannot offset radiative cooling in CC clusters."}

Linking the kSZ power spectrum to the properties of ionising sources would provide an opportunity to use such observations to access astrophysical and cosmological information from the Epoch of Reionisation, including the morphology of ionised regions, while simultaneously improving CMB analyses. The aim of this work is to assess this potential of the kSZ power spectrum to measure reionisation-era galaxy properties. We repurpose the publicly available LoReLi II simulations, which track the evolution of neutral hydrogen during reionisation, to generate a training set of patchy kSZ angular power spectra. We then train an emulator using neural network regression in order to allow for efficient Bayesian inference, and conduct forecasts assuming mock observations from current and future CMB experiments. We find that measurements of the kSZ power spectrum from such surveys can provide meaningful constraints on several of the astrophysical model parameters of the LoReLi II suite, including the ionising escape fraction for which we expect a 14% relative error, on average. They also provide an independent measurement of the CMB optical depth, marginalised over the astrophysics and with error bars competitive with the cosmic variance limit from large scale surveys. The kSZ power spectrum offers a promising avenue for probing the properties of reionisation-era galaxies and providing an independent measurement of the CMB optical depth with upcoming CMB experiments. Since the error budget of our mock observations is dominated by emulator reconstruction errors, we expect our results could be further improved with a more extended simulation training set."}

The afterglow emission is well understood as the synchrotron radiation from the shock-accelerated electrons in the medium swept up by the blast wave. The same distribution of electrons also inverse-Compton upscatters the softer synchrotron photons to produce the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) TeV emission. Accurate modeling of this component generally requires a computationally expensive numerical treatment, which makes it impractical when fitting to observations using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Simpler analytical formalisms are often limited to broken power-law solutions and some predict an artificially high Compton-Y parameter. Here we present a semi-analytic framework for a spherical blast wave that accounts for adiabatic cooling and expansion, photon escape, and equal-arrival-time-surface integration, in addition to Klein-Nishina effects. Our treatment produces the broadband afterglow spectrum and its temporal evolution at par with results obtained from more sophisticated kinetic calculations.

We aim to understand the relationship between the power of AGN feedback and the cooling of gas in the centres of galaxy clusters by correlating the radio properties of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) with the X-ray properties of their host clusters. We used catalogues from the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) along with ASKAP radio data. In total, we identified 134 radio sources associated with BCGs of the 151 eRASS1 clusters located in the PS1, PS2, and SWAG-X ASKAP fields. Non-detections were treated as upper limits. We correlated BCG radio luminosity, largest linear size (LLS), and BCG offset with the integrated X-ray luminosity of their host clusters. To characterise cool cores (CCs) and non-cool cores (NCCs), we used the concentration parameter $c_{R_{500}}$ and combined it with the BCG offset to assess cluster dynamical state. We analysed the correlation between radio mechanical power and X-ray luminosity within the CC subsample. We observe a potential positive trend between LLS and BCG offset, suggesting an environmental effect on radio-source morphology. We find a weak trend where more luminous central radio galaxies are found in clusters with higher X-ray luminosity. Within the CC subsample, there is a positive but highly scattered relationship between the mechanical luminosity of AGN jets and the X-ray cooling luminosity. This finding is supported by bootstrap resampling and flux-flux analyses. The correlation indicates that AGN feedback is ineffective in high-luminosity (high-mass) clusters. At a cooling luminosity of $L_{\\mathrm{X},~r<R_\\mathrm{cool}}\\approx 5.50\\times10^{43}$ erg/s, on average, AGN feedback appears to contribute only about 13%-22% of the energy needed to offset the radiative losses in the ICM."}

We describe the dark energy perturbation within two complementary frameworks, namely the Parameterized Post-Friedmann (PPF) approach and the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of dark energy. Using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations together with Planck 2018 CMB data and the Union3 supernova sample, we constrain the effective sound speed of dark energy in both the $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM backgrounds. Within the PPF description, the sound speed remains unconstrained for $w$CDM, while for the $w_0w_a$CDM case we obtain $\\log_{10} c_s^2 = -3.00^{+2.9}_{-0.99}$. Additionally, in the EFT framework, both models favor a small sound speed, with a mean value $c_s^2 \\simeq 0.3$--$0.4$ but with significant uncertainties. For dynamical dark energy, the reconstructed equation of state clearly exhibits a quintom-B behavior, and its deviation from $Λ$CDM reaches $3.42σ$, rising to $3.63σ$ when PPF perturbations are included and reducing to $3.19σ$ in the EFT case. Finally, model comparison using information criteria shows that the $w_0w_a$CDM model with a smooth, non-clustering dark energy component ($c_s^2 = 1$) is preferred by AIC, whereas BIC favors $Λ$CDM. In summary, current data indicate a mild preference for dynamical dark energy but no evidence for significant clustering, which implies the need for future high-precision observations to probe the perturbative behavior more definitively."}

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of six representative DDE parametrization models by utilizing the latest and most precise CMB data jointly from ACT, SPT, and Planck, in conjunction with BAO data from DESI DR2 and SN data from DESY5, PantheonPlus, and Union3. Our overall analysis indicates that the preference for DDE in the Quintom-B regime remains robust, regardless of the DDE parameterization model and the data combination employed. The trend of this preference is significantly strengthened with the support of DESY5 SN data. Specifically, when using the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, for the Barboza-Alcaniz (BA) model, we obtain $w_0 = -0.785 \\pm 0.047$ and $w_a = -0.43^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, which significantly deviate from the $Λ$CDM values and provide evidence for DDE at the $4.2σ$ level.

Cross-correlating these surveys can constrain the redshift distribution of radio sources, mitigate systematic effects, and place constraints on cosmological models. We perform the first measurement of the clustering cross-spectrum between radio-continuum sources in the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey and galaxies from the ESA Euclid satellite mission's Q1 release. Our goal is to detect and characterise the cross-correlation signal, test its robustness against systematic effects, and compare our measurements with theoretical predictions. We use data from the Australian SKA Pathfinder's EMU Main Survey, which overlaps with the Euclid Deep Field South. We generate two radio-source catalogues using different source finders to create galaxy maps. We measure the harmonic-space cross-correlation signal using a pseudo-spectrum estimator. The measured signal is compared to theoretical predictions based on a ΛCDM cosmology, using several models for the EMU source redshift distribution and bias. We report detection above 8σ of the cross-correlation signal consistent across all tested models and data sets. The measured cross-spectra from the two radio catalogues are in excellent agreement, demonstrating that the cross-correlation is robust against the choice of source-finding algorithm. The measured signal also agrees with theoretical models developed from previous cross-correlation studies and simulations. This pathfinder study establishes a statistically significant cross-correlation between EMU and Euclid. The robustness of the signal is a crucial validation of the methodology, paving the way for future large-scale analyses leveraging the full power of this synergy to constrain cosmological parameters and our understanding of galaxy evolution."}

We present a hybrid machine-learning (ML) framework that integrates field-level inference (FLI) with simulation-based inference (SBI) to map observed shear fields directly to cosmological parameters, eliminating the need for convergence reconstruction. The FLI network extracts rich non-Gaussian information from the shear field to produce informative features, which are then used by SBI to model the resulting complex posteriors. To mitigate noise from intrinsic galaxy shapes, we develop a blind, training-free, PCA-based shear denoising method. Tests on CSST-like mock catalogs reveal significant performance gains. The shear-based inference achieves approximately twice the cosmological constraining power in Figure of Merit (FoM) compared to the conventional convergence-based approach. Moreover, the combination of PCA denoising and ML compression can deliver a 36.4% improvement in FoM over standard shear two-point statistics. This work establishes a scalable and robust pathway for cosmological inference, unlocking the full potential of Stage-IV weak-lensing surveys."}

For fermions with a Yukawa coupling to a sufficiently light scalar mediator, rapid oscillations of the scalar field can lead to a conservative force law with fractional behaviour on sufficiently large scales. We study cosmological systems evolving under both this fractional potential and the Newtonian potential using high-resolution N-body simulations. We find that, at the same mass scale, halos that form under the fractional potential are much more dense than those that from the Newtonian potential. However, we also find that the perturbed scalar field may have large fluctuations once halo sizes become comparable to an effective Compton length, which will modify subsequent clustering and collapse."}

Accepted for publication in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A", "summary": "Dark matter haloes are typically characterised by radial density profiles with fixed forms motivated by simulations (e.g. NFW). However, simulation predictions depend on uncertain dark matter physics and baryonic modelling. Here, we present a method to constrain halo density profiles directly from observations using Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR), a technique that searches the space of analytic expressions for the function that best balances accuracy and simplicity for a given dataset. We test the approach on mock weak lensing excess surface density (ESD) data of synthetic clusters with NFW profiles. Motivated by real data, we assign each ESD data point a constant fractional uncertainty and vary this uncertainty and the number of clusters to probe how data precision and sample size affect model selection. For fractional errors around 5%, ESR recovers the NFW profile even from samples as small as 20 clusters. At higher uncertainties representative of current surveys, simpler functions are favoured over NFW, though it remains competitive. This preference arises because weak lensing errors are smallest in the outskirts, causing the fits to be dominated by the outer profile. ESR therefore provides a robust, simulation-independent framework both for testing mass models and determining which features of a halo's density profile are genuinely constrained by the data."}

Two of its remarkable features are (i) inflation can be realized even by very steep potentials and (ii) such a scenario doesn't call for a separate post-inflation reheating phase. We exploit the first feature to show that Warm Inflation can successfully take place on the very steep left wing of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential while remaining in excellent agreement with current cosmological data (joint analysis of Planck, ACT and DESI). The Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential has a flatter right wing as well, which opens up the possibility of dark energy when the field rolls along this wing. However in order to successfully realize quintessential inflation one needs to (i) normalize the two wings of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential differently in order to bridge between the two extreme energy scales of inflation and dark energy, (ii) allow the quintessence field to be dissipative, which is consistent with the presence of a dissipative term in warm inflation. The dissipative dynamics of the quintessence field is needed in order to sustain slow-roll in the right wing. With these modifications, we demonstrate that the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential can give rise to a unified model of warm inflation (on the left wing) and transient dark energy (on the right wing)."}

This represents the highest-significance pairwise kSZ measurement to date. The analysis uses three ACT CMB temperature maps: co-added 150 GHz, total frequency maps, and a component-separated Internal Linear Combination (ILC) map, all of which cover 19,000 square degrees of the sky from Advanced ACTPol observations conducted between 2017 and 2022. Comparison of the results of these three maps serves as a consistency check for potential foreground contamination that may depend on the observation frequency. An estimate of the best-fit mass-averaged optical depth is obtained by comparing the pairwise kSZ curve with the linear-theory prediction of the pairwise velocity under the best-fit Planck cosmology, and is compared with predictions from simulations. This estimate serves as a reference point for future comparisons with thermal SZ-derived optical depth measurements for the same DESI cluster samples, which will be presented in a companion paper. Finally, we employ a machine-learning approach trained on simulations to estimate the optical depth for 456,803 DESI LRG-identified clusters within the simulated mass range (greater than about 1e13 solar masses). These are combined with the measured kSZ signal to infer the individual cluster peculiar velocities, providing the opportunity to constrain the behavior of gravity and the dark sector over a range of cosmic scales and epochs."}

Starting from the Einstein-Hilbert action in a flat FLRW background, we derive the modified Friedmann and Klein Gordon equations incorporating this coupling. Using the Fermi-Dirac integrals, we account for the continuous transition of neutrinos from relativistic to non-relativistic regimes. The inflationary dynamics are analyzed via the slow roll parameters derived from the effective potential. Our results show that the scalar neutrino coupling alters the potential slope and curvature, thereby influencing the duration of inflation. The hybrid coupling form provides the most flexible realization, unifying neutrino mass generation with early universe inflation within a single scalar field framework."}

We start using the present-day photon density as an anchor, and use the baryon-to-photon ratio from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis based measurements and the baryon-to-matter ratio from the baryons' imprint on galaxy clustering to translate to a physical matter density at present day. We then compare this to measurements of the ratio of the matter density to the critical density ($Ω_{\\mathrm{m}}$), calculated using the relative positions of the baryon acoustic oscillations, to measure the critical density of the universe and hence $H_0$. The important measurements of the evolution of the energy density all happen at low redshift, so we consider this a low-redshift measurement. We validate our method both on a suite of $N$-body mocks and on noiseless theory vectors generated across a wide range of Hubble parameters in both $Λ$CDM and EDE cosmologies. Using DESI DR1 data combined with the angular CMB acoustic scale and the latest BBN constraints, we find $H_0 = 69.0 \\pm 2.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, consistent with existing early and late-time determinations of the Hubble constant. We consider the impact of non-standard dark energy evolution on our measurement.

This produces a different pre-recombination distribution of baryons and dark matter. After recombination, the gravitational potential responds to both components in proportion to their mass, allowing robust measurement of the baryon fraction. This is independent of new-physics scenarios altering the recombination background (e.g. Early Dark Energy). The accuracy of such measurements does, however, depend on how baryons and CDM are modeled in the power spectrum. Previous template-based splitting relied on approximate transfer functions that neglected part of information. We present a new method that embeds an extra parameter controlling the balance between baryons and dark matter in the growth terms of the perturbation equations in the CAMB Boltzmann solver. This approach captures the baryonic suppression of CDM prior to recombination, avoids inconsistencies, and yields a clean parametrization of the baryon fraction in the linear power spectrum, separating out the simple physics of growth due to the combined matter potential. We implement this framework in an analysis pipeline using Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure with HOD-informed priors and validate it against noiseless LCDM and EDE cosmologies with DESI-like errors. The new scheme achieves comparable precision to previous splitting while reducing systematic biases, providing a more robust way to baryon-fraction measurements. In combination with BBN constraints on the baryon density and Alcock-Paczynski estimates of the matter density, these results strengthen the use of baryon fraction measurements to derive a Hubble constant from energy densities, with future DESI and Euclid data expected to deliver competitive constraints."}

Furthermore, the data suggest that the equation of state may have been in the phantom regime in the distant past, recently undergoing a phantom crossing. In this work, we investigate whether this preference can be realized within a kinetically mixed axion-dilaton (KMIX) quintessence model, a string-motivated system in which an axion-like field couples exponentially to a dilaton-like (moduli) field. Crucially, KMIX can appear phantom in a standard Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) based analysis. To confront the model with data, we develop a fast pipeline based on normalizing flows that (i) learns a theory-informed prior on $(w_0,w_a)$ from KMIX realizations and (ii) provides an inverse mapping from CPL parameters back to the physical KMIX parameters. By importance-sampling pre-computed CPL chains using this framework, we effectively transform generic phenomenological constraints into direct, computationally efficient constraints on the underlying KMIX theory, avoiding the prohibitive cost of full parameter space exploration. Applied to Planck+DESI DR2 BAO measurements, our framework finds support for KMIX at $2.5σ$ compared to the base CPL fit at $3.1σ$, demonstrating that KMIX may account for the DESI preference without invoking true phantom behavior. When additionally including Type Ia supernovae data, we find that the preference remains above $3σ$ for Union3 and DES Y5, but drops to $2.1σ$ with Pantheon+. The latter, combined with the DESI full-shape power spectrum and bispectrum data, further reduces the preference to $1.7σ$. Ultimately, should the DESI deviation persist with future data, KMIX may offer a theoretically well-motivated explanation for the phantom-like signatures inferred from phenomenological fits."}

This makes it crucial to deeply understand the behaviour of our analysis pipelines. A counterintuitive feature of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) second data release is that restricting the dataset to the last 10.3 years (DR2new) increases the inferred GWB significance from $\\leq2σ$ for the full 25-year dataset (DR2full) to $\\geq3.5σ$. We investigate whether this behaviour indicates an anomaly or is a possible outcome of the pipeline. Using realistic, DR2-like simulations with varying timespans, we find that the first 10 years contribute little to the GWB evidence due to their limited frequency coverage. This produces substantial overlap between the HD S/N distributions of DR2full and DR2new. Random noise fluctuations therefore yield a higher GWB evidence in DR2new than in DR2full in $15\\%$ of cases. Furthermore, $5\\%$ of simulations match the HD S/N of the real data, indicating that the observed behaviour is consistent with being a $\\sim2σ$ outcome due to noise fluctuations. Regardless of significance, DR2new simulations introduce biases in the GWB parameter estimation due to spectral leakage effects that are ignored in standard analyses and which flatten the inferred spectrum. Including leakage removes these biases, demonstrating the reliability of DR2new when the signal is properly modelled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that combining EPTA DR2full with long-baseline data from NANOGrav and PPTA, as well as low-frequency data from LOFAR and NenuFAR, significantly enhances GWB evidence and parameter accuracy. Finally, we examine the impact of the observation timespan and find that short-baseline datasets introduce strong amplitude biases and are ineffective at constraining the GWB."}

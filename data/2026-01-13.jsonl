In this work, we investigate this \"back-reaction\" of baryons on dark matter using thousands of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) project, including parameter variations in the SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, ASTRID, and Swift-EAGLE galaxy formation models. Matching haloes to corresponding N-body (dark matter-only) simulations, we find that virial masses decrease owing to the ejection of baryons by feedback. Relative to N-body simulations, halo profiles show an increased dark matter density in the center (due to radiative cooling) and a decrease in density farther out (due to feedback), with both effects being strongest in SIMBA (> 450% increase at r < 0.01 Rvir). The clustering of dark matter strongly responds to changes in baryonic physics, with dark matter power spectra in some simulations from each model showing as much as 20% suppression or increase in power at k ~ 10 h/Mpc relative to N-body simulations. We find that the dark matter back-reaction depends intrinsically on cosmology (Omega_m and sigma_8) at fixed baryonic physics, and varies strongly with the details of the feedback implementation. These results emphasize the need for marginalizing over uncertainties in baryonic physics to extract cosmological information from weak lensing surveys as well as their potential to constrain feedback models in galaxy evolution."}

Using observationally anchored mass-radius relations and a density profile consistent with established equations of state, we construct a piecewise model that explicitly integrates the neutron-drip line, nuclear-saturation, the electron-dominated halo, and core-crust interfaces. The resulting structure reproduces the stiffness and curvature behavior across the nuclear-pasta regime reported in the literature, validating our treatment of the crust-core transition. From this model, we derive updated moments of inertia, crustal mass fractions, and the effective number of neutrons contributing to the star's magnetic moment. Comparing these quantities with spin-down inferred magnetic dipole moments indicates that the observed magnetic fields of particularly millisecond pulsars can be sustained entirely by the crustal neutron polarization, requiring alignment of only about $\\lesssim5.5\\%$ ($99\\%$ C.L.) of the neutrons in the crust. This finding supports a crust-confined magnetic-field origin for non-magnetar neutron stars, consistent with magneto-thermal evolution studies, and provides a quantitative framework for connecting neutron-star observables to its underlying structure."}

Comparing the numerical results from the AbacusSummit of cosmological simulations, we derive a non-parametric model for the redshift asymmetry distribution of void galaxies, which turns out to be almost universally valid for a very broad range of cosmologies including dynamic dark energy models with time-dependent equation of states as well as the $Λ$CDM models with various initial conditions. We discover that the universality of this model breaks down only if the running of scalar spectral index deviates from zero, detecting a consistent trend that a more positive (negative) running yields a lower (higher) redshift asymmetry of voids than the model predictions. Given that non-standard inflations usually predict non-zero runnings of the spectral index and that the redshift asymmetry distribution of voids is a readily observable quantity, we conclude that this new diagnostics will pave another path toward understanding the true mechanism of inflation."}

We show that in the outer disk (radii $R \\gtrsim 0.01\\,$pc or $\\gtrsim 1000\\,R_{G}$), models supported by thermal or radiation pressure predict disk masses which are much larger than the BH mass and increase with radius - i.e. rapidly-rising, extremely non-Keplerian rotation curves. More generally, we show that any observational upper limit to the deviation from Keplerian potentials at these radii directly constrains the physical form of the pressure in disks. We then show that existing maser and broad line region (BLR) kinematic observations immediately rule out the classic thermal-pressure-dominated Shakura Sunyaev-like $α$-disk model, and indeed rule out any thermal or radiation (or cosmic-ray) pressure-dominated disk, as the required temperatures and luminosities of the gas at large radii would exceed those observed by orders of magnitude. We show that models where the pressure comes entirely from turbulence (without thermal, radiation, or magnetic sources) could in principle be viable but would require turbulent Toomre $Q \\gtrsim 100$, far larger than predicted by self gravitating/gravito-turbulent models. However, recently proposed models of magnetic pressure-dominated disks agree with all of the observational constraints. These magnetically-dominated models also appear to agree better with constraints on maser magnetic fields, compared to the other possibilities. Observations appear to strongly favor the hypothesis that the outer regions of BH accretion disks are in the 'hyper-magnetized' state."}

SN~2012au is a particularly intriguing SESN in this regard as observations obtained $\\gtrsim$ 6 years post-explosion have shown \\emph{both} (i) optical emission features consistent with a young PWN and (ii) a radio re-brightening. We present the results of our Very-Long-Baseline-Interferometric (VLBI) observations of SN 2012au performed between 8 to 13 years post core-collapse. Our VLBI observations reveal a luminous, steadily fading radio source that remains compact ($\\leq1.4\\times10^{17}~\\mathrm{cm}$) and stationary ($\\leq0.36c$) over the course of our campaign. Overall, we find that our VLBI measurements can be readily explained by a $\\sim$decade-old PWN, potentially explained by shock interaction with specific CSM geometries, and are unlikely to be explained by emission from an off-axis, relativistic jet. Assuming a PWN origin, our observations require that the initial spin-down luminosity of the central pulsar be between $10^{36}~\\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}\\leq\\dot{E}_0\\leq10^{42}~\\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$ and radio efficiency factor be $η_\\mathrm{R}\\geq3\\times10^{-6}$.

The possible presence of a significant dark matter component in the form of primordial black holes suggests that dark halo formation simulations should be commenced well before redshift z = 100. Unlike standard CDM candidates, PBHs behave as dense, non-relativistic matter from their inception in the radiation-dominated era. This allows them to seed gravitational potential wells and begin clustering earlier. We find that starting N-body simulations at redshifts even before matter-radiation equality yield galaxy bulk flow velocities that are systematically larger than those predicted by standard LCDM models. The early, high-mass concentrations established by PBHs lead to a more rapid and efficient gravitational acceleration of surrounding baryonic and dark matter, generating larger peculiar velocities that remain coherent over scales of hundreds of Mpc. Furthermore, a sub- population of PBHs in the 10^-20 to 10^-17 solar mass range would lose a non-negligible fraction of their mass via Hawking radiation over cosmological timescales. This evaporation process converts matter into radiation, so a time-varying matter density parameter, Omega_m', is introduced, which behaves like a boosted radiation term in the Friedmann equation. This dynamic term acts to reduce the Hubble tension. A higher effective Omega_r in the early universe reduces the sound horizon at the epoch of recombination. PBH mass loss also influences fits to the equation of state parameter, w, at low redshift. The naive N-body modelling presented here suggests investigation with tried and tested cosmology codes should be carried out, by introducing mass losing PBHs and starting the evolution as early as practicable."}

In the near future, extensions of the EHT such as the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) will allow access to finer-scale features, such as a black hole's ''photon ring.'' In the Kerr spacetime, this image structure arises from strong gravitational lensing near the black hole that results in a series of increasingly demagnified images of each emitting region that exponentially converge to a limiting critical curve. Exotic black hole alternatives, such as wormholes, can introduce additional photon rings. Hence, precisely characterizing multi-ring images is a promising pathway for measuring black hole parameters, such as spin, as well as exploring non-Kerr spacetimes. Here, we examine the interferometric response of multi-ring systems using a series of 1) simple geometric toy models, 2) synthetic BHEX and EHT observations of geometric models, and 3) semi-analytic accretion models with ray-tracing in the Kerr spacetime. We find that interferometric amplitude is more sensitive to the shape of the photon ring, while interferometric phase is more sensitive to its displacement, which is most sensitive to black hole spin. We find that for models similar to Messier 87* (M87*), the relative displacement of the first strongly lensed image from the weakly lensed direct image is approximately $1\\,μ{\\rm as}$ per unit dimensionless spin, yielding an expected phase signature on a 25 G$λ$ baseline of $\\sim44^\\circ$ per unit spin."}

Using a unified framework, we analyze two IDE models--coupled quintessence and coupled fluid--against the latest CMB (Planck, ACT, SPT), DESI BAO, and SN (including DES-Dovekie recalibrated) data. Both IDE scenarios show robust evidence for non-vanishing interactions at the 3-5$σ$ level, with marginalized constraints significantly deviating from the $Λ$CDM limit. This preference persists even under DES-Dovekie SN recalibration, which weakens dynamical DE evidence. Crucially, for the same number of free parameters, IDE models provide fits to low- and high-redshift data that match or exceed the performance of the CPL dynamical DE parametrization. Our results establish IDE as a physically motivated alternative to dynamical DE, highlighting the necessity of future cosmological perturbation measurements (e.g., weak lensing, galaxy clustering) to distinguish between these paradigms."}

While residual observational systematics and local-structure effects cannot be definitively excluded, this result motivates the exploration of alternative physical interpretations beyond the minimal $Λ$CDM framework. We investigate whether Scalar--Tensor--Vector Gravity (STVG-MOG) can provide a consistent explanation for an enhanced large-scale anisotropic dipole without violating existing constraints from early-universe cosmology, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole, galaxy dynamics, weak lensing, or the observed late-time matter power spectrum. The radio number-count dipole probes ultra-large-scale, anisotropic structure and coherent gravitational response, rather than virialized dynamics or linear growth alone. In STVG-MOG, a scale- and time-dependent effective gravitational coupling preserves standard cosmological evolution at early times and on small to intermediate scales, while amplifying gravitational response on gigaparsec scales. This scale-selective enhancement can increase the large-scale structure contribution to the radio dipole without overproducing power on smaller scales. If the observed dipole excess reflects a physical cosmological signal rather than residual systematics, STVG-MOG offers a viable and testable alternative interpretation. It is demonstrated that the radio dipole anomaly provides a novel probe of gravitational physics on the largest observable scales."}

As a concrete and theoretically controlled example, we focus on the Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant.

Since decades ago theorists have predicted that SNe II-P may originate not only from single stars but also from interacting binaries. While ~20 SNII-P progenitors have been directly detected on pre-explosion images, observational evidence still remains scarce for this speculated binary progenitor channel. In this work, we report the discovery of a red supergiant progenitor for the Type II-P SN 2018gj. While the progenitor resembles those of other SNe II-P in terms of effective temperature and luminosity, it is located in a very old environment and SN 2018gj has an abnormally short plateau in the light curve. With state-of-the-art binary evolution simulations, we find these characteristics can only be explained if the progenitor of SN 2018gj is the merger product of a close binary system, which developed a different interior structure and evolved over a longer timescale compared with single-star evolution. This work provides the first compelling evidence for the long-sought binary progenitor channel toward SNe II-P, and our methodology serves as an innovative and pragmatic tool to motivate further investigations into this previously hidden population of SNe II-P from binaries."}

In recent years, scalar-induced GWs have attracted significant attention because they may serve as the observational signature of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early universe. The formation of PBHs requires large density perturbations, which can naturally emerge in some models of inflation. When these large density fluctuations couple, they act as a source for scalar-induced GWs at second order. In this work, we extend the existing formalism by including linear tensor fluctuations as an additional source term. This gives rise to two new classes of second-order GWs: those sourced by scalar-tensor couplings (scalar-tensor induced GWs) and those quadratic in tensor modes (tensor-tensor induced GWs). We find that the scalar-tensor contribution becomes significant if first-order tensor modes are enhanced, whilst the tensor-tensor contribution remains subdominant. Moreover, we demonstrate that the spectrum of scalar-tensor induced GWs exhibits an unphysical enhancement in the UV limit when the primordial scalar power spectrum is insufficiently peaked. To investigate whether this can be resolved, we study third-order induced GWs and their correlation with primordial GWs. We find that this new contribution suppresses the overall signal but does not cancel the unphysical enhancement. Possible explanations for this behaviour are discussed and left for future work. Finally, we explore the effect of primordial scalar non-Gaussianity on the spectrum of scalar-tensor induced GWs, building on previous results showing its impact on scalar-induced GWs."}

To be published in the Proceedings of Science https://pos.sissa.it/493/", "summary": "Dwarf Novae and low-mass X-ray binaries are eruptive binary systems comprised of a Roche-lobe overflowing solar-type star and an accreting compact object. Their recurrence time can be explained by a low-accreting phase, the quiescence, during which the angular momentum transport parameter is inferred to be $α\\approx 0.01$ by the Disc Instability Model. Non-magnetics mechanisms, such as spiral wave transport, only achieve angular momentum transport an order of magnitude too low, at best, because these discs are so thin in quiescence. During this phase, the Magneto-rotational Instability is known to be suppressed by the increased resistivity of the weakly ionised plasma. Studying these thin magnetised discs is a numerical challenge because of the wide range of scales to be resolved. Thanks to the new GPU-accelerated code Idefix, we produce global 3D MHD simulations of a very thin disc $(H/R = 0.01)$ for the first time. We explore the possibility that an MHD wind arises and increases accretion in low magnetic Reynolds number $(\\mathrm{Rm}\\approx100)$ and realistic plasma parameter ($β\\approx 1000$) regimes. We observe that the MRI is only quenched in the resistive disc bulk but survives in the disc atmosphere. This drives strong accretion and wind launching. We quantify the efficiency of the resulting wind and measure its global effect on the disc. We explore the effect of the initial disc magnetisation and compare the accretion/ejection regime with and without resistivity."}

In case of a detection, it will be crucial to distinguish the possible sources of this GWB. One under-explored possibility is to exploit the duty cycle that quantifies the number of sources present in the time domain signal, which can be very different depending on the nature and population of the sources. We compute the duty cycle for a realistic population of PBH binaries, isolating the shot-noise, popcorn and continuous contributions to the GWB. We identify the dependence of the duty cycle on the signal frequency, duration and amplitude as a crucial metric for distinguishing PBHs from other sources in the GWB and constraining PBH models.

Vishniac", "Amir Jafari"], "title": "The Structure of Poloidal Fields Embedded in Thin Disks", "comment": "Submitted to APJ; comments welcome!", "summary": "Many accreting systems are modeled as geometrically thin disks. Simulations of accretion disks cannot be extended to this regime, although local models can address the behavior of narrow annuli. A global model needs to account for the interactions between a large-scale poloidal field, accreted from the environment, and the disk. The disk magnetosphere can be modeled subject to the boundary conditions imposed by the disk. These depend on the structure of the magnetic field as it crosses the disk and the degree to which the disk can support a bend in the field lines. Building on earlier work we derive a set of equations describing a stationary disk with an embedded poloidal field. We derive a modified induction equation that incorporates tensorial turbulent diffusivities and a helicity-regulated $α$-effect. We quantify how helicity conservation introduces a nonlinear backreaction on the large-scale dynamo, dynamically coupling turbulent diffusion and $α$-quenching. We discuss the challenges encountered in finding a unique solution under stationary flows $E_φ=0$, which balances the inflow of $B_z$ due to accretion, the outflow due to radial diffusion of $B_z$, and the vertical movement of $B_r$ due to turbulent diffusion and buoyancy. The vertical profiles of both the azimuthal diffusion coefficient $D_{ijk}$ and the helicity-driven $α_{ij}$ demonstrate that changes in the radial gradient can restructure the magnetic field geometry. The ability of disks to sustain large bending angles in the poloidal field implies that angular momentum flux through the magnetosphere can dominate over internal transport even for weak fields. Competing factors can result in non-unique solutions, necessitating extra constraints and diagnostics that highlight the role of isotropic turbulence and helicity regulation in magnetized disk environments."}

Our IA implementation in the Flagship simulation takes into account photometric properties of galaxies as well as their dark matter host halos. We compare simulations against theory predictions, determining the parameters of two of the most widely used IA models: the Non Linear Alignment (NLA) and the Tidal Alignment and Tidal Torquing (TATT) models. We measure the amplitude of the simulated IA signal as a function of galaxy magnitude and colour in the redshift range $0.1<z<2.1$. We find that both NLA and TATT can accurately describe the IA signal in the simulation down to scales of $6$-$7 \\,h^{-1}\\,$Mpc. We measure alignment amplitudes for red galaxies comparable to those of the observations, with samples not used in the calibration procedure. For blue galaxies, our constraints are consistent with zero alignments in our first redshift bin $0.1 < z < 0.3$, but we detect a non-negligible signal at higher redshift, which is, however, consistent with the upper limits set by observational constraints. Additionally, several hydrodynamical simulations predict alignment for spiral galaxies, in agreement with our findings. Finally, the evolution of alignment with redshift is realistic and comparable to that determined in the observations. However, we find that the commonly adopted redshift power-law for IA fails to reproduce the simulation alignments above $z=1.1$. A significantly better agreement is obtained when a luminosity dependence is included, capturing the intrinsic luminosity evolution with redshift in magnitude-limited surveys. We conclude that the Flagship IA simulation is a useful tool for translating current IA constraints into predictions for IA contamination of Euclid-like samples."}

However, our understanding of magnetars remains highly limited, constrained by observational sample size and radiative variability. XTE~J1810$-$197, which re-entered a radio-active phase in 2018, is one of only six known radio-pulsating magnetars. Leveraging the distinctive capability for simultaneous dual-frequency observations, we utilized the Shanghai Tianma Radio Telescope (TMRT) to monitor this magnetar continuously at both 2.25 and 8.60~GHz, capturing its entire evolution from radio activation to quenching. This enabled precise characterization of the evolution in its integrated profile, spin frequency, flux density, and spectral index ($α$, defined by $S \\propto f^α$). The first time derivative of its spin frequency $\\dotν$ passed through four distinct phases -- rapid decrease, violent oscillation, steady decline, and stable recovery -- before returning to its pre-outburst value concomitant with the cessation of radio emission. Remarkably, both the amplitudes and the characteristic time-scales of these $\\dotν$ variations match those observed during the previous outburst that began in 2003, providing the first demonstration that post-outburst rotational evolution and radiative behavior in a magnetar are repeatable. A twisted-magnetosphere model can qualitatively account for this repeatability as well as for the progressive narrowing and abrupt disappearance of the radio pulse radiation, thereby receiving strong observational support."}

At large angular scales, the Pierre Auger Observatory has reported a significant dipole modulation in right ascension, while at intermediate angular scales, localized flux excesses have been identified by both the Auger and Telescope Array collaborations. These observations were investigated in the first two papers of this series. Aims. We examine the implications of these anisotropy measurements and assess to what extent they can be used to constrain the origin of UHECRs and the astrophysical or physical parameters of viable source scenarios.\n  Methods. As in the first two papers of this series, we generate realistic UHECR sky maps for a wide range of astrophysical models consistent with current spectral and composition constraints, assuming that UHECR sources trace the distribution of galaxies in the Universe. We update our previous studies by incorporating the most recent models of the Galactic magnetic field and apply the same large- and intermediate-scale anisotropy analyses as those used by the Auger Collaboration to simulated datasets with current experimental exposure.\n  Results. The main novelty of this third paper is the improved compatibility between simulations and data, in particular regarding the reconstructed dipole direction, when using several of the recently proposed Galactic magnetic field models. Despite this progress, our main conclusions remain unchanged: although the observed anisotropies are compatible with an extragalactic origin of UHECRs, present data and magnetic-field uncertainties do not allow strong constraints to be placed on the nature, spatial distribution, or density of UHECR sources.\n  Conclusions. Further progress in the interpretation of UHECR anisotropies will require improved constraints on cosmic magnetic fields, advances in source modeling, and significantly larger experimental exposures"}

Spatial correlations between thermal dust and ionized carbon emission in Planck HFI and COBE-DIRBE", "comment": "9 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "We fit five tracers of thermal dust emission to ten Planck HFI and COBE-DIRBE frequency maps between 353 GHz and 25 THz, aiming to map the relative importance of each physical host environment as a function of frequency and position on the sky. Four of these correspond to classic thermal dust tracers, namely H i (HI4PI), CO (Dame et al. 2001a), Hα (WHAM, Haffner et al. (2003a, 2016)), and dust extinction (Gaia; Edenhofer et al. 2024), while the fifth is ionized carbon (C ii) emission as observed by COBE- FIRAS. We jointly fit these five templates to each frequency channel through standard multi-variate linear regression. At frequencies higher than 1 THz, we find that the dominant tracer is in fact C ii, and above 10 THz this component accounts for almost the entire fitted signal; at frequencies below 1 THz, its importance is second only to H i. We further find that all five components are well described by a modified blackbody spectral energy density (SED) up to some component-dependent maximum frequency ranging between 1 and 5 THz. In this interpretation, the C ii-correlated component is the hottest among all five, with an effective temperature of about 25 K. The Hα component has a temperature of 18 K, and, unlike the other four, is observed in absorption rather than emission. Despite the simplicity of this model, which relies only on external templates coupled to spatially isotropic SEDs, we find that it captures 98 % of the full signal root mean squared (RMS) below 1 THz. This high efficiency suggests that spatial variations in the thermal dust SED, as for instance reported by Planck and other experiments, may be more economically modelled on large angular scales in terms of a spatial mixing of individually isotropic physical components."}

Here, we used over 1000 observations to study the broadband X-ray spectra of a sample of five CSAGNs, spanning three orders of magnitude in Eddington ratio ($λ_{\\rm Edd}$), using phenomenological models to trace the evolution of key spectral components. We derive several fundamental parameters, such as the photon index, soft excess strength, reflection strength, and luminosities of the soft excess and primary continuum. We find that the soft excess and primary continuum emissions show a very strong positive correlation ($p \\ll 10^{-10}$), suggesting a common physical origin. The soft excess strength does not show any dependency on the reflection parameter, suggesting that in these objects the soft excess is not dominated by a blurred ionized reflection process. On the other hand, the strength of the soft excess is found to be strongly positively correlated with the Eddington ratio ($p \\ll 10^{-10}$), and we find that the soft excess vanishes below $\\log λ_{\\rm Edd} \\sim -2.5$. Moreover, we find a clear `V'-shaped relation for $Γ-λ_{\\rm Edd}$, with a break at $\\log λ_{\\rm Edd} = -2.47 \\pm 0.09$. Our findings indicate a change in the geometry of the inner accretion flow at low Eddington ratios, and that the soft excess is primarily produced via warm Comptonization."}

Following a companion analysis of Planck HFI, the four components of this model correspond to \"hot dust\", \"cold dust\", \"nearby dust\", and \"Halpha correlated dust\", respectively, and each component is modelled in terms of a fixed spatial template and a spatially isotropic spectral energy density (SED) defined by an overall free amplitude for each DIRBE channel. Except for the cold dust amplitude, which is only robustly detected in the 240 micron channel, we measure statistically significant template amplitudes for all components in all DIRBE channels between 12 and 240 micron. In the 3.5 and 4.9 micron channels, only the hot component is detected, while the 1.25 and 2.2 micron channels are too dominated by starlight emission to allow robust dust detections. The total number of DIRBE-specific degrees of freedom in this model is 25. Despite this low dimensionality, the resulting total SED agrees well with recent astrodust predictions. At both low and high frequencies, more than 95 % of the frequency map variance is captured by the model, while at 60 and 100 micron about 70 % of the signal variance is successfully accounted for. The hot dust component, which in a companion paper has been found to correlate strongly with C ii emission, has the highest absolute amplitude in all DIRBE frequency channels; in particular, at 3.5 micron, which is known to be dominated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission, this component accounts for at least 80 % of the total signal. This analysis represents an important step towards establishing a joint concordance model of thermal dust emission applicable to both the microwave and infrared regimes."}

The star clusters, recently observed in gamma-rays, are also known sources of non-thermal X-ray emission, which is due to synchrotron or inverse-Compton scattering of relativistic electrons. Thus, the search for the non-thermal X-ray emission from stellar clusters is of particular interest. Until recent time the X-ray emission of the Arches star cluster in the Galactic Center was mixed with non-thermal emission of the surrounding molecular cloud, associated with reflection of hard X-ray irradiation. This reflected emission has been observed to fade, giving us a chance to characterize intrinsic non-thermal emission of the Arches cluster. In this work we demonstrate that Fe K_alpha line emission at 6.4 keV, attributed to the reflected non-thermal emission of the molecular cloud in 2000-2010, is not detected in deep observations with XMM-Newton in 2020 and Chandra in 2022, leaving stellar cluster well isolated. We showed that the Arches non-thermal emission is localized in the cluster's core and characterized by a relatively weak, hard (Gamma~1.5) power-law spectral continuum with 2-10 keV flux of ~10E-13 ergs/s/cm^2."}

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "We investigate the temporal variability of polarization of synchrotron radiation from blazar jets. Multiwavelength observations revealed high-amplitude rotations of the electric vector position angle (EVPA), both in the optical and in the X-rays. More often, the polarization degree and the EVPA show a seemingly erratic variability. To interpret these observations, we present a geometric and deterministic model in which off-axis, compact emitting features (i.e.,~blobs) propagate along the jet with the local velocity of the flow. The dynamics of the blobs is determined by the jet electromagnetic fields, which are calculated self-consistently using an analytical model of magnetically dominated outflows. The jet is axisymmetric, and its electromagnetic fields do not have a turbulent component. We show that the observed polarization is sensitive to the initial spatial configurations of the blobs. For the same jet structure, we observe several remarkably complex polarization patterns, including large EVPA rotations of $180^{\\circ}$ or more in both directions and more erratic fluctuations. Simultaneous high-amplitude variations of the polarization degree and the EVPA can coincide with peaks of the observed luminosity. However, seemingly uncorrelated variations are also possible. We discuss the feasibility of constraining the particle acceleration mechanism from multifrequency polarimetric observations."}

Drawing an explicit parallel between axion field dynamics and synchronization in coupled oscillator systems, we show that a macroscopic axion phase can arise dynamically from initially incoherent configurations through gradient-driven ordering in an expanding Universe. In this framework, the misalignment angle is not a fundamental initial condition but a collective variable that becomes well defined only once phase coherence develops. Using a simple lattice model, we illustrate how the collective phase is selected prior to the onset of axion oscillations, providing a dynamical basis for the standard misalignment picture. This perspective offers a new way of organizing axion initial-condition sensitivity, reframes anthropic small-angle arguments in terms of phase-ordering efficiency, and suggests a broader connection between fine-tuning and emergent collective dynamics in the early Universe."}

In particular, the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A, which is well known for its asymmetric structure, contains three ``Fe-rich blobs,'' and the composition of the Fe-peak elements within these structures could be related to the asymmetry of the supernova explosion. We report a highly asymmetric distribution of the Fe-peak elements in Cassiopeia A as revealed by XRISM observations. We found that the southeastern Fe-rich region has a significant Mn emission above the 4$σ$ confidence level, while the northwestern Fe-rich region has no clear signature. In addition to the significant difference in Mn abundance across these regions, our observations show that the Ti/Fe, Mn/Cr, and Ni/Fe ratios vary from region to region. The observed asymmetric distribution of Fe-peak elements could be produced by (1) the mixing of materials from different burning layers of the supernova, (2) the asymmetric distribution of the electron fraction in the progenitor star and/or (3) the local dependence of the neutrino irradiation in the supernova innermost region. Future spatially resolved spectroscopy of Cassiopeia A using X-ray microcalorimeters will enable more detailed measurements of the distribution and composition of these elements, providing a unique tool for testing asymmetric supernova physics."}

We show that in the outer disk (radii $R \\gtrsim 0.01\\,$pc or $\\gtrsim 1000\\,R_{G}$), models supported by thermal or radiation pressure predict disk masses which are much larger than the BH mass and increase with radius - i.e. rapidly-rising, extremely non-Keplerian rotation curves. More generally, we show that any observational upper limit to the deviation from Keplerian potentials at these radii directly constrains the physical form of the pressure in disks. We then show that existing maser and broad line region (BLR) kinematic observations immediately rule out the classic thermal-pressure-dominated Shakura Sunyaev-like $α$-disk model, and indeed rule out any thermal or radiation (or cosmic-ray) pressure-dominated disk, as the required temperatures and luminosities of the gas at large radii would exceed those observed by orders of magnitude. We show that models where the pressure comes entirely from turbulence (without thermal, radiation, or magnetic sources) could in principle be viable but would require turbulent Toomre $Q \\gtrsim 100$, far larger than predicted by self gravitating/gravito-turbulent models. However, recently proposed models of magnetic pressure-dominated disks agree with all of the observational constraints. These magnetically-dominated models also appear to agree better with constraints on maser magnetic fields, compared to the other possibilities. Observations appear to strongly favor the hypothesis that the outer regions of BH accretion disks are in the 'hyper-magnetized' state."}

From these high-resolution simulations, we compute the non-thermal emission from this system and compare it to corresponding observations. We modelled the LS 5039 system assuming a wind-driven scenario. Our numerical model uses a joint simulation of the dynamical wind interaction together with the transport of energetic leptons from the shocked pulsar wind. We computed the non-thermal emission from this system in a post-processing step from the resulting distribution of energetic leptons. In this computation, we took into account the synchrotron and inverse Compton emission, relativistic beaming, and γγ-absorption in the stellar radiation field. We investigated the dynamical variation of the energetic particle spectra on both orbital and on short timescales. Our model successfully reproduces many of the spectral features of LS 5039. We also find a better correspondence between our predicted orbital light curves and the corresponding observations in soft x-rays, low-energy, and high-energy gamma rays than in our previous modelling efforts. We find that our high-resolution and large-scale simulations can successfully capture the relevant parts of the wind-collision region that are related to particle acceleration and emission of non-thermal radiation. The quality of the fit strengthens the wind-driven assumption underlying our model. Desirable extensions for the future include a dynamical magnetic-field model for the synchrotron regime, a revision of our injection parameters, and a consideration of an additional hadronic component that could explain recent observations in the 100~TeV regime."}

Using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, we analyze the local stellar environments of a volume-limited sample (z < 0.02) of 31 SNe IIn. The environments of SNe IIn are found to be very diverse; the SN could reside within a star-forming region (Class 1), outside a star-forming region (Class 2), or in much older environments without any obvious signs of star formation (Class 3). The bright SNe IIn (Mpeak < -19.5 mag) predominantly occur in Class 1 environments, indicative of very massive progenitors, while the faint SNe IIn (Mpeak < -15.5 mag) are associated with Classes 2 and 3 environments, suggesting the least massive progenitors. Meanwhile, normal SNe IIn with -19.5 < Mpeak < -15.5 mag occur in all three types of environments, suggesting a diversity in their progenitor mass, lifetime, and evolutionary pathways. Moreover, the directly detected SN IIn progenitors are systematically brighter and/or bluer than the youngest stellar populations in their environments, suggesting that they were either in a non-quiescent state when observed or had experienced binary interactions. These results point to a significantly diverse origin for progenitors of SNe IIn, spanning a wide range of masses, evolutionary stages, and potential binary interaction histories."}

Clark", "Serena Valtolina", "Lars Nieder", "Rutger van Haasteren"], "title": "Timing Gamma-ray Pulsars using Gibbs Sampling", "comment": "14 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "Timing analyses of gamma-ray pulsars in the Fermi Large Area Telescope data set can provide sensitive probes of many astrophysical processes, including timing noise in young pulsars, orbital period variations in redback binaries, and the stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). These goals can require careful accounting of stochastic noise processes, but existing methods developed to achieve this in radio pulsar timing analyses cannot be immediately applied to the discrete gamma-ray arrival time data. To address this, we have developed a new method for timing gamma-ray pulsars, in which the timing model fit is transformed into a weighted least squares problem by randomly assigning each photon to an individual Gaussian component of a template pulse profile. These random assignments are then numerically marginalised over through a Gibbs sampling scheme. This method allows for efficient estimation of timing and noise model parameters, while taking into account uncertainties in the pulse profile shape. We simulated Fermi-LAT data sets for gamma-ray pulsars with power-law timing noise processes, showing that this method provides robust estimates of timing noise parameters. We also describe a Gaussian-process model for orbital period variations in black-widow and redback binary systems that can be fit using this new timing method. We demonstrate this method on the black-widow binary millisecond pulsar B1957+20, where the orbital period varies significantly over the LAT data, but which provides one of the most stringent gamma-ray upper limits on the GWB."}

The joint detection of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves would provide insight into cosmic processes, from the dynamics of compact object mergers and stellar collapses to the mechanisms driving relativistic outflows. The joint detection of multiple cosmic messengers can also elevate the significance of the common observation even when some or all of the constituent messengers are sub-threshold, i.e. not significant enough to declare their detection individually. Using data from the LIGO, Virgo, and IceCube observatories, including sub-threshold events, we searched for common sources of gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos during the third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Our search did not identify significant joint sources. We derive constraints on the rate densities of joint sources. Our results constrain the isotropic neutrino emission from gravitational-wave sources for very high values of the total energy emitted in neutrinos (> $10^{52} - 10^{54}$ erg)."}

Using a local interstellar spectrum from GALPROP constrained by Voyager data, we fit the model to time-resolved proton and antiproton fluxes measured by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer - 02 (AMS-02) during the solar-quiet period (May 2011 to June 2022). To enable rapid parameter scans, we employ neural-network-based surrogate models to compute propagation and modulation matrices efficiently. The results demonstrate that the model simultaneously describes the observed proton and antiproton fluxes with physically reasonable parameters, providing a unified account of charge-dependent modulation."}

Despite the extraordinary brightness, GECAM-C has accurately measured both the bright prompt emission and flare emission of GRB 221009A without instrumental effects, offering a good opportunity to study the relation between them. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of flare emission of GRB 221009A, which is composed of a series of flares. Among them, we identify an exceptionally bright flare with a record-breaking isotropic energy $E_{\\rm iso} = 1.82 \\times 10^{53}$ erg of GRB flares. It exhibits the highest peak energy ever detected in GRB flares, $E_{\\rm peak} \\sim 300$ keV, making it a genuine gamma-ray flare. It also shows rapid rise and decay timescales, significantly shorter than those of typical X-ray flares observed in soft X-ray or optical band, but comparable to those observed in prompt emissions. Despite these exceptional properties, the flare shares several common properties with typical GRB flares. We note that this is the first observation of a GRB flare in the keV-MeV band with sufficiently high temporal resolution and high statistics, which bridges the last gap between prompt emission and flare."}

The light curves show a photometric decline of $Δm_{15}(B) = 0.867 \\pm 0.051$~mag, characteristic of a slow-declining Type Ia supernova. After correcting for host galaxy extinction ($E(B-V)_{host} = 0.308 \\pm 0.030$~mag) and adopting a distance of 70~Mpc, we derive a peak absolute magnitude of $M_B = -19.13 \\pm 0.40$~mag. This luminosity is fully consistent with its slow decline rate, placing SN 2025bvm within the population of normal Type Ia supernovae. We conclude that SN 2025bvm is a normal Type Ia supernova, whose photometric properties, such as a slow late-time decline and a prominent \\iband-band secondary maximum, suggest an explosion that resulted in a particularly massive ejecta."}

Many critical physical processes, such as Roche lobe overflow,\nstrain modern simulation methods due to their durations and\nmultidimensionality. Aims. We employ a novel method of time-domain\nmultidimensional simulations to provide the first grid-based time domain 3D\nmodel of Roche lobe overflow using VH-1. Methods. Using a piecewise approach\nwhich alternates between high-resolution 3D dynamic modeling and\ncomputationally fast evolutionary modeling, we present and test a method\ncapable of self-scaling variable time resolution at greatly reduced\ncomputational cost. Results. We find mass transfer in the test high mass x-ray\nbinary M33 X-7 to be unstable and fully conservative in both mass and angular\nmomentum transport onto the accretion disk beyond f >~ 1.01. This phase begins\non thermal timescales and accelerates to span < 100 yrs beyond f >= 1.1, while\nthe non-conservative stable phase of f <~ 1.01 occurs on roughly nuclear\ntimescales. Conclusions. We identify a critical point f ~ 1.01 which terminates\nstable overflow, which may correspond to the point Mdot_L1 ~ Mdot_wind or\nMdot_L1 ~ 10^-6 M_solar/yr in the general case."}

Accepted for publication in MNRAS", "summary": "We investigate the optical shock emission from the Large Magellanic Cloud\nsupernova remnant 0540-69.3 (SNR 0540) using MUSE integral-field-unit data from\nthe VLT. The observations cover the spectral range 4650-9300 $\\r{A}$ and\nprovide a $1\\times1$ arcmin$^{2}$ field of view, encompassing nearly the entire\nremnant. We analyse the spatial and spectral properties of shock-related\nemission lines, and identify clumpy optical shock emission e.g. from [S II]\n$\\lambda\\lambda$6716,6731 doublet and the coronal [Fe XIV] $\\lambda$5303 line\n(typically at radial velocities $\\lesssim|100|$ km s$^{-1}$ and $\\lesssim|170|$\nkm s$^{-1}$, respectively). These features trace the blast-wave shell seen in\nprevious X-ray studies. Post-shock electron density estimates, based on the [S\nII]-line ratio, reveal spatial variation, with the highest densities\n($\\sim10^4$ cm$^{-3}$) in the bright knots in the west, and lower densities\n($\\sim3\\times10^3$ cm$^{-3}$) in the east. The density in the north (southwest)\nappears significantly lower (higher) but remains unconstrained due to limited\nsignal. We also estimate blast-wave shock velocities using the [Fe XIV]\n$\\lambda$5303/[Fe XI] $\\lambda$7892 ratio, finding low velocities ($\\sim400$ km\ns$^{-1}$), consistent with previous studies. All these results support the\nscenario that the blast wave is interacting with the surrounding interstellar\nmedium, particularly in the western regions. Additionally, we detect four\nunidentified emission lines, $\\sim$2000-3000 km s$^{-1}$ south from the pulsar\nin transverse velocity, but their origin remains unclear. Possible\nexplanations, including Fe lines from a high-velocity ejecta clump, all present\nchallenges. Our findings highlight the complex nature of the circum- and\ninterstellar medium surrounding SNR 0540."}

A realistic black hole continuum constructed from\ninitial mass and spin functions and approximate redshift evolution reveals\npossible black hole main sequences, such as sustained coherent accretion\nthrough cosmic time (i.e., Cosmic Accretion) or hierarchical merger trees.

The Australia\nTelescope Compact Array automatically triggered a 9-hour observation of GRB\n231117A at 5.5 and 9 GHz following its detection by the Neil Gehrels Swift\nObservatory just 1.3 hours post-burst. Splitting this observation into 1-hour\ntime bins, the early radio afterglow exhibited flaring, scintillating and\nplateau phases. The scintillation allowed us to place the earliest upper limit\n($<10$ hours) on the size of a GRB blast wave to date, constraining it to\n$<1\\times10^{16}$ cm. Multi-wavelength modeling of the full afterglow required\na period of significant energy injection between $\\sim 0.02$ and $1$ day. The\nenergy injection was modeled as a violent collision of two shells: a reverse\nshock passing through the injection shell explains the early radio plateau,\nwhile an X-ray flare is consistent with a shock passing through the leading\nimpulsive shell. Beyond 1 day, the blast wave evolves as a classic decelerating\nforward shock with an electron distribution index of $p=1.66\\pm0.01$. Our model\nalso indicates a jet-break at $\\sim2$ days, and a half-opening angle of\n$\\theta_j=16\\mathring{.}6 \\pm 1\\mathring{.}1$.

The minimum Lorentz factors this\nmodel requires are consistent with constraints from the early radio\nmeasurements of $\\Gamma>35$ to $\\Gamma>5$ between $\\sim0.1$ and $1$ day.

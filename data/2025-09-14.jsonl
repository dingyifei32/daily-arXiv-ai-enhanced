When contrasting the host stellar masses ($M_*$), specific star\nformation rates (sSFR), and host dust extinction ($A_V$) between\nspectroscopically and photometrically-classified SNe Ia, Ib/c, II, and IIn, we\ndetermine that deviations in these distributions are primarily due to\nmisclassified events contaminating the photometrically-classified sample. We\nfurther show that the higher redshifts of the photometrically-classified sample\nalso force their $M_*$ and sSFR distributions to deviate from those of the\nspectroscopically-classified sample, as these properties are\nredshift-dependent. We compare host properties between\nspectroscopically-classified SN populations and determine if they primarily\ntrace $M_*$ or SFR.

We derive intrinsic TDE\nproperties, such as SMBH and stellar masses, using MOSFiT and TDEMass, and\ncompare them with the ones of the sample population. Our population study\nreveals that AT2020mot agrees with the broader TDE sample in most physical\nproperties, including blackbody temperature, luminosity, and rise timescales.\nHowever, its optical polarisation degree is exceptionally high compared to the\nlow or undetected polarisation observed in other events.

Through the void galaxy cross correlation function,\ncosmic voids, the underdense regions in the galaxy distribution, are used for\nrefined deductions of the Universe's content by correcting apparent geometric\ndistortions. This study proposes a novel procedure for optimally extracting the\nAlcock Paczynski, AP, signal from cosmic voids through a cosmological\nreconstruction technique. Employing cosmological reconstruction, specifically\nusing the Zel'dovich approximation, we estimate the true positions of galaxies\nfrom their redshift space locations, reducing distortions introduced by\npeculiar velocities. Unlike previous analyses, we identify voids and measure\nthe void galaxy cross correlation function directly in reconstructed space.\nThis approach enables us, for the first time, to include in our analysis small\nnonlinear voids, typically discarded in previous studies, thus enhancing the\nstatistical power of void studies and significantly improving their\ncosmological constraining power. Reconstruction is particularly effective even\nat small scales for voids, due to their clean and dynamically simple\nenvironment. This ability to recover information encoded on small scales\nsignificantly enhances the precision of the analysis, leading to a 23 %\nimprovement in the constraints on the AP parameters compared to previous\nmethods where the analysis is performed in redshift space and, consequently, to\na better estimate of the derived cosmological parameters.

The most sensitive method of studying this\nproblem is observing the gamma--ray and neutrino diffuse fluxes produced in the\ninelastic interactions of CR protons and nuclei with interstellar gas that\nencode the energy and spatial distributions of the interacting particles. Most\ntheoretical models assume that the spatial and energy dependencies of the\nspectra of CR protons and nuclei are factorized, so that the CR energy spectra\nhave the same shape at all points of the Milky Way. However, on the base of the\nFermi--LAT observations, some authors have tentatively inferred that particles\nin the inner regions of the Milky Way have significantly harder spectra.\nRecently the ground--based telescopes Tibet--AS$\\gamma$, LHAASO and HAWC have\nextended the measurements of the diffuse gamma--ray flux to much higher\nenergies, and the IceCube neutrino telescope has obtained evidence for a $\\nu$\nflux from the Galactic disk. These new measurements allow for new tests of the\nfactorization hypothesis, and disfavor models in which the spectral shape of CR\nprotons and nuclei is harder in the inner part of the Galaxy. In fact, the\nLHAASO data above 30~TeV are in better agreement with the opposite hypothesis,\nthat cosmic rays is the inner Galaxy have softer spectra than those in the\nouter Galaxy. This result, that has currently only modest significance due to\nlarge statistical and systematic uncertainties, could be explained by assuming\nthat the CR confinement volume increases with energy.

As first studied in the context of the\nHubble tension in our previous paper, a larger $\\tau_{\\rm reio}$, which could\nbe achieved by removing the Planck low-$\\ell$ polarization data, could boost\n$H_0$ slightly, resulting in a mild reduction of the tension between the early-\nand late-universe determinations of $H_0$. It has been shown later that a\nlarger $\\tau_{\\rm reio}$ could also relieve other anomalies including: the\ntension between BAO and CMB data, the neutrino mass tension, and the latest\nDESI plus supernovae data's tension with the standard cosmological constant\nscenario. In this paper, we systematically analyze the correlations between\n$\\tau_{\\rm reio}$ and relevant cosmological parameters in the existing cosmic\nobservation anomalies. In addition to Pearson correlation coefficients\nextracted directly from the covariance matrix, we also study partial\ncorrelation coefficients which measure intrinsic relationships between pairs of\nparameters removing the influence of other parameters. We show that $\\tau_{\\rm\nreio}$ has weak intrinsic correlations with the parameters responsible for the\ntensions and anomalies discussed. The large direct Pearson correlations that\nallow larger $\\tau_{\\rm reio}$ inferences to alleviate the cosmological\ntensions each arise from complicated networks through multiple parameters. As a\nresult, the relationships between $\\tau_{\\rm reio}$ and each anomaly are not\nindependent of each other. We also employ our method of computing correlations\nto clarify the impact of large scale polarization data, and comment also on the\neffects of CMB observations from ACT and SPT."}

Efforts to reconstruct the processes that lead to\nmergers typically rely on either astrophysical models with fixed parameters, or\ncontinuous analytical models that can be fit to observations. Given the\ncomplexity of astrophysical formation mechanisms, these methods typically\ncannot fully take into account model uncertainties, nor can they fully capture\nthe underlying processes. Here, we present a merger population analysis that\ncan take a discrete set of simulated model distributions as its input to\ninterpret observations. The analysis can take into account multiple formation\nscenarios as fractional contributors to the total set of observations, and can\nnaturally account for model uncertainties. We apply this technique to\ninvestigate the origin of black hole mergers observed by LIGO Virgo.\nSpecifically, we consider a model of AGN assisted black hole merger\ndistributions, exploring a range of AGN parameters along with several {{SEVN}}\npopulation synthesis models that vary in common envelope efficiency parameter\n($\\alpha$) and metallicity ($Z$). We estimate the posterior distributions for\nAGN+SEVN models using $87$ BBH detections from the $O1--O3$ observation runs.\nThe inferred total merger rate is $46.2 {Gpc}^{-3} {yr}^{-1}$, with the AGN\nsub-population contributing $21.2{Gpc}^{-3}{yr}^{-1}$ and the SEVN\nsub-population contributing $25.0 {Gpc}^{-3} {yr}^{-1}$."}

Previous observational studies used the currently-observed global\ngas-phase metallicity of host galaxies, instead of $Z_{progenitor}$ used in the\nmodel, and showed a higher scatter in the $^{56}$Ni mass measurements compared\nto the model prediction. Here, we use $Z_{progenitor}$ of 34 normal SNe Ia and\nemploy recent SN Ia explosion models with various configurations to cover the\nobserved $^{56}$Ni mass range. Unlike previous studies, our sample covers the\n$Z_{progenitor}$ range, where most of the $Z_{progenitor}$ effect occurs.\nLinear regression returns a slope of 0.02+-0.03, which is the opposite trend to\nthe analytical model, but at at low statistical significance level. We find\nthat comparing our sample with SN Ia explosion models on the\n$Z_{progenitor}$--$^{56}$Ni mass diagram allows us to constrain the progenitor\nscenarios. We also explore other chemical composition indicators. For\n$(Fe/H)_{progenitor}$, our sample follows the trend predicted by the analytical\nmodels, but at a low significance level. Noticeably, $(\\alpha/Fe)_{progenitor}$\nshows the opposite trend and a clear gap. When we split the sample at\n$(\\alpha/Fe)_{progenitor}$ = 0.35 $(\\alpha/Fe)_{\\odot}$, we find a 3$\\sigma$\ndifference in the weighted-means of the $^{56}$Ni mass. Lastly, SNe Ia in\ndifferent $Z_{progenitor}$ groups show a difference of 0.14+-0.09 mag in the\nstandardized luminosity. The present work highlights a holistic approach (from\nthe progenitor star to the explosion with SN Ia and host galaxy observational\ndata) to understand the underlying physics of SNe Ia for more accurate and\nprecise cosmology."}

In this paper, we\nexplore the potential of the newest observations of diffuse emissions at the\nGalactic plane from HAWC and LHAASO to probe this kind of dark matter over a\nwide mass range. Here, we model secondary emissions (inverse-Compton) from the\nelectrons and positrons produced in the annihilation/decay of dark matter, on\ntop of their prompt $\\gamma$-ray emission, including the effects of absorption\nof high-energy photons via pair production. Furthermore, we show that including\nthe astrophysical backgrounds (namely diffuse emission from cosmic-ray\ncollisions or emission from unresolved sources) can significantly improve these\nlimits. We find that the new measurements provided, specially by LHAASO with\nthe combination of the WCDA and KM2A detectors, allow us to set strong\nconstraints in decaying dark matter, being competitive and even improving the\nstrongest constraints at the moment.

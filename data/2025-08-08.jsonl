Our analysis leverages an effective field theory (EFT)\ndescription of the 1D flux power spectrum, allowing us to analytically predict\nthe Lyman-$\\alpha$ fluctuations on quasi-linear scales from first principles.\nOur EFT-based likelihood enables robust inference across redshifts $z =\n4.2-5.4$ and down to scales of 100 kpc, within previously unexplored regions of\nparameter space for this dataset. We derive new bounds on the PBH fraction with\nrespect to the total dark matter $f_{\\text{PBH}}$, excluding populations with\n$f_{\\text{PBH}} \\gtrsim 10^{-3}$ for masses $M_{\\text{PBH}} \\sim 10^{4}-10^{16}\nM_{\\odot}$.

Due to their short durations and cosmological distances, their\ndispersion measure (DM) - redshift ($z$) relation is useful for constraining\ncosmological parameters and detecting the baryons in the Universe. The\nincreasing number of localized FRBs in recent years has provided more precise\nconstraints on these parameters. In this project, we collect 117 of the latest,\nlocalized FRBs, discuss the effect of a more accurate $\\sigma_{\\rm diff}$ in\nthe probability density function ($p_{\\rm diff}$) for ${\\rm DM}_{\\rm diff}$,\nand rewrite their likelihood convolution to better constrain the parameters\nabove. We find that the widely used approximation $\\sigma_{\\rm diff} \\sim\nF/\\sqrt{z}$ only works under contrived assumptions.

In rare cases the SN\nejecta interact with circumstellar material (CSM) that was ejected from the\nprogenitor system prior to the SN. The unknown distance between the CSM and SN\nexplosion site makes it impossible to predict when the interaction will start.\nIf the time between the SN and start of CSM interaction is of the order of\nmonths to years the SN has generally faded and is not actively followed up\nanymore, making it even more difficult to detect the interaction while it\nhappens. Here we report on a real-time monitoring program which ran between\n13-11-2023 and 09-07-2024, monitoring 6914 SNe Ia for signs of late-time\nrebrightening using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Flagged candidates\nwere rapidly followed up with photometry and spectroscopy to confirm the\nlate-time excess and its position. We report the discovery of a $\\sim50$ day\nrebrightening event in SN 2020qxz around 1200 days after the peak of its light\ncurve. SN 2020qxz had signs of early CSM interaction but faded from view over 2\nyears before its reappearance. Follow-up spectroscopy revealed 4 emission lines\nthat faded shortly after the end of the ZTF detected rebrightening.

This shows that catching and following up on\nlate-time interactions as they occur can give new clues about the nature of the\nprogenitor systems that produce these SNe by putting constraints on the\npossible type of donor star, and the only way to do this systematically is to\nuse large sky surveys such as ZTF to monitor a large sample of objects."}

The intracluster\nmedium (ICM) exhibits temperatures of approximately 8 keV across the core, with\na prominent cold front and a high-temperature region ($\\sim$11 keV) in the\nnorthwest. The average gas velocity in the 3 arcmin $\\times$ 4 arcmin region\naround the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) covered by two Resolve pointings is\nconsistent with that of the BCG to within 40 km s$^{-1}$ and we found modest\naverage velocity dispersion of 230-250 km s$^{-1}$. On the other hand,\nspatially-resolved spectroscopy reveals interesting variations. A blueshift of\nup to $\\sim$230 km s$^{-1}$ is observed around the east edge of the cold front,\nwhere the gas with the lowest specific entropy is found. The region further\nsouth inside the cold front shows only a small velocity difference from the\nBCG; however, its velocity dispersion is enhanced to 400 km s$^{-1}$, implying\nthe development of turbulence. These characteristics indicate that we are\nobserving sloshing motion with some inclination angle following BCG and that\ngas phases with different specific entropy participate in sloshing with their\nown velocities, as expected from simulations. No significant evidence for a\nhigh-redshift ICM component associated with the subcluster Abell 2319B was\nfound in the region covered by the current Resolve pointings. These results\nhighlight the importance of sloshing and turbulence in shaping the internal\nstructure of Abell 2319. Further deep observations are necessary to better\nunderstand the mixing and turbulent processes within the cluster."}

It has been reported that NGC 5813, the central\ndominant (cD) galaxy in the NGC 5846 group of galaxies, which shows signs of a\npossible recent merger event, has an unusually high number of ULXs. We have\nundertaken a multi-epoch spectral study of the persistent ULXs in the galaxy\nusing Chandra and XMM-Newton observations. Of the eight ULXs reported\nelsewhere, four have been re-identified, two are not consistently detected\nacross all nine Chandra observations, and two are found to be foreground\nsources. One new persistent ULX has been identified. We present a spectral\nanalysis of the five ULXs with luminosity consistently greater than $10^{39}$\nerg/s in nine Chandra-ACIS observations, and assess their variability, adding\ndata from XMM-Newton. The association of these ULXs with globular clusters was\nexamined: we find one ULX lying within the field of an HST observation within\n0.1$^\\prime$ of the centre of a globular cluster. Optical and UV counterparts\nare found for another ULX. One of the ULXs is found to be variable over the\ntime scale of days, but there is no unambiguous evidence of longer-term\nvariability for the remaining ULXs."}

The\nincreasing number of localized FRBs in recent years has provided more precise\nconstraints on these parameters.

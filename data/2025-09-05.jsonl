This \"ZTF SN Ia DR2\" sample\nis the largest SN Ia dataset to date.\n  Fully exploiting this dataset to improve understanding of the properties of\ndark energy requires a photometric accuracy of O(0.1%). This can be achieved\nusing Scene Modeling Photometry (SMP), which is optimal to extract a transient\nsignal (SN) from a complex background (its host), while ensuring a common flux\nestimator with nearby stars used as calibration reference. In this paper, we\npresent the status of the SMP development and use it to assess the precision\nand accuracy of the ZTF SN Ia DR2 force photometry light curves.\n  We reach a repeatability of the star observations better than 1%. However, we\nhave identified a new sensor effect, dubbed \"pocket-effect\", which distorts the\nPoint Spread Function (PSF) in a flux-dependent manner leading to\nnon-linearities in the photometry of a few percent. Correcting for this effect\nrequires time- and sensor-dependent corrections to be applied at the pixel\nlevel, which is currently under development. This effects affects all light\ncurve releases to date -- both from forced photometry and scene modelling\npreventing ZTF SN Ia DR2 to be used for accurate cosmological inference.\n  Comparing the SMP and forced photometry measurements, we find that stretch\nand color estimated from both processings are consistent, aside from a 10 mmag\nshift in color. This assess the robustness of results presented as part of the\nthe ZTF SN Ia DR2 release. The absolute calibration however shifts by 90 mmag.\nA reprocessing of the full ZTF SN Ia DR2 dataset using the SMP method is\ncurrently in progress."}

Contrary to recent related works that rely on finite\ndifferences to obtain a discrete measurement of the expansion of the Universe\nat an average redshift, our goal is to perform a cosmographic fit of $H(z)$ in\nterms of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the deceleration ($q_0$) and jerk\n($j_0$) parameters.

A cosmographic fit to the stellar ages is performed,\nwhich in turn enables the sampling of the Hubble parameter within the\nconsidered redshift range.

Despite ample evidence for the uniqueness of\nthis phenomenon, the periodic modulation in several pulsars are often confused\nwith subpulse drifting, primarily due to lack of clear characterisation of the\nemission features from a representative sample of pulsars. In this work we\npresent a detailed analysis of the single pulse behaviour from seventeen\npulsars exhibiting periodic amplitude modulation, six of them being new\ndetections. The pulsar switches between different intensity states as a result\nof periodic amplitude modulation and we propose a novel statistical scheme to\nidentify these emission states. The periodic modulation can be divided into\nthree broad categories, phase stationary modulation, modulations with phase\nshift and intermittent periodic modulations. The phase stationary behaviour is\nseen when the emission intensity across a major part of the pulse window\nchanges periodically. The phase shifts are associated with intensity changes at\nspecific locations within the emission window in a periodic manner; while in\nsome pulsars the periodic modulations become more prominent only at specific\nintervals resulting in intermittent behaviour."}

Their evolution is shaped by\nenergetic processes such as feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and\nmergers with other cosmic structures. The imprints of these processes on gas\nkinematic properties remain largely unknown, restricting our understanding of\ngas thermodynamics and energy conversion within clusters. High-resolution\nspectral mapping across a broad spatial-scale range provides a promising\nsolution to this challenge, enabled by the recent launch of the XRISM X-ray\nObservatory. Here, we present the kinematic measurements of the X-ray-brightest\nPerseus cluster with XRISM, radially covering the extent of its cool core. We\nfind direct evidence for the presence of at least two dominant drivers of gas\nmotions operating on distinct physical scales: a small-scale driver in the\ninner ~60 kpc, likely associated with the SMBH feedback; and a large-scale\ndriver in the outer core, powered by mergers. The inner driver sustains a\nheating rate at least an order of magnitude higher than the outer one. This\nfinding suggests that, during the active phase, the SMBH feedback generates\nturbulence, which, if fully dissipated into heat, could play a significant role\nin offsetting radiative cooling losses in the Perseus core. Our study\nunderscores the necessity of kinematic mapping observations of extended sources\nfor robust conclusions on the properties of the velocity field and their role\nin the assembly and evolution of massive halos. It further offers a kinematic\ndiagnostic for theoretical models of SMBH feedback."}

These\ninclude the amplitude and shape of the matter power spectrum, the thermal\nhistory of the IGM, the sum of neutrino masses, and potential small-scale\nfluctuations due to the nature of dark matter. However, P1D is also highly\nsensitive to observational and instrumental systematics, making accurate\nsynthetic spectra essential for validating analyses and quantifying these\neffects, especially in high-volume surveys like the Dark Energy Spectroscopic\nInstrument (DESI). We present an efficient lognormal mock framework for\ngenerating one-dimensional Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest spectra tailored for P1D\nanalysis. Our method captures the redshift evolution of the mean transmitted\nflux and the scale-dependent shape and amplitude of the one-dimensional flux\npower spectrum by tuning Gaussian field correlations and transformation\nparameters. Across the DESI Early Data Release (EDR) redshift range ($2.0 \\leq\nz \\leq 3.8$), and a wide range of scales ($10^{-4}$ s km$^{-1} \\leq k \\leq 1.0$\ns km$^{-1}$), our mocks recover the mean flux evolution with redshift to\nsub-percent accuracy, and the P1D at the percent level. Additionally, we\ndiscuss potential extensions of this framework, such as the incorporation of\nastrophysical contaminants, continuum uncertainties, and instrumental effects.\nSuch improvements would expand its utility in ongoing and upcoming surveys and\nenable a broader range of validation efforts and systematics studies for P1D\ninference and precision cosmology."}

Spectral sirens,\nusing GW data alone, can circumvent these limitations by leveraging features in\nthe mass distribution of compact binaries. With the recent release of the\nGravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 4 (GWTC-4.0), the number of significant\nbinary black hole (BBH) merger candidates has increased to 153, enabling more\nrobust population studies and cosmological constraints. This work builds upon\nprevious spectral siren analyses by analyzing the latest BBH observations with\nparametric and non-parametric models. In particular, we consider a parametric\napproach using the Powerlaw + Peak and Broken Powerlaw + 2 Peaks models as well\nas a more flexible non-parametric model based on Gaussian processes. We find\nbroad consistency in the inferred Hubble constant $H_0$ constraints across\nmodels. Our most constraining result is from the Gaussian Process model, which,\ncombined with the GW170817 bright siren measurement, results in $H_0 =\n69^{+7}_{-6} \\ \\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$, a 10% precision measurement. For\nthe Powerlaw + Peak and Broken Powerlaw + 2 Peaks we find fractional\nuncertainties of 17% and 13% respectively."}

Submitted to AAS journal", "summary": "Gravitational waves (GWs) with electromagnetic counterparts (EMc) offer a\nnovel approach to measure the Hubble constant ($H_0$), known as bright sirens,\nenabling $H_0$ measurements by combining GW-derived distances with EM-derived\nredshifts. Host galaxy identification is essential for redshift determination\nbut remains challenging due to poor GW sky localization and uncertainties in\nEMc models. To overcome these limitations, we exploit the ultra-high-precision\nlocalization ($\\Delta \\Omega_s \\sim 10^{-4} \\, \\text{deg}^2$) with a\nspace-based GW detector network (LISA-Taiji-TianQin), which permits unique host\nidentification solely from GW signals. We integrate five massive black hole\nbinary (MBHB) population models and two galaxy number density models to compute\nthe redshift horizon for host galaxy identification and evaluate $H_0$\nconstraints. We find that (1) The network enhances localization by several\norders of magnitude compared to single detectors; (2) The identification\nhorizon reaches $z\\sim 1.2$ for specific MBHBs in the most accurate\nlocalization case; (3) The population model choice critically impacts the\noutcomes: the most refined population models yield to independent EMc\nidentification rate of 0.6-1 $\\text{yr}^{-1}$ with $H_0$ constraints $< 1\\%$\nfractional uncertainty, the less refined models lead to the rate\n$<0.1\\text{yr}^{-1}$ and $1-2\\%$ uncertainty on $H_0$."}

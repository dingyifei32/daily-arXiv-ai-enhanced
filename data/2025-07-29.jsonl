These\nEoS are then implemented in a system of anisotropic structure equations based\non an axisymmetric metric, allowing for the analysis of how the magnetic field\nmodifies the structure of BEC stars, including their masses, radii,\ndeformations, gravitational redshifts, and mass quadrupole moments.

Over the 60-day duration reported here, the\nintegrated pulse profile remained consistently stable, exhibiting a single,\nnarrow peak with with a small precursor component and no evidence of a\npostcursor one. This pulse profile is in sharp contrast to the double-peaked\nmorphology observed during an observing campaign approximately 120 days\npreceding ours. Along with this change in the integrated pulse profile shape,\nwe also measure a slower spin-down rate compared to the end of that preceding\ncampaign. Together, these differences suggest that a mode-switching event\nlikely occurred between the end of that campaign and the start of ours.\nFinally, we derived a phase-connected timing solution from our data, from which\nwe inferred a characteristic age of approximately 2500 years, about 2.5 times\nolder than the most recent published estimate, and a surface dipole magnetic\nfield strength of roughly 1 x 10^14 G, nearly three times weaker.

With the weak prior,\nthe bispectrum significantly improves parameter constraints by breaking\ndegeneracies. For strong priors, improvements are more limited, especially for\nthe CMB bispectrum. On small scales, where non-linear effects dominate, the\nbispectrum's constraining power can rival that of the power spectrum.

Mounting evidence suggests an imminent outburst, offering a rare\nopportunity to observe a nearby nova in detail. We constrain the circumbinary\nmedium (CBM) by modeling inter-eruption radio observations and simulate the\nhydrodynamic evolution of the upcoming outburst to predict its X-ray\nsignatures, focusing on the roles of the red giant companion, accretion disk,\nand equatorial density enhancement (EDE). We model thermal radio emission from\na CBM composed of a spherical wind and a torus-like EDE to estimate its\ndensity. We then perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the nova outburst,\nvarying explosion energy, ejecta mass, and CBM configuration. From these, we\nsynthesize X-ray light curves and spectra as they would appear to XMM-Newton\nand XRISM. The CBM in T CrB is significantly less dense than in other symbiotic\nnovae, with a mass-loss rate of $\\dot{M} \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-9}$ M$_{\\odot}$\nyr$^{-1}$ for a 10 km s$^{-1}$ wind. Despite the low-density EDE, the blast is\ncollimated along the poles by the accretion disk and EDE, producing a bipolar\nshock. The red giant partially shields the ejecta, forming a bow shock and hot\nwake. X-ray evolution proceeds through three phases: an early phase (first few\nhours) dominated by shocked disk material; an intermediate phase ($\\sim 1$\nweek-1 month) driven by reverse-shocked ejecta; and a late phase dominated by\nshocked EDE. Soft X-rays trace shocked ejecta, hard X-rays arise from shocked\nambient gas, and synthetic spectra show asymmetric, blueshifted lines due to\nabsorption by expanding ejecta. The X-ray evolution resembles that of RS Oph\nand V745 Sco, with a peak luminosity of $L_\\mathrm{X} \\approx 10^{36}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$, but features a more prolonged soft X-ray phase, reflecting the lower\nCBM density and distinct ejecta-environment interaction."}

We find that the model sequence predicts the light curves\nwhich align with the Phillip's relation ($B_{\\max}$ vs. $\\Delta M_{15}$). Our\nmodels hint at a unifying approach in triggering Type Ia supernovae without\ninvolving two distinctive evolutionary tracks."}

Accepted to ApJL on July\n  23, 2025, submitted on December 21, 2024", "summary": "The extension of the cosmic-ray (CR) spectrum well beyond 1~PeV necessitates\nthe existence of a population of accelerators in the Milky Way, which we refer\nto as Super PeVatrons. Identifying the nature of these sources remains a\nchallenge to the paradigm of galactic CRs. Galactic super-accreting X-ray\nbinaries, where the compact object accretes at a rate near or above the\nEddington limit, can meet the energy requirement to supply the high-energy\npopulation of galactic CRs. We demonstrate that the trans-relativistic jets\nand/or winds of these powerful objects with kinetic energy luminosity exceeding\n$10^{39} \\, \\rm erg/s$, can accelerate protons to energies above several PeV.\nDetection of such super-accreting X-ray binaries through their\nultra-high-energy $\\gamma$-ray ``halos\" and large-scale nebulae is also\ndiscussed."}

Supplemental Material (4 pages, 1 figure)\n  included", "summary": "We show that primordial black holes (PBHs) with significant spin and bulk\nmotion produce sharply collimated neutrino bursts from Hawking evaporation,\narising from the interplay of spin-induced angular anisotropy and relativistic\nDoppler boosting. This effect shifts the neutrino spectrum into the multi-GeV\nto hundreds of GeV range, where atmospheric backgrounds drop steeply, and\nenhances the flux by orders of magnitude within a narrow forward cone. We\ncompute the full lab-frame neutrino distribution and derive updated constraints\non PBH number density from non-observation of such bursts in IceCube and\nKM3NeT. Our results identify directional high-energy neutrino bursts as a\ndistinctive, testable signature of spinning PBHs, providing a complementary\nprobe of the PBH dark matter hypothesis and Hawking radiation."}

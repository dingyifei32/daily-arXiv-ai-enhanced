The identification of the\nelectromagnetic counterparts of GW sources is crucial for multi-messenger\nastronomy, one way of which is to use galaxy catalogues to guide optical\nfollow-up observations. In this paper, we test the utility of galaxy-targeted\napproach with mass prioritised galaxy ranking for the ongoing LIGO O4 run. We\nhave used the simulated results for the expected LIGO O4 events and the NED-LVS\ngalaxy catalogue and based our study for small field of view telescopes,\nspecifically the GROWTH-India Telescope (GIT). With the increase in sensitivity\nof LIGO/Virgo in the ongoing observing run O4, the expected number of total\ndetections have gone up but most of these are also now poorly localised. We\nshow that a larger volume covered in the same field-of-view (FoV) on the sky\nresults in a large increase in the total number of galaxies in each FoV. A\nsignificant top-heaviness is observed in the mass-ranked list of galaxies,\nwhich still number to a few thousand in most cases. At larger distances, such\nhigh numbers of deep follow-up observations are infeasible in most cases\nrendering galaxy catalogues useful in limited cases, but these are still useful\nat lower distances where LVK detectors are currently sensitive and where galaxy\ncompleteness is higher. We also explore the effect of mass-filling to account\nfor galaxy catalogue incompleteness at large distances. If mass-filled\nprobabilities are considered as the metric for ranking and coverage, we find\nthat the conventional 2D probability search performs better than a 3D galaxy\ncatalogue (without mass-filling) based search at distances larger than 300 Mpc\n(upto which NED-LVS is ~70% complete), and using 3D mass times probability in\neach tile performs better for nearby events."}

Although over 30\nsuch quasars are now known at $z > 5.5$, the signal remains elusive in\npractice, owing to instrumental noise, the intrinsic weakness of the absorption\nfeatures, and the limited brightness of available background sources. Recent\nstudies have focused on the one-dimensional transmission power spectrum as a\nstatistical observable, but this approach also demands high signal-to-noise\nratios. Here, we present a systematic comparison of five inference pipelines\nfor recovering IGM parameters from mock 21-cm forest spectra at $z = 6$,\nincorporating realistic instrumental noise and telescope characteristics. We\nshow that likelihood-free inference based on machine learning substantially\noutperforms traditional Bayesian methods. In particular, our most effective\nmethod dispenses with the power spectrum entirely: we use a convolutional U-Net\nto extract a latent-space encoding of the input spectrum and perform parameter\nregression using XGBoost. This approach yields accurate constraints on the IGM\nneutral fraction and X-ray heating efficiency even with a single 50-hour uGMRT\nsightline, which is an orders-of-magnitude improvement in integration time\nrelative to existing techniques.

The simulations were\nproduced with the latest version of the PINOCCHIO code, and provide the\nlargest, public set of simulated skies. Mock galaxy catalogues were obtained by\npopulating haloes with galaxies using an halo occupation distribution (HOD)\nmodel extracted from the Flagship galaxy catalogue provided by Euclid\nCollaboration. The Geppetto set of 3500 simulated skies was obtained by tiling\na 1.2 Gpc/h box to cover a light-cone whose sky footprint is a circle of 30 deg\nradius, for an area of 2763 deg$^2$ and a minimum halo mass of\n$1.5\\times10^{11}$ Msun/h. The relatively small box size makes this set unfit\nfor measuring very large scales. The EuclidLargeBox set consists of 1000\nsimulations of 3.38 Gpc/h, with the same mass resolution and a footprint that\ncovers half of the sky, excluding the Milky Way zone of avoidance. From this we\nproduced a set of 1000 EuclidLargeMocks on the 30 deg radius footprint, whose\ncomoving volume is fully contained in the simulation box. We validated the two\nsets of catalogues by analysing number densities, power spectra, and 2-point\ncorrelation functions, showing that the Flagship spectroscopic catalogue is\nconsistent with being one of the realisations of the simulated sets, although\nwe noticed small deviations limited to the quadrupole at k>0.2 h/Mpc. We show\ncosmological parameter inference from these catalogues and demonstrate that\nusing one realisation of EuclidLargeMocks in place of the Flagship mock\nproduces the same posteriors, to within the expected shift given by sample\nvariance. These simulated skies will be used for the galaxy clustering analysis\nof Euclid's Data Release 1 (DR1)."}

The fundamental problem of this description is associated with\nthe polycrystalline nature of the crust: similar to terrestrial materials, the\nelastic moduli, strictly speaking, depend on the shape and orientation of\ncrystallites, but for the crust, they are unknown. As a result, some\nassumptions are generally required to predict the elastic properties or\nconstrain their possible range. In this paper, we follow the commonly believed\nassumption that the crust is (locally) isotropic, which allows us to describe\nelastic properties by two (effective) parameters: bulk and shear moduli. The\nbulk modulus is well determined by the Voigt-Reuss bounds, and we constrain the\nshear modulus by applying, for the first time in astrophysics of compact stars,\nthe variational Hashin-Shtrikman approach, based on the additional assumption\nthat there are no correlations in the orientation of crystallites. We analyse\nthe Hashin-Shtrikman bounds for the one-component crust taking into account the\nelectron screening and the motion of the nuclei, and for two-component static\ncrystals. In particular, we demonstrate that within applied assumptions the\neffective shear modulus should be lower than the Voigt estimate, typically\napplied in the astrophysical literature."}

Previous works studying the threshold mass for prompt collapse to a\nblack hole have primarily focused on the uncertainties in the zero-temperature\nEoS, which are parametrized by a macroscopic quantity such as the\ncharacteristic neutron star radius. However, prompt collapse can take place\neither with or without a core bounce during the merger. In the bounce-collapse\nscenario, shocks can produce additional thermal support, potentially altering\nthe threshold for collapse. In this work, we investigate the impact of the\nuncertainties in the finite-temperature part of the nuclear EoS on the\nthreshold mass for prompt collapse in equal mass mergers. Using two cold EoSs,\ncombined with four parametrizations of the finite-temperature part of the EoS,\nwe find that the threshold mass is insensitive to realistic variations of the\nthermal prescription, at sub-percent accuracy. We report on the thermal\nproperties and ejecta of mergers with masses just above the threshold mass,\ni.e., which experience a single core-bounce before collapsing. During the\nbounce, the thermal pressure can reach )(1-10)% of the cold pressure at\nsupranuclear densities, depending on the thermal treatment, leading to modest\ndifferences in the dynamical ejecta that are launched and in the remnant disk\nmass as a result."}

The X-ray LP arises from multiple scattering of initially soft photons\nin a hot, optically thick Compton cloud (CC) using a flat geometry. ST85 showed\nthat the LP degree $P$ depends on the binary inclination $i$ and remains\nindependent of the photon energy.

Within this framework, we derive the modified field equations with\nstatic spherical symmetry, and numerically integrate the corresponding\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations with the chosen hybrid equations of\nstate. Our analyses show that, unlike in general relativity, the Ricci scalar\nremains nonzero outside the stellar surface, and gradually falls to zero beyond\n50 km, while the stellar surface remains within 10--12 km for the hybrid\nequations of state considered. This extended Ricci scalar profile arises from\nthe extra degree of freedom (scalaron) inherent in Starobinsky gravity, which\nalso contributes to the gravitational mass outside the star, causing the ADM\nmass measured at infinity to exceed the stellar mass at the surface.\nNevertheless, the key physical relationships, such as the mass-central density\nand mass-radius curves, remain consistent with what is expected physically.\nNotably, we find that the maximum stable mass of neutron stars increases with\nthe Starobinsky parameter $\\alpha$, with the combined MIT-BSk21 model\nsupporting an ADM mass of up to $2.07 \\, M_\\odot$ for $\\alpha = 10\\,r_g^2$.\nThis theoreical limit for a nonrotating neutron star suggests that a rotating\nconfiguration could reach mass thresholds in the range of $2.48$ to $2.59 \\,\nM_\\odot$, considering that rapid rotation can enhance the maximum mass by\napproximately 20--25\\%."}

Located at redshift $z=0.151$, this event\nis relatively nearby by GRB standards yet remains cosmologically distant,\nmaking the survival of multi-TeV photons surprising. The Large High Altitude\nAir Shower Observatory detected photons with energies up to $\\sim 13$~TeV\nduring the early afterglow phase, challenging standard EBL models. We\ninvestigate whether several theoretical frameworks can explain this anomalous\nemission: reduced EBL opacity due to cosmic voids along the line of sight,\nnovel emission mechanisms within the GRB environment, secondary $\\gamma$-ray\nproduction through cosmic-ray cascades, and new-physics scenarios involving\nLorentz-invariance violation or axion-like particles. Our analysis highlights\nthe exceptional nature of this event and ongoing theoretical tensions about the\ndominant physical processes. We discuss the limitations of current models and\nidentify specific observational signatures that future multiwavelength and\nmulti-messenger observations could provide to discriminate between competing\nexplanations. Continued study of similar events with next-generation facilities\nwill be crucial for resolving these challenges and advancing our understanding\nof extreme particle acceleration in astrophysical environments."}

Interestingly, the parameter\nspace needed to explain the inferred GW231123 rate is at the edge of the\nexclusion region from Xray and CMB observations, suggesting that this\ninterpretation can be either confirmed or ruled out.

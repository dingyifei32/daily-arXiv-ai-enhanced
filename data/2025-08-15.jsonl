The full FDM dynamics are\nimplemented in reionization simulations, along with a new ansatz on modulation\nof the FDM HMF by the linear overdensity. Not only does the suppression of FDM\nhalos on small scales give rise to delay of the signature epochs during cosmic\nreionization, but these epochs are also shortened relative to the cold dark\nmatter cosmology. In addition, we find that while the FDM effects on the 21-cm\npower spectrum are dominated by its linear dynamics early in Cosmic Dawn, a\ncorrect FDM HMF resulting from nonlinear wave dynamics must be considered when\nX-ray heating begins. We forecast the constraints on the FDM model parameters\nfrom upcoming 21-cm power spectrum measurements by SKA1-Low (central area).

Unlike HMcode-2020, which relies on 12 phenomenological parameters,\nour approach achieves comparable or superior accuracy without any free fitting\nparameters. This new web-halo model (WHM) extends the traditional halo model by\nincorporating structures that have collapsed along two dimensions (filaments)\nand one dimension (sheets), in addition to haloes, and combines these with\n1-loop Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (1$\\ell$-LPT) in a consistent framework.\nWe show that WHM matches N-body simulation power spectra within the precision\nof state-of-the-art emulators at the 2-halo to 1-halo transition regime at all\nredshifts. Specifically, the WHM achieves better than 2\\% accuracy up to scales\nof $k = 0.4\\, h\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, $0.7\\, h\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and $1.3\\,\nh\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at redshifts $z = 0.0$, $0.8$, and $1.5$, respectively,\nfor both the baccoemu and EuclidEmu2 emulators, across their full\n$w_0w_a\\mathrm{CDM} + \\sum m_\\nu$ cosmological parameter space. This marks a\nsubstantial improvement over 1$\\ell$-LPT and HMcode-2020, the latter of which\nperforms similarly at low redshift but deteriorates at higher redshifts despite\nits 12 tuned parameters. We publicly release WHM as WHMcode, integrated into\nexisting HMcode implementations for CAMB and CLASS."}

The gradient surface terms of the\nNS energy density $\\cal{E}(\\rho)$ [Equation of State] are taken into account\nalong with the volume ones at the leading order of the leptodermic parameter\n$a/R << 1$, where $a$ is the ES crust thickness and $R$ is the mean NS radius.\nThe macroscopic NS angular momentum at small frequencies $\\omega$ is specified\nfor calculations of the adiabatic moment of inertia (MI) within the Kerr metric\ncoordinate approach in the outer Boyer-Lindquist and inner Hogan forms. The NS\nMI, $\\Theta=\\tilde{\\Theta}/(1-\\cal{G}_{t\\varphi})$, was obtained in terms of\nthe statistically averaged MI, $\\tilde{\\Theta}$, and its time and\nazimuthal-angle correlation, $\\cal{G}_{t\\varphi}$, as sums of the volume and\nsurface components. The MI $\\Theta$ depends dramatically on its effective\nradius $R$ because of strong gravitation and surface effects.

We point out the similarity of the rings in the Cir X-1 CCSN\nremnant to a ring in the Cygnus Loop CCSN remnant. While the X-ray binary\nsystem Cir X-1 actively launches jets, no such activity exists in the Cygnus\nLoop. In both CCSN remnants, we attribute the rings to jets that are part of\nthe explosion process in the framework of the jittering jets explosion\nmechanism (JJEM). We also identify such a ring in the CCSN remnant 107.7-5.1,\nwhich we also attribute to exploding jets. We conduct three-dimensional\nhydrodynamical simulations of late jets inside an exploding massive stellar\ncore, and demonstrate the feasibility of this scenario for ring formation. The\nCir X-1 CCSN remnant has a large blowout, similar to that of the Cygnus Loop\nand to a large protrusion in the CCSN remnant G0.9+0.1 . Based on these\nsimilarities, we suggest that other exploding jets inflated the blowout of the\nCir X-1 nebula, identical to an earlier claim on the formation of the blowout\nof the Cygnus Loop. We identify a point-symmetric structure in the Cir X-1 CCSN\nremnant, strengthening the JJEM. This study further demonstrates that the JJEM\nis a successful explosion mechanism to analyze CCSNe and CCSN remnants."}

Cas A has a\nline-rich spectrum dominated by thermal emission and given its high flux, it is\nan appealing target for high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy. Cas A was observed\nat two different locations during the Performance Verification phase of the\nXRISM mission, one location in the southeastern part (SE) of the remnant and\none in the northwestern part (NW). This paper serves as an overview of these\nobservations and discusses some of the issues relevant for the analysis of the\ndata. We present maps of the so-called ``spatial-spectral mixing'' effect due\nto the fact that the XRISM point-spread function is larger than a pixel in the\nResolve calorimeter array. We analyze spectra from two bright, on-axis regions\nsuch that the effects of spatial-spectral mixing are minimized. We find that it\nis critical to include redshifts/blueshifts and broadening of the emission\nlines in the two thermal components to achieve a reasonable fit given the high\nspectral resolution of the Resolve calorimeter. We fit the spectra with two\nversions of the AtomDB atomic database (3.0.9 and 3.1.0) and two versions of\nthe SPEX (3.08.00 and 3.08.01*) spectral fitting software. Overall we find good\nagreement between AtomDB 3.1.0 and SPEX 3.08.01* for the spectral models\nconsidered in this paper. The most significant difference we found between\nAtomDB 3.0.9 and 3.1.0 and between AtomDB 3.1.0 and SPEX 3.08.01* is the Ni\nabundance, with the new atomic data favoring a considerably lower (up to a\nfactor of 3) Ni abundance. Both regions exhibit significantly enhanced\nabundances compared to Solar values indicating that supernova ejecta dominate\nthe emission in these regions. We find that the abundance ratios of Ti/Fe,\nMn/Fe, \\& Ni/Fe are significantly lower in the NW than the SE."}

The average H2 ionisation rate in\nthe CMZ is estimated to be 2e-14 s-1, which is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher\nthan anywhere else in the Galaxy. Due to the high gas density in this region,\nelectromagnetic radiation is rapidly absorbed, leaving low-energy cosmic rays\n(CRs) as the only effective ionising agents. Hence, a high CR density has been\ninvoked to explain such high ionisation rates. However, a corresponding excess\nin gamma rays, which would result from interactions of high-energy CRs, has not\nbeen observed. This suggests that the supposed excess exists only in the\nlow-energy CR spectrum. To constrain this unknown low-energy component, we\nfirst derive the high-energy CR injection spectra using gamma-ray and radio\ndata, to which we add various low-energy components. We then propagate these\ninjection spectra by numerically solving the CR transport equation using a\nCrank-Nicolson scheme. Testing multiple CR injection scenarios, we find that\nthe energy required to sustain the observed ionisation rates is excessively\nhigh in every case.

In\naddition to the torques, even the tiniest deformations of the NS crust can\naffect its rotation through asymmetries in its inertia tensor. Several factors\nmay be responsible for the deformations, including strong magnetic fields,\ninternal stresses, or local heating. The main effect produced by the\ndeformations is the so-called free precession: the motion of the rotational\naxis with respect to the crust. We consider the evolution of a triaxially\ndeformed isolated NS with a strong dipolar magnetic field for a broad range of\nparameters, taking into account the magnetic field decay. We show that the\ncombination of pulsar torques and free precession results in a considerable\nbroadening of the distribution of magnetic obliquity angles (the angle between\nthe magnetic and rotational axes) and creates a population of objects where the\nrotational axis does not align with the magnetic axis at all but enters a\nlimit-cycle regime. The combination of free precession and magnetic torques can\nalso explain the observed distribution in pulsar braking indices by creating a\nperiodic oscillation in the magnetic obliquity."}

We detect\nground-space fringes at projected baselines extending up to 4.6 Earth\ndiameters, which allowed us to image the jet in OJ 287 with an angular\nresolution of ~47 {\\mu}as. Applying an advanced regularized maximum likelihood\nimaging method, we resolved the innermost jet structure with a complex\nmorphology at a resolution of ~15 {\\mu}as (~0.1 pc projected distance). For the\nfirst time, due to a favorable geometrical position of the jet in tandem with\nhigh data quality, we detect multiple sharp bends that form a \"ribbon-like\" jet\nstructure that extends down to 1 mas. Two-dimensional Gaussian model-fitting\nreveals regions of the jet with brightness temperatures of more than 10^13 K,\nindicative of strong Doppler boosting. Polarimetric imaging reveals that the\nelectric vector position angles are predominantly perpendicular to the\ninnermost jet direction, implying a dominant poloidal magnetic field component\nnear the central engine. Complementary multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array\nobservations at 43 GHz provide a multifrequency view of the jet evolution.\nRidgeline analysis of the 43 GHz data shows significant variations in the jet\nposition angle from 2014 to 2017, behavior consistent with a rotating helical\njet structure. Finally, we confirm the emergence of a new jet component (B15 or\nK), which may be associated with the source's first TeV flare, and offer new\nobservational constraints relevant to models involving a supermassive black\nhole binary."}

Previous results using single-epoch X-ray and rest-frame UV\nobservations of samples of faded CL quasars suggest that their SED properties\nat low Eddington ratios display similarities to X-ray binaries fading from\noutburst. However, more robust tests demand multi-epoch observations that can\ntrace the temporal behavior of the SEDs of individual AGN at low Eddington\nratios. Here, we perform this test, by obtaining a second epoch of UV and X-ray\nobservations of a sample of three faded CL quasars with bolometric Eddington\nratios of <10^-3, using a combination of contemporaneous HST UV imaging,\nChandra X-ray observations, and optical spectroscopy. We find that all three CL\nquasars varied in luminosity, and their optical-to-X-ray spectral indices\nalpha_OX all individually display a negative (harder-when-brighter) correlation\nwith Eddington ratio. This SED evolution is also often observed in X-ray\nbinaries at low Eddington ratios, and adds to the growing evidence that AGN\naccretion flows behave analogously to X-ray binaries across all accretion\nstates."}

A\npromising explanation is the $\\nu p$-process, which is posited to operate in\nthe neutrino-driven outflows that form inside core-collapse supernovae after\nshock revival. Recent studies have identified several relevant physical effects\nthat influence the yields of this process. The impact of General Relativity\n(GR) on the $\\nu p$-process yields, however, remains unexplored. In this work,\nwe perform a comparative analysis of the time-integrated yields of the $p$\nnuclei up to $A \\lesssim 105$ in Newtonian and fully GR neutrino-driven\noutflows, using a detailed model of a time-evolving outflow profile. The two\nmain GR effects are the gravitational shift of neutrino energies and\npost-Newtonian corrections to the gravitational potential. These effects\ntogether suppress the production of seed nuclei, significantly boosting the\n$\\nu p$-process yields in our 18 $M_\\odot$ progenitor model. Most of the\nproduction of the crucial $^{92,94}{\\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\\rm Ru}$ $p$\nisotopes in this model occurs in an optimal time window, 1-3 seconds after\nshock revival. Interestingly, the same does not apply to the shielded isotope\n$^{92}{\\rm Nb}$, a large fraction of which is produced in the subsequent\nejecta. The impact of GR on this isotope is especially large, with its final\nabundance boosted by a factor of 25 compared to a Newtonian calculation. In our\n12.75 $M_\\odot$ model, an additional GR effect is observed: the outflow\ntransitions to the supersonic regime several seconds into the explosion,\ncausing the yields to drop. This study quantifies the important role GR effects\nplay in the $\\nu p$-process and provides guidance for identifying optimal\nconditions in future self-consistent supernova simulations."}

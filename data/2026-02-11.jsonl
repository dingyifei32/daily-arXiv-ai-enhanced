Their uniformity is credited to their single origin as thermonuclear explosions of White dwarf (WD) stars. Nevertheless, some SNe Ia break this regularity. Prominently, the Iax subclass are less energetic and remarkably diverse, raising questions about their progenitor systems. While no progenitor system of a normal SN Ia has ever been detected, a luminous blue star was identified in pre-explosion images of the site of the bright SN Iax SN 2012Z, suggested to be a helium giant companion star acting as a mass donor to a WD SN progenitor. This is in line with models of weak mass accretion of a WD from a binary companion, producing an explosion that does not fully disrupt the star. However, these models fail to explain the properties of the faintest Type Iax explosions, suggesting either they originate from other WD binary systems, or even from massive progenitor stars. Here, we present the faint SN Iax SN 2024vjm - possibly the faintest supernova observed to date. Using a deep pre-explosion image taken by the recently launched Euclid space mission, we show that its progenitor system must be fainter than the helium giant SN Iax progenitor candidate of SN 2012Z, as well as that of the luminous red companion or remnant of the faint SN 2008ha, and may require a subdwarf helium star as a mass donor. The deep image also provides strong arguments against a massive star origin for this faint supernova. Our observations argue that SN 2024vjm is a WD explosion, but we find that remarkably faint SNe Iax fade more slowly than bright ones, i.e., they evolve in an opposite manner from the famous Phillips relation that makes regular SNe Ia cosmological candles."}

Current models aimed at explaining the observed multiwavelength flares in Sgr A* often assume hotspots moving on geodesic, Keplerian orbits. In many scenarios, though, a hotspot may instead follow an inspiraling trajectory, potentially transitioning into a plunge toward the black hole. In this work, we present a general framework to simulate the polarized emission from generic equatorial inspiraling hotspots in Kerr spacetime using a parametric four-velocity profile. This parametrization defines a continuous family of flows, ranging from Cunningham's disk model (fixed radius orbits outside the innermost stable circular orbit and plunging motion within the innermost stable circular orbit) to purely radial motion, thereby extending the standard assumptions. Within this framework, we show that inspiral motion produces a distinctive observational signature: a precessing, unwinding evolution of the polarimetric Stokes Q-U looping pattern, in sharp contrast with the closed Q-U loops associated with stable orbits at a fixed radius. We then explore how the morphology of these signatures depends on black hole spin, observer inclination, and magnetic-field configuration. The presented model can be applied to current and near-future interferometric observations of linear polarization, offering a new avenue to probe the physics of matter spiraling inward and the relativistic velocities of plunging plasma."}

Angular-momentum transfer from the accretion disk naturally spins up the WD, while the amplified internal magnetic field induces a non-axisymmetric deformation in presence of a misaligned rotation. Such WDs emits continuous gravitational waves (CGWs). We model the coupled evolutions of stellar mass, spin, and magnetic structure in accreting WDs in SSSs with \\texttt{MESA}, and compute the resulting quadrupolar deformation with the Einstein-Maxwell solver \\texttt{XNS}. We show that WDs in SSSs, particularly near the end ofthermal timescale mass transfer and close to the Chandrasekhar mass limit, produce CGWs predominantly in the deci-Hz band accessible to planned detectors such as DECIGO, BBO, Deci-Hz, ALIA, and LGWA, and are distinguishable from other Galactic CGW sources such as AM\\,CVn systems, detached double WDs, and isolated WDs. Well-studied SSSs such as CAL~83 and RX~J0019+2156 can be detectable, enabling targeted CGW measurements that directly probe WD's internal magnetic fields and rotation, while blind searches can reveal hundreds of obscured SSSs otherwise missed in soft X-rays and map the hidden population of accreting, rapidly rotating, magnetized WDs in nearby galaxies. A CGW detection from WDs in SSSs could also identify potential pre-explosion Type~Ia progenitors."}

The identical setup and observing procedure allow for direct, accurate measurements of morphological and kinematic changes over a seven-year baseline. We identified 263 compact knots in the 2020 image and, through comparison with the 2013 catalog of Koo et al. 2018 (arXiv:1809.07935), classified them into quasi-stationary circumstellar knots and fast-moving knots (FMKs) of supernova ejecta. The FMKs show significant flux fluctuations, and many of those detected in 2013 are absent in the 2020 image. Proper-motion measurements derived from cross-correlation analysis indicate that most FMKs follow nearly ballistic expansion, whereas some, particularly those just beyond the eastern Fe-rich, X-ray emitting ejecta region, exhibit noticeable deceleration. The proper motions of the main ejecta shell were also measured and modeled as a uniformly expanding shell with a systemic motion, which reproduces the observed geometric and kinematic asymmetries of the remnant."}

In this work, we use an optimized version of the principal component analysis (PCA) to model uncertainties in the full shape of the redshift distributions, a method proposed by \\cite{pca_method} and recently used in the Dark Energy Survey Y6 analysis. Here, we implement this new approach within the Roman High Latitude Imaging Survey (HLIS) Cosmology Project Infrastructure Team (PIT) pipeline, namely Cobaya-Cosmolike Joint Architecture (\\texttt{CoCoA}). To validate the PCA in mitigating biases on cosmological parameters, $S_8$ and $Ω_m$, we use a set of redshift distributions from \\texttt{Cardinal} generated for a variety of Roman configurations. Overall, when the simulated cosmic shear data vector is not strongly miscalibrated relative to the fiducial one, both the mean-shift and the PCA-based approaches produce consistent cosmological constraints when marginalizing over nuisance parameters. For mild to strong miscalibration, including additional PCs progressively mitigates biases in $S_8$ and $Ω_m$, and can achieve comparable performance with fewer parameters than the nine tomographic-bin mean-shift model."}

The line was detected 21.5 days (rest-frame) after an X-ray coronal flare observed in 2008 and it exhibits significant broadening consistent with relativistic reflection from the accretion disk in the vicinity of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). The line has a width of ~300 eV, corresponding to a Keplerian velocity of 14,000 km s-1, at a distance of 5-41 light-days from the SMBH, strongly implying that the observed coronal flare triggered the emergence of the line. This event provides rare direct evidence of the response of the accretion disk to impulsive coronal illumination and offers a new method to probe the SMBH and disk physics. The relativistic modeling favors a broadened line produced by distant reflection from an accretion disk around a rapidly spinning black hole viewed at an intermediate inclination, consistent with other observations. Systematic monitoring of type 1 AGN following strong X-ray flares may open a new observational window into the innermost regions of AGN, enabling constraints on the physics of SMBH and its accretion disk at different radii that are otherwise challenging to access."}

While many viable constructions rely on non-canonical kinetic terms, non-minimal couplings, or modifications of gravity, it remains an open question whether comparably small tensor amplitudes can emerge within a minimal, single-field framework driven solely by potential dynamics. In this work we propose a novel inflationary scenario based on a modified Lennard-Jones potential. Inspired by a well-known interaction potential in molecular physics, the proposed form naturally combines a smooth minimum with an extended flat plateau at large field values. This intrinsic structure supports slow-roll inflation and ensures a graceful exit without introducing additional degrees of freedom. We perform a detailed analysis of the inflationary dynamics and confront the model with current observational constraints. We find that the scalar spectral index is fully consistent with CMB data, while the tensor-to-scalar ratio is predicted to be extremely small, reaching values as low as $r\\sim10^{-7}$. Finally, the running of the scalar spectral index is also found to be small, well withing the 1$σ$ recent observational bounds from Atacama Cosmology Telescope."}

In this work, we implemented, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of the STE detected by GECAM, including their morphology, energy deposition, and the dependence on the geomagnetic coordinates.

This finding challenges the standard $Λ$CDM model and minimally coupled scalar field scenarios, including the original Running Curvaton model, which is typically constrained to the quintessence regime. In this work, we propose a unified cosmological framework by extending the Running Curvaton model via a non-minimal gravitational coupling of the form $ξχ^2 R$. We demonstrate that this geometric modification allows the effective equation of state to naturally evolve from a quintessence-like to a phantom-like regime in the Jordan frame, thereby providing a superior fit to the DESI observational contours ($w_0 > -1, w_a < 0$). Crucially, we show that the introduction of non-minimal coupling does not compromise the model's success in describing the early universe. Through a parameter re-tuning mechanism involving the coupling constant ($g_0^{obs} = g_0 + 2ξ$), the predictions for the primordial power spectrum (spectral index $n_s$) and local-type non-Gaussianity ($f_{NL}$) remain strictly preserved and consistent with Planck data. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive stability analysis within the Horndeski framework, verifying that the model remains free from ghost and gradient instabilities ($c_s^2 = 1$). Our results suggest that the non-minimally coupled Running Curvaton offers a robust, stable, and unified description of inflation and late-time accelerated expansion compatible with the latest precision cosmology data."}

A frequency-dependent lag analysis in the 7-9 $\\times 10^{-5}$ Hz range reveals a soft X-ray lag of 889-3000s in the combined 2019 data, detected with a significance of 80%. The cross-correlation function analysis, supported by simulations, also detects lags of similar nature. Spectral modeling performed by adopting both proposed black hole masses in the literature for Mrk 110 confirms the presence of a warm corona in all observations, along with a weak relativistic reflection component and the reflection fraction remains low (Rf < 1). Interpreting the measured soft lag in terms of light travel time implies an emission radius 4.5 Rg for a supermassive black hole mass of $M = 1.4 \\times 10^8$ solar mass , favoring a reflection scenario. However, if a lower mass of $M = 2 \\times 10^7$ solar mass is adopted, the inferred radius increases, and both relativistic reflection and warm Comptonization can plausibly contribute to the observed soft lag. The warm corona radius appears larger in the high accretion state and smaller in a lower accretion state, although no trend can be established. The persistently low reflection fraction suggests an outflowing inner corona in Mrk 110, consistent with the recent detection of jet activity in this source."}

From these data, we study ~140 million galaxies (8.29 galaxies/arcmin$^2$) that are 50% complete at i=24.0 and extend beyond z=1.2. We divide the galaxies into four redshift bins, and obtain cosmic shear measurement with a signal-to-noise of 83, a factor of 2 higher than the Year 3 analysis. We model the uncertainties due to shear and redshift calibrations, and discard measurements on small angular scales to mitigate baryon feedback and other small-scale uncertainties. We consider two fiducial models to account for the intrinsic alignment (IA) of the galaxies. We conduct a blind analysis in the context of the $Λ$CDM model and find $S_8 \\equiv σ_8(Ω_m/0.3)^{0.5}=0.798^{+0.014}_{-0.015}$ (marginalized mean with 68% CL) when using the non-linear alignment model (NLA) and $S_{8} = 0.783^{+0.019}_{-0.015}$ with the tidal alignment and tidal torque model (TATT), providing 1.8% and 2.5% uncertainty on $S_8$. Compared to constraints from the cosmic microwave background from Planck 2018, ACT DR6 and SPT-3G DR1, we find consistency in the full parameter space at 1.1$σ$ (1.7$σ$) and in $S_8$ at 2.0$σ$ (2.3$σ$) for NLA (TATT). The result using the NLA model is preferred according to the Bayesian evidence. We find that the model choice for IA and baryon feedback can impact the value of our $S_8$ constraint up to $1σ$. For our fiducial model choices, the resultant uncertainties in $S_8$ are primarily degraded by the removal of scales, as well as the marginalization over the IA parameters. We demonstrate that our result is internally consistent and robust to different choices in calibrating the data, owing to methodological improvements in shear and redshift measurement, laying the foundation for next-generation cosmic shear programs."}

We operate the IBIS telescope as a Coded mask Compton telescope, using the Crab Nebula to refine the calibration, as is usually done for high-energy instruments. We have determined the spectroscopic and polarimetric properties of the IBIS Compton mode and their evolution along the entire duration of the mission. In addition, the long-term evolution of the Crab Nebula's polarization has been successfully measured and compared with other high-energy experiments. We could estimate the energy dependence of the Crab Nebula polarization in four bands between 200 keV and 1 MeV. In particular, the detection of polarized emissions strictly above 400 keV makes it the highest energy measurement ever performed for the Crab Nebula. A Python library was also made publicly available to analyze processed data."}

Such DS decays into Standard Model (SM) states can modify the late-time thermal history of the IGM, making Lyman-$α$ data a sensitive probe of hidden sectors with cosmologically long lifetimes. Our analysis demonstrates that constraints from late-time IGM heating offer a complementary window to those from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), in constraining dark sector parameter space. We further revisit limits on such decaying DS models from Planck's measurements of the optical depth to reionization and provide updates relevant for DS lifetimes longer than $10^{14}$ s. The model-independent constraints on the DS parameter space we derive in this work can be reinterpreted for a wide range of decaying hidden-sector scenarios, including evaporating primordial black holes and SM-coupled dark photons."}

Two pairs of ears, a pair of blowouts in the north and south along the long axis of this SNR, and a pair of dents compose the point symmetric morphology. The fact that the symmetry axes of two pairs include pairs of opposite structural features in the inner ejecta implies that the shaping is by jets and not due to an interaction with an ambient material. While the JJEM predicts such morphologies, the competing neutrino-driven mechanism cannot account for point-symmetric morphologies. This study provides strong support for the claim that the JJEM is the primary CCSN explosion mechanism."}

The analysis incorporates data from the 2019/20 seasons of the SPT-3G survey in bands centered at 95, 150, and 220 GHz; from the full SPTpol dataset at 150 GHz; and from {\\it Herschel}-SPIRE survey in bands centered at 600 and 857 GHz. We combine data from all the above bands using linear combination (LC) techniques to produce a tSZ or Compton-$y$ map. We modify the LC weights to produce multiple versions of the Compton-$y$ map, including minimum-variance (MV) and foreground-minimized (-min) maps. We measure the auto- and cross-spectra of a subset of these maps in the range $\\ell \\in [500, 5000]$. While this power spectrum includes contributions from signals other than tSZ, we present numerous checks to show that the most challenging foreground signal, the cosmic infrared background (CIB) is much lower than the desired tSZ signal in the scales of interest in this work. The final tSZ power spectrum is measured at $9.3σ$ with both the MV and CIB-min maps. Our results are consistent with those reported in other CMB surveys across the literature. Using the difference in the tSZ power spectrum from MV and CIB-min maps, we reconstruct the scale-dependent tSZ-CIB cross-correlation $ρ_{\\ell}^{\\rm tSZ \\times CIB}$, finding $3.1σ$ evidence for a nonzero correlation coefficient that is positive on large scales and approaches zero for $\\ell > 2500$. This result represents the deepest tSZ maps ever produced and provides new constraints that can help refine astrophysical feedback mechanisms and models of the intracluster medium."}

Their uniformity is credited to their single origin as thermonuclear explosions of White dwarf (WD) stars. Nevertheless, some SNe Ia break this regularity. Prominently, the Iax subclass are less energetic and remarkably diverse, raising questions about their progenitor systems. While no progenitor system of a normal SN Ia has ever been detected, a luminous blue star was identified in pre-explosion images of the site of the bright SN Iax SN 2012Z, suggested to be a helium giant companion star acting as a mass donor to a WD SN progenitor. This is in line with models of weak mass accretion of a WD from a binary companion, producing an explosion that does not fully disrupt the star. However, these models fail to explain the properties of the faintest Type Iax explosions, suggesting either they originate from other WD binary systems, or even from massive progenitor stars. Here, we present the faint SN Iax SN 2024vjm - possibly the faintest supernova observed to date. Using a deep pre-explosion image taken by the recently launched Euclid space mission, we show that its progenitor system must be fainter than the helium giant SN Iax progenitor candidate of SN 2012Z, as well as that of the luminous red companion or remnant of the faint SN 2008ha, and may require a subdwarf helium star as a mass donor. The deep image also provides strong arguments against a massive star origin for this faint supernova. Our observations argue that SN 2024vjm is a WD explosion, but we find that remarkably faint SNe Iax fade more slowly than bright ones, i.e., they evolve in an opposite manner from the famous Phillips relation that makes regular SNe Ia cosmological candles."}

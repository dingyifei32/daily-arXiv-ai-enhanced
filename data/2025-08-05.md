TL;DR: 论文分析了Cassiopeia A（Cas A）超新星遗迹的X射线光谱数据，重点关注XRISM任务观测的两个区域（SE和NW），探讨了空间-光谱混合效应、光谱拟合方法及原子数据库版本对结果的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cas A是银河系中最年轻的核心坍缩超新星遗迹，X射线光谱丰富，是研究高分辨率X射线光谱的理想目标。论文旨在分析XRISM任务观测的数据，探讨光谱拟合中的关键问题。

Method: 通过XRISM任务观测Cas A的SE和NW区域，分析空间-光谱混合效应，使用AtomDB和SPEX软件的不同版本拟合光谱，比较结果差异。

Result: 发现Ni丰度在不同原子数据库版本间差异显著（最多相差3倍），SE和NW区域的元素丰度比（如Ti/Fe、Mn/Fe、Ni/Fe）存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 研究强调了原子数据库版本对光谱分析的重要性，并揭示了Cas A不同区域的元素丰度差异，为超新星遗迹的化学演化提供了新见解。

Abstract: Cassiopeia A (Cas A) is the youngest known core-collapse supernova remnant
(SNR) in the Galaxy and is perhaps the best-studied SNR in X-rays. Cas A has a
line-rich spectrum dominated by thermal emission and given its high flux, it is
an appealing target for high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy. Cas A was observed
at two different locations during the Performance Verification phase of the
XRISM mission, one location in the southeastern part (SE) of the remnant and
one in the northwestern part (NW). This paper serves as an overview of these
observations and discusses some of the issues relevant for the analysis of the
data. We present maps of the so-called ``spatial-spectral mixing'' effect due
to the fact that the XRISM point-spread function is larger than a pixel in the
Resolve calorimeter array. We analyze spectra from two bright, on-axis regions
such that the effects of spatial-spectral mixing are minimized. We find that it
is critical to include redshifts/blueshifts and broadening of the emission
lines in the two thermal components to achieve a reasonable fit given the high
spectral resolution of the Resolve calorimeter. We fit the spectra with two
versions of the AtomDB atomic database (3.0.9 and 3.1.0) and two versions of
the SPEX (3.08.00 and 3.08.01*) spectral fitting software. Overall we find good
agreement between AtomDB 3.1.0 and SPEX 3.08.01* for the spectral models
considered in this paper. The most significant difference we found between
AtomDB 3.0.9 and 3.1.0 and between AtomDB 3.1.0 and SPEX 3.08.01* is the Ni
abundance, with the new atomic data favoring a considerably lower (up to a
factor of 3) Ni abundance. Both regions exhibit significantly enhanced
abundances compared to Solar values indicating that supernova ejecta dominate
the emission in these regions. We find that the abundance ratios of Ti/Fe,
Mn/Fe, \& Ni/Fe are significantly lower in the NW than the SE.

TL;DR: 利用12年IceCube数据研究宇宙射线μ子各向异性，发现低能和高能μ子各向异性特征差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索宇宙射线μ子在不同能量下的各向异性特征，验证IceCube重建能力及宇宙射线扩散模型。

Method: 通过恒星时调制、角分布分析、傅里叶分析和全天空HEALPix映射对比低能和高能μ子各向异性，使用高斯和幂律拟合评估能量分布。

Result: 低能μ子表现出强偶极和大尺度各向异性，高能μ子各向异性较弱且局部化；能量分布符合高斯模型。

Conclusion: 结果证实能量依赖性各向异性，支持宇宙射线扩散模型。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive, energy-resolved study of cosmic-ray muon
anisotropy using 12 years (2011-2023) of data from the IceCube Neutrino
Observatory, comprising 7.92 x 10^11 events in the 13 TeV to 5.3 PeV energy
range. Dividing the spectrum at log-scale energy 5 GeV, we contrast low- and
high-energy anisotropy features via sidereal modulation, angular profiles,
Fourier analysis, and full-sky HEALPix mapping. Gaussian and power-law fits to
energy distributions are evaluated using chi-squared, reduced chi-squared, and
Bayesian Information Criterion. Results show strong dipolar and large-scale
anisotropy at low energies, likely due to geomagnetic and atmospheric effects,
while high-energy muons display weaker, more localized structures consistent
with reduced scattering and source-related anisotropy. Energy distributions are
well fit by Gaussians, especially in the 6.5 to 100 bin, validating IceCube's
reconstruction at PeV scales. These findings confirm energy-dependent
anisotropy and support cosmic-ray diffusion models.

*Luobin Tang,Xiaohong Yang,Defu Bu*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究了特殊相对论效应对线力驱动风的影响，发现这些效应显著削弱了风的强度和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨特殊相对论效应对AGN中超快流出体（UFOs）线力驱动风的影响。

Method: 通过数值模拟分析特殊相对论效应（盘旋转对辐射场的影响和辐射拖曳效应）对线力驱动风的作用。

Result: 考虑特殊相对论效应后，线力驱动风的强度显著减弱，最大速度降低20%-70%，质量流出率和动能功率显著减少。

Conclusion: 特殊相对论效应显著削弱了线力驱动风的性能。

Abstract: Ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) with mildly relativistic velocities are frequently
observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The line-force-driving mechanism is
often taken as a potential mechanism for driving UFOs. Due to the
line-force-driven winds moving at mildly relativistic velocities, the special
relativistic effects become important.There are two special relativistic
effects: one is the influence of the disc rotation on the radiation field; the
other is the radiation-drag effect. We wish to study the influence of the
special relativistic effects on the line-force-driven winds, and we performed
numerical simulations to investigate this.We find that the line-force-driven
winds are significantly weakened when the special relativistic effects are
considered. Compared with the case without special relativistic effects, when
special relativistic effects are considered the winds are closer to the disc
surface, the maximum speed of winds is reduced by $\sim$20 percent--70 percent,
and the mass outflow rate and the kinetic power is significantly reduced.

### [4] [Can cosmic rays explain the high ionisation rates in the Galactic centre?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01344)
*Sruthiranjani Ravikularaman,Sarah Recchia,Vo Hong Minh Phan,Stefano Gabici*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文研究了银河系中心分子带（CMZ）的高电离率，发现低能宇宙射线（CRs）无法单独解释这一现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMZ的高电离率（2e-14 s-1）远超银河系其他区域，传统认为高密度CRs是主要原因，但未观测到相应的高能伽马射线。

Method: 通过伽马射线和无线电数据推导高能CR注入谱，并添加低能成分，数值求解CR传输方程。

Result: 所有测试的CR注入情景中，维持观测电离率所需的能量过高。

Conclusion: CRs不能是CMZ中唯一的电离源。

Abstract: The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), located in the centre of the Milky Way, is
a roughly cylindrical structure of molecular gas extending up to parsecs around
the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*. The average H2 ionisation rate in
the CMZ is estimated to be 2e-14 s-1, which is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher
than anywhere else in the Galaxy. Due to the high gas density in this region,
electromagnetic radiation is rapidly absorbed, leaving low-energy cosmic rays
(CRs) as the only effective ionising agents. Hence, a high CR density has been
invoked to explain such high ionisation rates. However, a corresponding excess
in gamma rays, which would result from interactions of high-energy CRs, has not
been observed. This suggests that the supposed excess exists only in the
low-energy CR spectrum. To constrain this unknown low-energy component, we
first derive the high-energy CR injection spectra using gamma-ray and radio
data, to which we add various low-energy components. We then propagate these
injection spectra by numerically solving the CR transport equation using a
Crank-Nicolson scheme. Testing multiple CR injection scenarios, we find that
the energy required to sustain the observed ionisation rates is excessively
high in every case. We conclude that CRs cannot be the exclusive ionising
agents in the CMZ.

Conclusion: Dark100有望通过优化设计和背景抑制方法，实现高灵敏度探测目标科学现象。

Abstract: Dark100 is a planned array of six telescopes, using the Panoramic Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence (PANOSETI) telescope system. It will operate as
an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope array, with a telescope design and
array layout optimized for accessing gamma rays with tens of TeV to PeV
energies. The science goals of Dark100 include the search for ultra-heavy dark
matter, observations of Galactic Pevatrons, and the search for ultra-fast
optical transients. Rejection of background cosmic rays is key to the
sensitivity of the array. We present a first study of gamma/hadron separation
based on simulated gamma rays and protons, focusing on the impact of the
hadronic background models used in CORSIKA.

Result: 观测到吸积率波动导致的强烈变异性，波动振幅衰减且耀发周期缩短，支持外盘波动传播模型。

Conclusion: 研究将理论预测与时间域观测结合，为吸积盘动态过程提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Propagating fluctuations within accretion disks are known to induce
multi-wavelength variability across diverse timescales. While these
fluctuations have been widely invoked to explain rapid timing phenomena within
the inner disk region in the frequency domain, observational signatures of
outer-disk fluctuations propagating in the time domain remain sparse. Here, we
present an analysis of observations by the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope
(HXMT) during the 2023 outburst of the newly discovered low-mass black hole
X-ray binary Swift J1727.8-1613. Follow-up, high-cadence monitoring reveals
intense variability in disk emission, attributable to fluctuations in the
accretion rate. These disk fluctuations exhibit damped amplitudes and shortened
flare periods. We interpret these features as observational evidence of
fluctuations originating at and propagating from large radii, supported by
fitting the disk light curves with a propagating fluctuation model.
Furthermore, we propose that a plausible mechanism driving these fluctuations
is the cyclical propagation of heating and cooling fronts in the context of the
disk instability model. This work bridges theoretical predictions with
time-domain observations, offering critical insights into the dynamic processes
governing accretion disks.

Result: 发现显著的喷射物速度差异，钙II高速特征可能源于电离抑制，支持延迟爆炸模型。

Conclusion: SN 2024gy的观测结果支持延迟爆炸模型，并表明外层喷射物中氢混合较少。

Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2024gy, a Type Ia
supernova (SN Ia) exhibiting high-velocity features (HVFs) in its early-time
spectra. This SN reaches a peak $B$-band magnitude of $-19.25 \pm 0.28$ mag and
subsequently declines by $\Delta m_{15}(B) \approx 1.12$ mag, consistent with
the luminosity-width relation characteristic of normal SNe Ia. Based on the
peak thermal luminosity of $(1.2 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, we
estimate that $0.57 \pm 0.14~\rm M_{\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni was synthesized during
the explosion. Our dense early spectral monitoring revealed significant
velocity disparities within the ejecta. Notably, absorption features from the
\CaII\ near-infrared triplet were observed at velocities exceeding 25,000 km
s$^{-1}$, while the \SiII\, \ld 6355 line velocity at the same epoch was
significantly lower at $\sim$ 16,000 km s$^{-1}$. This velocity disparity
likely reflects distinct ionization states of intermediate-mass elements in the
outermost layers. The prominent \CaII\, HVFs may originate from ionization
suppression within the highest-velocity ejecta, potentially indicative of
minimal hydrogen mixing in a delayed-detonation explosion scenario.
Additionally, the Ni/Fe ratio derived from the nebular spectrum of SN 2024gy
provides further support for this model.

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic millisecond-duration signals which
encode otherwise unattainable information on the plasma which permeates our
Universe, providing insights into magnetic fields and gas distributions. Here
we report the discovery of FRB 20240304B originating at redshift 2.148 +/-
0.001 corresponding to just 3 billion years after the Big Bang. FRB 2024030 was
detected with the MeerKAT radio telescope and localized to a low-mass, clumpy,
star forming galaxy using the James Webb Space Telescope. This discovery
doubles the redshift reach of localized FRBs and probes ionized baryons across
~80% of cosmic history. Its sightline, intersecting the Virgo Cluster and a
foreground group, reveals magnetic field complexity over many gigaparsec
scales. Our observations establish FRB activity during the peak of cosmic star
formation and demonstrate that FRBs can probe galaxy formation during the most
active era in cosmic time.

Motivation: 探讨强磁场中子星在外部扭矩和形变作用下的旋转演化，揭示自由进动和磁扭矩对磁倾角分布及脉冲星制动指数的影响。

Method: 通过模拟三轴形变孤立中子星的演化，结合磁场衰减，分析自由进动和磁扭矩的共同作用。

Result: 自由进动和磁扭矩导致磁倾角分布显著展宽，形成旋转轴与磁轴不重合的极限环状态，并解释脉冲星制动指数的周期性振荡。

Conclusion: 自由进动与磁扭矩共同作用是中子星旋转演化的重要机制，对理解脉冲星观测现象具有重要意义。

Abstract: The rotational evolution of a strongly magnetized neutron star (NS),
accreting or isolated, is driven by external torques of different nature. In
addition to the torques, even the tiniest deformations of the NS crust can
affect its rotation through asymmetries in its inertia tensor. Several factors
may be responsible for the deformations, including strong magnetic fields,
internal stresses, or local heating. The main effect produced by the
deformations is the so-called free precession: the motion of the rotational
axis with respect to the crust. We consider the evolution of a triaxially
deformed isolated NS with a strong dipolar magnetic field for a broad range of
parameters, taking into account the magnetic field decay. We show that the
combination of pulsar torques and free precession results in a considerable
broadening of the distribution of magnetic obliquity angles (the angle between
the magnetic and rotational axes) and creates a population of objects where the
rotational axis does not align with the magnetic axis at all but enters a
limit-cycle regime. The combination of free precession and magnetic torques can
also explain the observed distribution in pulsar braking indices by creating a
periodic oscillation in the magnetic obliquity.

Motivation: 研究BL Lac天体OJ 287的喷流结构及其物理特性，以理解其高能辐射机制和超大质量黑洞双星系统的模型约束。

Method: 使用RadioAstron和地面27台射电望远镜进行22 GHz观测，结合正则化最大似然成像方法解析喷流结构，辅以43 GHz多频段观测分析喷流演化。

Abstract: We present space-based very long baseline interferometry observations of the
BL Lac type object OJ 287 taken with RadioAstron at 22 GHz on April 25, 2016,
in conjunction with a ground array comprising 27 radio telescopes. We detect
ground-space fringes at projected baselines extending up to 4.6 Earth
diameters, which allowed us to image the jet in OJ 287 with an angular
resolution of ~47 {\mu}as. Applying an advanced regularized maximum likelihood
imaging method, we resolved the innermost jet structure with a complex
morphology at a resolution of ~15 {\mu}as (~0.1 pc projected distance). For the
first time, due to a favorable geometrical position of the jet in tandem with
high data quality, we detect multiple sharp bends that form a "ribbon-like" jet
structure that extends down to 1 mas. Two-dimensional Gaussian model-fitting
reveals regions of the jet with brightness temperatures of more than 10^13 K,
indicative of strong Doppler boosting. Polarimetric imaging reveals that the
electric vector position angles are predominantly perpendicular to the
innermost jet direction, implying a dominant poloidal magnetic field component
near the central engine. Complementary multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array
observations at 43 GHz provide a multifrequency view of the jet evolution.
Ridgeline analysis of the 43 GHz data shows significant variations in the jet
position angle from 2014 to 2017, behavior consistent with a rotating helical
jet structure. Finally, we confirm the emergence of a new jet component (B15 or
K), which may be associated with the source's first TeV flare, and offer new
observational constraints relevant to models involving a supermassive black
hole binary.

TL;DR: 研究通过多时期观测分析低爱丁顿比（<10^-3）下低光度活动星系核（AGN）的吸积流结构，发现其光谱能量分布（SED）演化与X射线双星类似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低爱丁顿比下AGN的吸积流结构尚不明确，需通过多时期观测验证其SED特性是否与X射线双星相似。

Method: 对三个低爱丁顿比（<10^-3）的CL类星体进行第二时期的UV和X射线观测，结合HST、Chandra及光学光谱数据。

Result: 三个CL类星体光度均变化，且光学-X射线谱指数α_OX与爱丁顿比呈负相关（越亮越硬），与X射线双星行为一致。

Conclusion: AGN吸积流在低爱丁顿比下的行为与X射线双星相似，支持两者吸积状态类似的观点。

Abstract: The structure of accretion flows in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei
(AGN) at low Eddington ratios (~10^-2 to 10^-3) are poorly-understood, and can
be probed using the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of faded changing-look
(CL) quasars. Previous results using single-epoch X-ray and rest-frame UV
observations of samples of faded CL quasars suggest that their SED properties
at low Eddington ratios display similarities to X-ray binaries fading from
outburst. However, more robust tests demand multi-epoch observations that can
trace the temporal behavior of the SEDs of individual AGN at low Eddington
ratios. Here, we perform this test, by obtaining a second epoch of UV and X-ray
observations of a sample of three faded CL quasars with bolometric Eddington
ratios of <10^-3, using a combination of contemporaneous HST UV imaging,
Chandra X-ray observations, and optical spectroscopy. We find that all three CL
quasars varied in luminosity, and their optical-to-X-ray spectral indices
alpha_OX all individually display a negative (harder-when-brighter) correlation
with Eddington ratio. This SED evolution is also often observed in X-ray
binaries at low Eddington ratios, and adds to the growing evidence that AGN
accretion flows behave analogously to X-ray binaries across all accretion
states.

Result: HAWC数据显示3-146 TeV的辐射，支持扩展源模型；Fermi-LAT发现软谱点源；XMM-Newton未检测到X射线源。宽带光谱支持脉冲星风星云模型，磁场上限约1.5 μG。

Conclusion: LHAASO J2108+5157的辐射特性符合脉冲星和脉冲星风星云系统的模型，X射线上限对磁场强度提供了严格限制。

Abstract: We report observations of the ultra-high-energy gamma-ray source LHAASO
J2108$+$5157, utilizing VERITAS, HAWC, \emph{Fermi}-LAT, and
\textit{XMM-Newton}. VERITAS has collected $\sim$ 40 hours of data that we used
to set ULs to the emission above 200 GeV. The HAWC data, collected over $\sim
2400$ days, reveal emission between 3 and 146 TeV, with a significance of
$7.5~\sigma$, favoring an extended source model. The best-fit spectrum measured
by HAWC is characterized by a simple power-law with a spectral index of
$2.45\pm0.11_{stat}$. \emph{Fermi}-LAT analysis finds a point source with a
very soft spectrum in the LHAASO J2108+5157 region, consistent with the
4FGL-DR3 catalog results. The \textit{XMM-Newton} analysis yields a null
detection of the source in the 2 - 7 keV band. The broadband spectrum can be
interpreted as a pulsar and a pulsar wind nebula system, where the GeV
gamma-ray emission originates from an unidentified pulsar, and the X-ray and
TeV emission is attributed to synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton
scattering of electrons accelerated within a pulsar wind nebula. In this
leptonic scenario, our X-ray upper limit provides a stringent constraint on the
magnetic field, which is $\lesssim 1.5\ \mu$G.

Conclusion: pp相互作用是解释能谱硬化的最可能机制，但双区轻子模型也是备选方案。

Abstract: Recent LHAASO observations hint at potential spectral hardening around 20 TeV
in M87's very high energy (VHE) emission, suggesting a possible new radiation
component. In this work, we construct averaged multiwavelength SEDs by
combining data from Chandra and Swift-UVOT/XRT covering the same period as the
LHAASO detection to investigate the origin of this feature. We test several
radiation mechanisms, including the pp interaction, proton synchrotron
emission, photomeson process and two-zone leptonic model. We find that only the
pion decay gamma rays in pp interactions can interpret this feature in the
framework of the one-zone model. With analytical analysis, we prove that proton
synchrotron emission cannot generate a hard spectrum above 0.17~TeV. For
photomeson model, it requires an emission zone compressed near the
Schwarzschild radius of the central supermassive black hole, incompatible with
broadband optical-GeV spectral constraints. In addition, the two-zone leptonic
model also emerges as a viable alternative.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了广义相对论（GR）对νp过程产率的影响，发现GR效应显著提高了关键同位素的产量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决太阳系中某些质子富集同位素（如Mo和Ru）起源的长期谜题，探索νp过程在超新星核心坍缩中的作用。

Method: 比较牛顿力学和完全GR框架下νp过程的产率，分析GR效应（如中微子能量引力偏移和后牛顿引力势修正）对种子核产生的影响。

Result: GR效应显著提高了关键同位素（如92,94Mo和96,98Ru）的产量，尤其在18M⊙模型中，92Nb的丰度增加了25倍。

Conclusion: GR效应在νp过程中起重要作用，为未来超新星模拟提供了优化条件的指导。

Abstract: The origin of certain proton-rich isotopes in the solar system, particularly
$^{92,94}{\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\rm Ru}$, has been a long-standing puzzle. A
promising explanation is the $\nu p$-process, which is posited to operate in
the neutrino-driven outflows that form inside core-collapse supernovae after
shock revival. Recent studies have identified several relevant physical effects
that influence the yields of this process. The impact of General Relativity
(GR) on the $\nu p$-process yields, however, remains unexplored. In this work,
we perform a comparative analysis of the time-integrated yields of the $p$
nuclei up to $A \lesssim 105$ in Newtonian and fully GR neutrino-driven
outflows, using a detailed model of a time-evolving outflow profile. The two
main GR effects are the gravitational shift of neutrino energies and
post-Newtonian corrections to the gravitational potential. These effects
together suppress the production of seed nuclei, significantly boosting the
$\nu p$-process yields in our 18 $M_\odot$ progenitor model. Most of the
production of the crucial $^{92,94}{\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\rm Ru}$ $p$
isotopes in this model occurs in an optimal time window, 1-3 seconds after
shock revival. Interestingly, the same does not apply to the shielded isotope
$^{92}{\rm Nb}$, a large fraction of which is produced in the subsequent
ejecta. The impact of GR on this isotope is especially large, with its final
abundance boosted by a factor of 25 compared to a Newtonian calculation. In our
12.75 $M_\odot$ model, an additional GR effect is observed: the outflow
transitions to the supersonic regime several seconds into the explosion,
causing the yields to drop. This study quantifies the important role GR effects
play in the $\nu p$-process and provides guidance for identifying optimal
conditions in future self-consistent supernova simulations.

Result: 倾斜磁场显著降低喷流功率，但粒子加速效率不受影响。

Conclusion: 喷流功率弱的黑洞仍可能是非热辐射和宇宙线的高效源。

Abstract: Rotating black holes are known to launch relativistic jets and accelerate
particles provided they accrete a magnetized plasma. However, it remains
unclear how the global magnetic field orientation affects the jet powering
efficiency. Here, we propose the first kinetic study of a collisionless plasma
around a Kerr black hole that is embedded in a magnetic field inclined with
respect to the black hole's spin axis. Using three-dimensional
general-relativistic particle-in-cell simulations, we show that while oblique
magnetic field configurations significantly reduce the jet power, particle
acceleration remains highly efficient regardless. This suggests that black
holes producing a weak jet could still be bright sources of nonthermal
radiation and cosmic rays.

Motivation: 研究Terzan 5球状星团中的X射线源，以了解其qLMXBs的分布和特性，并探索与中子星质量的关系。

Method: 使用737 ks的Chandra数据，通过X射线颜色和光谱拟合分离前景源、qLMXBs和硬光谱源。

Result: 发现22个候选qLMXBs，其中50%以上中子星热成分贡献超过80%的光度，并观察到1.75 keV的异常光谱特征。

Conclusion: Terzan 5的高恒星相互作用率解释了其qLMXBs的丰富性，中子星质量分布与观测一致，成功识别了两个毫秒脉冲星的X射线对应体。

Abstract: We analyze photometry, spectra, and variability of over 100 faint X-ray
sources in the globular cluster Terzan 5, using 737 ks of Chandra data. X-ray
colors and spectral fitting allow clear separation of foreground sources (with
less extinction than the cluster), quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries (qLMXBs),
and sources with harder spectra. We identify 22 candidate qLMXBs, over twice
that found in any other cluster. This is consistent with Terzan 5's stellar
interaction rate, the highest among Galactic globular clusters. We do not see
qLMXBs dominated by thermal emission below $L_X\sim10^{32}$ erg/s, though
qLMXBs with stronger nonthermal emission could be missed. We find that more
than 50 % of the qLMXB sources have neutron star thermal component contributing
over 80 % of the total luminosity. We report an unusual spectral feature around
1.75 keV in the combined spectrum of Ter 5 X-3. The concentration of the qLMXBs
within the cluster is consistent with that of a population of mass $1.46 \pm
0.14$ M$_\odot$. We identify secure X-ray counterparts to millisecond pulsars
Terzan 5 ar and Terzan 5 at, using positional coincidence and orbital X-ray
light curves matching those expected for spider pulsars.

TL;DR: 通过数值模拟研究了中子星吸积的能量流动和辐射效率，发现强磁场（100 GigaGauss）的能量效率约为弱磁场的50%，且辐射效率更低。弱磁场（<30 GigaGauss）的模拟结果与ULXs观测一致。高吸积率导致更强外流、更高动能效率和更低辐射效率。

Motivation: 研究中子星作为超亮X射线源（ULXs）的能量流动和辐射效率，探索磁场强度和吸积率对其影响。

Method: 采用辐射广义相对论磁流体动力学（GRRMHD）模拟，测试6种磁场强度（10-100 GigaGauss）和3种吸积率（100、300、1000 Eddington单位）。

Result: 强磁场（100 GigaGauss）能量效率为弱磁场的50%，辐射效率更低；弱磁场（<30 GigaGauss）模拟与ULXs观测一致；高吸积率导致更强外流、更高动能效率和更低辐射效率。

Conclusion: 磁场强度和吸积率显著影响中子星的辐射效率和能量流动，弱磁场和高吸积率更符合ULXs的观测特征。

Abstract: We investigate numerically the energy flow and radiation efficiency of
accreting neutron stars as potential ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). We
perform ten simulations {in radiative general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics
(GRRMHD)}, exploring six different magnetic dipole strengths ranging from 10 to
100 GigaGauss, along with three accretion rates, 100, 300, and 1000 Eddington
luminosity units. Our results show that the energy efficiency in simulations
with a strong magnetic dipole of 100 GigaGauss is approximately half that of
simulations with a magnetic dipole an order of magnitude weaker. Consequently,
radiation efficiency is lower in simulations with stronger magnetic dipoles. We
also demonstrate that outflow power increases as the magnetic dipole weakens,
resulting in stronger beaming in simulations with weaker magnetic dipoles. As a
result of beaming, simulations with magnetic dipole strengths below 30
GigaGauss exhibit apparent luminosities consistent with those observed in ULXs.
As for the accretion rates, we find that higher accretion rates lead to more
powerful outflows, higher kinetic efficiency, and lower radiation efficiency
compared to those of lower accretion rate simulations.

Motivation: 通过精确测量中子星质量和半径，约束核物质状态方程，探讨奇异夸克星的可能性。

Method: 利用贝叶斯假设排序分析NICER数据，比较中子星和奇异夸克星模型。

Result: 奇异夸克星模型优于其他中子星模型，排除了一个奇异夸克物质模型。

Conclusion: 支持奇异夸克星的存在，建议在分析天体物理数据时考虑其可能性。

Abstract: Precise measurements of neutron star masses and radii by the NICER mission
impose important constraints on the nuclear equation of state. The most recent
NICER measurement of PSR J0614-3329 reported an equatorial radius of $R_{eq} =
10.29^{+1.01}_{-0.86}$ km for a mass of $M = 1.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07} M_{\odot}$.
Considering all the NICER measurements to date, we demonstrate using Bayesian
hypothesis ranking that strange quark stars are preferred over all the
physically motivated models of neutron stars compatible with this low radius.
This provides a strong case for the possible existence of strange quark stars,
suggesting that they should be considered among the population of compact stars
during analyses of astrophysical data. Using a wide sample of equations of
state, we report the nucleonic equations of state that best fit current
observations and rule out one model of strange quark matter.

Motivation: 探索暴胀模型与当前观测数据的兼容性，尤其是再加热阶段的动力学特征。

Method: 采用半解析方法，通过方程将暴胀动力学与再加热联系起来，计算相关宇宙学量，并考虑不同的衰变通道。

Result: 在r-n_s和T_re-n_s平面上展示了模型参数与P-ACT-LB2区域的接近程度，结果与其他研究一致。

Conclusion: 模型在特定参数范围内与观测数据兼容，尤其在P-ACT-LB2区域附近有较好表现。

Abstract: We study two classes of single-field inflationary models - a generalization
of the alpha-attractor and the alpha-Starobinsky model - and examine their
compatibility with current observational data from Planck, ACT DR6, and BAO
measurements from DESI DR2. Our analysis focuses on the reheating phase that
follows inflation, characterized by the equation-of-state parameter omega_re,
the reheating temperature T_re, and the number of e-folds N_re. We use a
semi-analytical approach based on an equation linking inflationary dynamics to
reheating, allowing us to compute the inflaton value at horizon crossing phi_k
and other related cosmological quantities. We consider different decay channels
for the inflaton: gravitational, Yukawa, and scalar. We are particularly
interested in studying these models in the r-n_s and T_re-n_s planes,
especially in regions close to the P-ACT-LB2 combination, which is the area
most distant from the Planck data. To do this, we explore a wide range of
values for the model parameters and show the graphs where the closest
approximation to the P-ACT-LB2 region occurs. Other authors have already
carried out related work; where there is overlap, our results are consistent
with those obtained by other means.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过结合不同宇宙时期的观测数据，更全面地测试$f(T,B)$引力模型，验证其对广义相对论的修正是否可行。

Method: 利用弱相互作用冻结温度偏差和宇宙计时器直接测量的哈勃参数数据，通过最小化联合卡方统计量，拟合模型参数。

Result: 联合分析显著优化了参数约束，支持基于挠率的广义相对论修正的可行性。

Conclusion: 研究为未来利用新观测数据评估$f(T,B)$引力模型提供了方法论支持，并验证了其一致性。

Abstract: This study proposes a unified framework comprising two complementary
approaches to constrain three functional forms of $f(T,B)$ gravity, namely the
linear, quadratic, and general power law models, by jointly utilizing early and
late Universe observations. First, we impose bounds on deviations in the weak
interaction freeze-out temperature, informed by the latest measurements of the
primordial helium-4 mass fraction. Second, we incorporate direct Hubble
parameter data, $H(\mathcal{z})$, obtained from Cosmic Chronometers in the
redshift range $0.07\le\mathcal{z}\le2.0$, to trace the expansion history of
the Universe. By minimizing a combined chi-square statistic across both
datasets, we derive the best-fit values and confidence intervals for each model
parameter. The joint analysis significantly refines the parameter constraints
compared to methods based solely on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, thereby offering
a more robust test of $f(T,B)$ gravity across cosmic epochs. The results
support the viability of torsion-based modifications to General Relativity and
provide a consistent methodology for future evaluation using upcoming
observational data.

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: DESI的BAO测量与Planck的CMB数据在$\Omega_\mathrm{m}$上存在张力，本文通过弦理论模型解释这种张力，并解决了$w_0w_a$CDM模型中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DESI-$\Lambda$CDM与Planck-$\Lambda$CDM在$\Omega_\mathrm{m}$上的张力，并探讨暗能量（DE）的动态行为。

Method: 使用弦理论启发的模型，其中暗物质（DM）通过quintessence场与重力非最小耦合。

Result: 模型显示quintessence不会穿过$w=-1$，而是早期表现为标准CDM，晚期趋近于宇宙常数，且非最小耦合在$3\sigma$置信水平上更优。

Conclusion: 该模型不仅解决了$\Omega_\mathrm{m}$和$S_8$张力，还避免了$w_0w_a$CDM模型中的虚假行为。

Abstract: The Planck measurement of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) has
established the $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model as the
concordant model along with other observations. However, recent measurements of
baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument (DESI) collaboration have renewed the matter fraction
$\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension between DESI-$\Lambda$CDM and Planck-$\Lambda$CDM.
Directly reconciling this CMB-BAO tension with a dynamical DE in
Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization seems to imply a crossing of
the equation-of-state through $w=-1$ at low redshifts. In this letter, we will
illustrate with a string-theory-motivated model that, when the DM non-minimally
couples to gravity via a quintessence field, a misidentification with the
$w_0w_a$CDM model would exactly fake such a crossing behavior, while the
coupled quintessence never crosses $w=-1$ but behaves as a standard CDM in the
early Universe and approaches a cosmological constant in the late Universe.
Such a non-minimal coupling is preferred over $3\sigma$ confidence level. The
worsened $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension and $S_8$ tension in the $w_0w_a$CDM model
are also resolved in our model.

Abstract: Primordial non-Gaussianity is predicted by various inflationary models, and
N-body simulations are a crucial tool for studying its imprints on large-scale
structure. In this work, we present \texttt{GENGARS} ( GEnerator of
Non-Gaussian ARbitrary Shapes), a framework for generating accurate
non-Gaussian initial conditions for N-body simulations. It builds upon the
formulation introduced by Wagner \& Verde (2012), enabling to generate a
primordial gravitational potential with a desired separable bispectrum
$B_{\Phi}(k_1,k_2,k_3)$. For the local, equilateral and orthogonal non-Gaussian
templates, we benchmark our method against the well-established
\texttt{2LPT-PNG} code. We show that \texttt{GENGARS} achieves improved
accuracy and lower noise by suppressing spurious contributions to the
primordial power spectrum. This paper aims at presenting the method,
quantifying its performance and illustrating the benefits and applicable use
cases over existing approaches.

Result: 蓝倾斜谱指数与PBH形成和聚类的质量范围一一对应；聚类概率随距离渐近减小，高临界密度阈值抑制聚类丰度。

Conclusion: 增强的功率谱促进PBH形成和聚类，但高临界密度阈值会抑制聚类。

Abstract: We investigate the clustering of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) within the
framework of Excursion Set Theory (EST). The EST formalism is extended to
compute the joint probability of forming PBH pairs within a clustering
distance, based on two stochastic trajectories with a shared history. Our
results show that an enhanced power spectrum not only increases the formation
of PBHs in specific mass ranges but also enhances their clustering probability.
We find a one-to-one correspondence between the blue-tilted spectral index and
the mass ranges in which PBHs form and cluster. Additionally, we demonstrate
that the clustering probability decreases asymptotically with increasing
clustering distance, while a higher critical density threshold (barrier) leads
to a suppression of clustering abundance.

Method: 研究了两种方法：Wiener滤波器的应用和全多示踪信息的利用，以优化交叉相关分析。

Result: Wiener滤波器可将暗物质湮灭率的灵敏度提高2/2.5倍；多示踪信息利用对50 GeV以下暗物质质量可提升灵敏度至5倍。

Conclusion: Wiener滤波器对较重暗物质效果最佳，而多示踪信息对较轻暗物质更有效，两者结合可显著提升分析灵敏度。

Abstract: Cross-correlations between a gravitational tracer of dark matter and the
contribution to the unresolved gamma-ray background (UGRB) from the radiation
produced by the annihilation of the particles responsible for the dark matter,
have been established as a powerful tool to investigate the particle physics
nature of dark matter. Cross-correlations of the UGRB with galaxy catalogs,
cluster catalogs and weak lensing have indeed been measured. In this paper we
study statistical techniques that could improve the sensitivity of the
cross-correlation techniques on the bounds that can be set to the particle dark
matter physical properties. The two methods that we investigate are the
application of a Wiener filter and the exploitation of the full multi-tracer
information. After identifying the optimal strategies, we show that the
adoption of a Wiener filter in the cross-correlation analysis can improve the
sensitivity to the dark matter annihilation rate by a factor of 2/2.5 as
compared to the standard analysis where no filter is applied. The inclusion of
the full multi-tracer information can improve the sensitivity up to a factor of
5 for dark matter masses below about 50 GeV, the Wiener filter remaining the
best option for heavier dark matter.

Motivation: 利用高灵敏度和高分辨率的新数据，对先前样本进行深入研究，以揭示射电源的形态和频谱特征及其可能的演化。

Method: 通过比较新旧射电数据（如TXS和VCSS调查）及低频GLEAM数据，分析样本的形态、频谱和变异性。

Result: 样本中4%的源由近距离星系形成，8%显示活动重启，20%环境导致瓣变形，11%为年轻源，2%为衰减源；陡峭频谱源比例显著下降。

Conclusion: 低频数据的加入和可能的频谱演化导致陡峭频谱源比例减少，样本分析为远距离射电星系研究提供了新见解。

Abstract: A sample of objects with steep and ultra-steep spectra was prepared from
radio sources of the Cold experiment surveys conducted on the RATAN-600 radio
telescope. It formed the basis for the Big Trio program for searching for
distant radio galaxies. With the advent of high-sensitivity,
high-angular-resolution radio sky surveys, as well as deep optical and infrared
surveys, it became possible to conduct additional studies of the sample. We
refined the morphology and spectra of continuous radio emissions from radio
galaxies.
  A detailed study of the morphological features of the sample sources revealed
that 4 of the sample sources are formed by close radio sources with a distance
of about 60 kpc between the parent galaxies. 8% of the radio sources
demonstrate a restart of activity in the radio range, 20% of the sources are in
an environment that leads to the deformation of the lobes, 11% are young
sources and 2% are fading.
  A high percentage of sources with a variability index greater than 3 is
associated with a large difference in the angular resolution of the compared
TXS and VCSS surveys, as well as an underestimated flux density for some double
sources in the latter survey. Comparison of spectral indices obtained from old
and new data showed that in the studied sample the share of sources with steep
spectra has significantly decreased. Most likely, this is due to the addition
of low-frequency GLEAM data, although for some radio sources a possible
evolution of the continuum spectrum over an interval of several decades is not
excluded -- a shift towards low frequencies.

TL;DR: 论文研究了P_n辐射传输模型在宇宙学模拟中的应用，发现高阶P_n（如P_9）能修正M_1模型的缺陷，并揭示了一个新的M_1模型问题——'暗草帽'。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前宇宙学模拟中的M_1辐射传输模型存在流体行为相关的明显缺陷，如伪源和方向性丢失。P_n模型可能解决这些问题。

Method: 实现P_n辐射传输方法，并与光热化学模块耦合，通过基准测试比较P_n和M_1的性能。

Result: 高阶P_n（如P_9）能修正M_1的缺陷，并在方向性和辐射前沿碰撞方面表现更好。同时发现M_1模型存在'暗草帽'问题。

Conclusion: P_n模型在宇宙学模拟中优于M_1，且揭示了M_1的新问题，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: In current cosmological simulations, the radiative transfer modules generally
rely on the M_1 approximation, which has some glaring flaws related to its
fluid-like behaviour, such as spurious pseudo-sources and loss of
directionality when radiation fronts from different directions collide. P_n,
another moment-based model used in other fields of physics, may correct these
issues. We aim at testing out P_n in an astrophysical setting and compare it to
M_1, in order to see if it can indeed correct M_1's flaws. Also, we want to use
P_n's solutions to better pinpoint M_1 errors. We implement a P_n radiation
transport method and couple it to a photo-thermo-chemistry module to account
for the interaction of ionising radiation with the Hydrogen gas, and benchmark
it using tests for radiative transfer models comparison in astrophysics as
defined in arXiv:astro-ph/0603199. We find that high order P_n (e.g. P_9)
indeed correct M_1's flaws, while faring as well or even better in some aspects
in the tests, in particular when directionality is important or colliding
radiation fronts occur. By comparing P_9 and M_1 radiation fields in an
idealised and cosmological test case, we highlight a new, thus far unreported
artefact of M_1, the 'dark sombrero'. A dark sombrero appears as a spherical
photon-deficit shell around the source. The photon density in dark sombreros
can be underestimated by a factor up to 2-3. They occur in regions where a
source's radiation field connects with that of another source or group of
sources. These basic properties (position and amplitude) of the dark sombreros
may depend on the sources' relative intensities, positions, spatial resolution,
although we have not been able to test this in detail in this study.

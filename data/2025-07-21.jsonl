D", "summary": "We present the first independent re-analysis of the galaxy clustering data\nfrom DESI Data Release 1, utilizing an effective field theory (EFT)-based\nfull-shape model. We analyze the power spectra and bispectra of the public\ncatalogs using a custom-built pipeline based on window-deconvolved\nquasi-optimal estimators, carefully accounting for all relevant systematic\neffects. Compared to the official collaboration analysis, we add the galaxy\npower spectrum hexadecapole and the bispectrum monopole, and also introduce a\nnovel stochastic estimator for fiber collisions, which facilitates robust\nbispectrum analyses. As a first application, we perform an EFT-based full-shape\nanalysis of the DESI power spectra and bispectra in the context of the standard\ncosmological model, $\\Lambda$CDM. Using external priors on the physical baryon\ndensity and the primordial power spectrum tilt, we constrain the matter density\nfraction to $\\Omega_m=0.284\\pm 0.011$, the Hubble constant to $h=0.707\\pm\n0.011$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude to $\\sigma_8=0.811\\pm 0.030$. The\nbispectrum has a noticeable effect on parameter estimation: it sharpens the\nconstraints on $\\sigma_8$ and $\\Omega_m$ by $\\approx 10$\\% and shifts\n$\\Omega_m$ by $\\approx 1\\sigma$ towards the Planck $\\Lambda$CDM value.\nCombining our full-shape likelihood with the official DESI DR2 BAO\nmeasurements, cosmological parameters shift further towards the \\textit{Planck}\nvalues, with $\\Omega_m=0.296\\pm 0.007$, $h=0.688\\pm 0.006$, $\\sigma_8=0.818\\pm\n0.029$ (with tighter constraints obtained in joint analyses). Finally, the\ngalaxy bispectrum data dramatically improves measurements of quadratic bias\nparameters, which are consistent with predictions from halo occupation\ndistribution models. Our work highlights the importance of higher-order\nstatistics and sets the stage for upcoming full-shape analyses of non-minimal\ncosmological models."}

To investigate the differences, we modify the standard\ntorus setup across four BH spins: $a_*=0$, $0.5$, $0.9$, $-0.9$. First, we\nincrease the torus size significantly (pressure maximum at 500 gravitational\nradii), allowing long simulations ($2.8\\times10^5$ gravitational times) without\ngas depletion. These runs reproduce the weak variability seen in smaller tori,\nindicating that a larger dynamic range alone does not cause strong\nfluctuations. We observe moderate suppression of the accretion rate by factors\nof $\\sim 1.6, ~2.5$ for BH spins $a_*=0.5,~0.9$, respectively, compared to\n$a_*=0$. Also, the density profile scales as $\\rho(r)\\propto r^{-1.1}$ for\nprograde BHs. Next, we considerably strengthen the initial magnetic field in\nthe large torus by setting the plasma-$\\beta\\approx 1$. This induces strong\nvariability in the evolution. The jet efficiency in the $a_*=0.9$ model, for\ninstance, now varies by over 3 orders of magnitude, and gas rotation reverses\ndirections. Combining these results with prior studies, we propose that a key\nparameter is the ratio $R$ between the rotational and magnetic energies in the\ninitial state.

Submitted to journal", "summary": "Observations of accreting black hole (BH) systems, such as microquasars and\nsupermassive black holes, often reveal a precessing jet with changing\ndirections, indicating a misaligned accretion flow relative to the BH spin. The\nprecession is commonly attributed to the Lense-Thirring (LT) effect, which\narises from the BH's rotation twisting the surrounding spacetime and accretion\nflow. In the strongly magnetized regime, which is preferred accretion flow\nconditions for M~87$^*$ and likely other jet-producing systems, the large-scale\nmagnetic field can significantly influence the flow dynamics. Here, we perform\nlarge-scale three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulations of tilted accretion onto a rotating BH, and find a\nnever-seen-before new retrograde precession. This precession arises from a\nmagnetic torque on the disk generated by the poloidal magnetic field aligned\nwith the BH's rotation, opposing the LT torque. This finding highlights the\nunique property of highly magnetized accretion flows around BHs and provides a\nnew interpretation of jet precession observed in many systems."}

We derive the cosmology-dependent mapping that relates the linear\n(Lagrangian) and fully non-linear (Eulerian) evolution of the matter density\ncontrast, a central component for accurate theoretical modeling of void\nstatistics. Furthermore, we present a new method for determining the\nshell-crossing epoch across arbitrary cosmological backgrounds, thereby\nextending previous treatments restricted to the Einstein-de Sitter universe.\n  Motivated by recent DESI results hinting at dynamical dark energy, we\ninvestigate void evolution in $ w_0w_a$CDM cosmologies by varying $ w_0$ and\n$w_a$. We also consider the impact of varying the matter density parameter, $\n\\Omega_{\\mathrm{m},0}$. We find that the evolution of isolated, spherically\nsymmetric cosmic voids is most sensitive to $ \\Omega_{\\mathrm{m},0} $ and $ w_0\n$, which can alter the non-linear density contrast by up to 20-30%.

Therefore,\nstudying their emission processes is of general interest for constraining\ncosmological parameters or the behavior of ultra-dense matter. One common\nmethod to analyze electromagnetic data from BNS mergers is to sample a Bayesian\nposterior over the parameters of a physical model for the transient. However,\nsampling the posterior is computationally costly, and because of the many\nlikelihood evaluations needed in this process, detailed models are too\nexpensive to be used directly in inference. In the present article, we address\nthis problem by introducing fiesta, a python package to train machine learning\n(ML) surrogates for GRB afterglow and kilonova models that can accelerate\nlikelihood evaluations. Specifically, we introduce extensive ML surrogates for\nthe state-of-the-art GRB afterglow models afterglowpy and pyblastafterglow, as\nwell as a new surrogate for the KN emission as modeled by the possis code. Our\nsurrogates enable evaluation of the lightcurve posterior within minutes. We\nalso provide built-in posterior sampling capabilities in fiesta that rely on\nthe flowMC package which scale efficiently to higher dimensions when adding up\nto tens of nuisance sampling parameters. Because of its use of the JAX\nframework, fiesta also allows for GPU acceleration during both surrogate\ntraining and posterior sampling. We apply our framework to reanalyze\nAT2017gfo/GRB170817A and GRB211211A using our surrogates, thus employing the\nnew pyblastafterglow model for the first time in Bayesian inference."}

It has been\nrecently proposed that such layers, arising during flux eruption events, can\npower the rapid TeV flares observed from the core of M87. In this scenario,\ninverse Compton scattering of soft radiation from the accretion flow by\nenergetic electron-positron pairs produced near the reconnection layer was\nsuggested as the primary emission mechanism.

In this work, we combine analytic estimates\nwith 3D radiative particle-in-cell simulations of pair-proton plasmas to show\nthat the GeV emission can be naturally explained by synchrotron radiation from\nprotons accelerated in the current sheet. Although the exact proton content of\nthe layer is uncertain, our model remains robust across a broad range of\nproton-to-pair number density ratios. While protons are subdominant in number\ncompared to pairs, our simulations demonstrate that they can be accelerated\nmore efficiently, leading to a self-regulated steady state in which protons\ndominate the energy budget.

We obtained fluences, peak fluxes and\ndurations from the catalogues of GRBs observed by the CGRO-BATSE and Fermi-GBM\ninstruments. We selected the extreme values in slots of equal duration and\nmodelled their distributions by the generalized extreme value (GEV) formalism.\nThe GEV distribution is a limit distribution naturally arising when the number\nof observations is large and is essentially independent of the phenomena\nproducing the observed data. The distributions of extreme values for fluences,\npeak fluxes and durations are consistent with being extracted from a single\npopulation of events but the fluence and peak flux recorded for GRB221009A\nconstitutes a striking exception. The probability to observe such an event,\nassuming it is a cosmological GRB, is low, with a median value of about one\nevent per millennium for the fluence and about one event per century for the\npeak flux."}

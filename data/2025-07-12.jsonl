During the\nobservations GX 349+2 was found mainly in the normal branch. A\nmodel-independent polarimetric analysis yields a polarisation degree of $1.1\\%\n\\pm 0.3\\%$ at a polarisation angle of $29{\\deg} \\pm 7{\\deg}$ in the 2--8 keV\nband, with ${\\sim}4.1\\sigma$ confidence level significance. No variability of\npolarisation in time and flux has been observed, while an energy-resolved\nanalysis shows a complex dependence of polarisation on energy, as confirmed by\na spectropolarimetric analysis. Spectral modeling reveals a dominant disc\nblackbody component and a Comptonising emitting region, with evidence of a\nbroad iron line associated with a reflection component. Spectropolarimetric\nfits suggest differing polarisation properties for the disc and Comptonised\ncomponents, slightly favouring a spreading layer geometry. The polarisation of\nthe Comptonised component exceeds the theoretical expectations, but is in line\nwith the results for other Z-sources with similar inclination. A study of the\nreflection's polarisation is also reported, with polarisation degree ranging\naround 10% depending on the assumptions. Despite GX 349+2's classification as a\nSco-like source, these polarimetric results align more closely with the\nCyg-like system GX 340+0 of similar inclination. This indicates that\npolarisation is governed primarily by accretion state and orbital inclination,\nrather than by the subclass to which the source belongs."}

We combine $N$-body dynamic models of realistic\ndense star clusters with cluster formation histories to estimate the merger\nrate distribution as a function of primary mass for merging BBHs formed in\nthese environments. It has been argued that dense star clusters -- most notably\nold globular clusters -- predominantly produce BBH mergers with primary masses\n$M_p\\approx30\\,M_{\\odot}$. We show that dense star clusters forming at lower\nredshifts -- and thus having higher metallicities -- naturally produce\nlower-mass BBH mergers. We find that cluster BBH mergers span a wide range of\nprimary mass, from about $6\\,M_{\\odot}$ to above $100\\,M_{\\odot}$, with a peak\nnear $8\\,M_{\\odot}$, reproducing the overall merger rate distribution inferred\nfrom gravitational wave detections. Our results show that most low-mass BBH\nmergers (about $95\\%$ with $M_p\\lesssim 20\\,M_{\\odot}$) originate in metal-rich\n($Z \\sim Z_{\\odot}$) dense star clusters, while more massive BBH mergers form\npredominately in metal-poor globular clusters. We also discuss the role of\nhierarchical mergers in shaping the BBH mass distribution. Gravitational wave\ndetection of dynamically-formed low-mass BBH mergers -- potentially\nidentifiable by features such as isotropic spin distributions -- may serve as\nprobes of cluster formation histories in metal-rich environments at low\nredshifts."}

A statistically significant halo-like excess is found with a sharp\npeak around 20 GeV, while its flux is consistent with zero below 2 GeV and\nabove 200 GeV. Examination of the fit residual maps indicates that a\nspherically symmetric halo component fits the map data well. The radial profile\nagrees with annihilation by the smooth NFW density profile, and may be slightly\nshallower than this, especially in the central region. Various systematic\nuncertainties are investigated, but the 20 GeV peak remains significant. In\nparticular, the halo excess with a similar spectrum is detected even relative\nto the LAT standard background model, which does not depend on GALPROP or other\nmodel templates.

The most\nsignificant point in the northern sky aligns with NGC 1068, a Seyfert II\ngalaxy, which shows a 3.5$\\sigma$ excess over background after accounting for\ntrials. The most significant point in the southern sky does not align with any\nsource in the catalog and is not significant after accounting for trials. A\nsearch for the single most significant Gaussian flare at the locations of NGC\n1068, PKS 1424+240, and the southern highest significance point shows results\nconsistent with expectations for steady emission.

However, it\nis challenging to observe directly the last hours of a massive star before\nexplosion, since it is the supernova event that triggers the start of intense\nobservational study. Here we report evidence for a final phase of stellar\nactivity known as a ``shell merger'', an intense shell burning in which the\nO-burning shell swallows its outer C-/Ne-burning shell, deep within the\nprogenitor's interior moments before the supernova explosion. In the violent\nconvective layer created by the shell merger, Ne, which is abundant in the\nstellar O-rich layer, is burned as it is pulled inward, and Si, which is\nsynthesized inside, is transported outward. The remnant still preserves some\ntraces of such Ne-rich downflows and Si-rich upflows in the O-rich layer,\nsuggesting that inhomogeneous shell-merger mixing began just hours ($\\lesssim\n10^4$ s) before its gravitational collapse.

Some compact objects are\npredicted to form via direct collapse, a scenario with negligible mass loss and\nno baryonic ejecta emitted. In this scenario, most of the energy is released\nvia neutrinos, and any resulting natal kick arises from asymmetries in their\nemission. Here I investigate stellar collapse leading to binary black hole (BH)\nformation, with a focus on how the natal kick influences the\ngravitational-wave-driven merger time. Broadly, I find three regimes. For low\nnatal kicks, the effect on the time-to-coalescence is negligible. For moderate\nnatal kicks, if the binary remains bound, up to 50% of binary BHs experience a\ndecrease in their time-to-coalescence by more than an order of magnitude. For\nlarge natal kicks, although most binaries become unbound, those that remain\nbound may acquire retrograde orbits and/or lead to shorter time-to-coalescence.\nFor binary BH mergers, large natal kicks ($\\gtrsim100$ km/s) are hard to\nreconcile with both neutrino natal kicks and the complete collapse scenario.\nThis suggests that retrograde orbits and shortened merger times could only\narise in volatile BH formation scenarios or if spin-axis tossing is at work.\nConsequently, electromagnetic observations of BHs in massive star binaries\nwithin the Local Group offer a more effective means to probe the physics behind\ncomplete collapse. Another promising population for deciphering the complete\ncollapse scenario is that of massive, wide binaries. Although Gaia may help\nshed light on these systems, longer observational baselines will likely be\nneeded to fully understand the roles of neutrino natal kicks and stellar\ncollapse in BH formation."}

The planned design includes 8 cubic kilometers\nof ice instrumented with approximately 10,000 optical sensors, a surface array,\nand a radio array of antennas embedded in the ice laid out sparsely over 500\nkm^2. The radio array provides sensitivity to ultra-high energy neutrinos using\nindependent radio stations that can trigger on Askaryan emission from neutrino\ninteractions in the ice. In this contribution, we present the design for the\nradio array along with its planned implementation, which is expected to\nincrease sensitivity to neutrinos with energies beyond 100PeV by at least an\norder of magnitude over existing arrays. Furthermore, we will quantify the\nexpected science output by presenting measurement forecasts for the main\nscience cases of diffuse flux and point source discovery, as well as\ncross-section and flavor measurements."}

In previous iterations of\nthis work, we proposed an approach for UHECR astronomy based on Bayesian\ninference through explicit modelling of propagation and magnetic deflection\neffects. The event-by-event mass information is expected to provide tighter\nconstraints on these parameters and to help identify unknown sources. However,\nthe measurements of the average mass through observations from the surface\ndetectors at the Pierre Auger Observatory already indicate that the UHECR\nmasses are well represented through its statistical average. In this\ncontribution, we present our framework which uses energy and mass moments of\n$\\ln A$ to infer the source parameters of UHECRs, including the mass\ncomposition at the source. We demonstrate the performance of our model using\nsimulated datasets based on the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array\nProject. Our model can be readily applied to currently available data, and we\ndiscuss the implications of our results for UHECR source identification."}

While GW170817 was confirmed as a BNS merger\nthrough its electromagnetic counterparts, GW190425 lacked such observations,\nleaving its classification uncertain. We examine the possibility that GW190425\noriginated from black holes that merged after dark matter accretion caused\ntheir progenitor neutron stars to implode. Using this event, we place\nconstraints on dark matter parameters, such as its mass and interaction cross\nsection. We simulate GW190425-like events and analyze them using future\ngravitational wave detector networks, including upcoming upgrades to current\ndetector networks and next-generation observatories. We show that a network\nwith A+ sensitivity can not classify a GW190425-like event with sufficient\nconfidence. Detector networks with A# sensitivity can classify such events only\nif the neutron stars follow a relatively stiff equation of state, whose\nstronger tidal imprint differs measurably from a binary black hole waveform.\nNext-generation observatories like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer\nrecover the tidal signature even for soft, compact stars, enabling confident\nclassification. Finally, we forecast the dark matter constraints that future\ngravitational wave networks could achieve for similar events."}

Code release:\n  https://github.com/afarah18/GW-lensing-outliers-public", "summary": "All gravitational-wave signals are inevitably gravitationally lensed by\nintervening matter as they propagate through the Universe. When a\ngravitational-wave signal is magnified, it appears to have originated from a\ncloser, more massive system. Thus, high-mass outliers to the gravitational-wave\nsource population are often proposed as natural candidates for strongly lensed\nevents. However, when using a data-driven method for identifying population\noutliers, we find that high-mass outliers are not necessarily strongly lensed,\nnor will the majority of strongly-lensed signals appear as high-mass outliers.\nThis is both because statistical fluctuations produce a larger effect on\nobserved binary parameters than does lensing magnification, and because\nlensing-induced outliers must originate from intrinsically high-mass sources,\nwhich are rare. Thus, the appearance of a single lensing-induced outlier\nimplies the existence of many other lensed events within the catalog. We\nadditionally show that it is possible to constrain the strong lensing optical\ndepth, which is a fundamental quantity of our Universe, with the detection or\nabsence of high-mass outliers. However, constraints using the latest\ngravitational-wave catalog are weak$\\unicode{x2014}$we obtain an upper limit on\nthe optical depth of sources at redshift $1$ magnified by a factor of $5$ or\nmore of $\\tau(\\mu\\geq5,z=1)\\leq 0.035 \\unicode{x2014}$and future observing runs\nwill not make an outlier-based method competitive with other probes of the\noptical depth. Future work will investigate the ability of the full inferred\npopulation of compact binaries to inform the distribution of lenses in the\nUniverse, opening a unique opportunity to access the high-redshift Universe and\nconstrain cosmic structures."}

During the\nobservations GX 349+2 was found mainly in the normal branch. A\nmodel-independent polarimetric analysis yields a polarisation degree of $1.1\\%\n\\pm 0.3\\%$ at a polarisation angle of $29{\\deg} \\pm 7{\\deg}$ in the 2--8 keV\nband, with ${\\sim}4.1\\sigma$ confidence level significance. No variability of\npolarisation in time and flux has been observed, while an energy-resolved\nanalysis shows a complex dependence of polarisation on energy, as confirmed by\na spectropolarimetric analysis. Spectral modeling reveals a dominant disc\nblackbody component and a Comptonising emitting region, with evidence of a\nbroad iron line associated with a reflection component. Spectropolarimetric\nfits suggest differing polarisation properties for the disc and Comptonised\ncomponents, slightly favouring a spreading layer geometry. The polarisation of\nthe Comptonised component exceeds the theoretical expectations, but is in line\nwith the results for other Z-sources with similar inclination. A study of the\nreflection's polarisation is also reported, with polarisation degree ranging\naround 10% depending on the assumptions. Despite GX 349+2's classification as a\nSco-like source, these polarimetric results align more closely with the\nCyg-like system GX 340+0 of similar inclination. This indicates that\npolarisation is governed primarily by accretion state and orbital inclination,\nrather than by the subclass to which the source belongs."}

We combine $N$-body dynamic models of realistic\ndense star clusters with cluster formation histories to estimate the merger\nrate distribution as a function of primary mass for merging BBHs formed in\nthese environments. It has been argued that dense star clusters -- most notably\nold globular clusters -- predominantly produce BBH mergers with primary masses\n$M_p\\approx30\\,M_{\\odot}$. We show that dense star clusters forming at lower\nredshifts -- and thus having higher metallicities -- naturally produce\nlower-mass BBH mergers.

The most\nsignificant point in the northern sky aligns with NGC 1068, a Seyfert II\ngalaxy, which shows a 3.5$\\sigma$ excess over background after accounting for\ntrials. The most significant point in the southern sky does not align with any\nsource in the catalog and is not significant after accounting for trials. A\nsearch for the single most significant Gaussian flare at the locations of NGC\n1068, PKS 1424+240, and the southern highest significance point shows results\nconsistent with expectations for steady emission. Notably, this is the first\ntime that a flare shorter than four years has been excluded as being\nresponsible for NGC 1068's emergence as a neutrino source. Our results show\nthat combining tracks and cascades when conducting neutrino source searches\nimproves sensitivity and can lead to new discoveries."}

Incorporating\nmulti-band photometry from Euclid and Subaru/Suprime-Cam, we estimate\nphotometric redshifts to preferentially select background sources from\ntomographic redshift bins, for which we calibrate the redshift distributions\nusing the self-organising map approach and data from the Cosmic Evolution\nSurvey (COSMOS). We quantify the residual cluster member contamination and\ncorrect for it in bins of photometric redshift and magnitude using their source\ndensity profiles, including corrections for source obscuration and\nmagnification. We reconstruct the cluster mass distribution and jointly fit the\ntangential reduced shear profiles of the different tomographic bins with\nspherical Navarro--Frenk--White profile predictions to constrain the cluster\nmass, finding consistent results for the three shape catalogues and good\nagreement with earlier measurements. As an important validation test we compare\nthese joint constraints to mass measurements obtained individually for the\ndifferent tomographic bins, finding good consistency. More detailed constraints\non the cluster properties are presented in a companion paper that additionally\nincorporates strong lensing measurements. Our analysis provides a first\ndemonstration of the outstanding capabilities of Euclid for tomographic weak\nlensing measurements."}

By\ntreating the black hole mass as a free parameter, both the averaged and\nindividual data exhibit no significant evidence in favor of non-Keplerian\nmotions, where the non-Keplerian parameter is close to $1$ within $1\\sigma$\nconfidence level. We further analyze flares undergoing planar geodesic motion,\nwhere the orbital circularity parameter is $\\gamma = 0.99_{-0.10}^{+0.07}$.\nThis indicates that the astrometric data favor the circular orbits.

However, it\nis challenging to observe directly the last hours of a massive star before\nexplosion, since it is the supernova event that triggers the start of intense\nobservational study. Here we report evidence for a final phase of stellar\nactivity known as a ``shell merger'', an intense shell burning in which the\nO-burning shell swallows its outer C-/Ne-burning shell, deep within the\nprogenitor's interior moments before the supernova explosion. In the violent\nconvective layer created by the shell merger, Ne, which is abundant in the\nstellar O-rich layer, is burned as it is pulled inward, and Si, which is\nsynthesized inside, is transported outward. The remnant still preserves some\ntraces of such Ne-rich downflows and Si-rich upflows in the O-rich layer,\nsuggesting that inhomogeneous shell-merger mixing began just hours ($\\lesssim\n10^4$ s) before its gravitational collapse.

We first show that\nthe kSZ data from ACT is consistent with the gas fractions from eROSITA, both\nsuggesting a feedback model that is stronger than what is assumed in most\nhydrodynamical simulations. This finding is in contrast to older, pre-eROSITA\ngas fraction measurements that point towards weaker feedback in tension with\nthe kSZ results.

In a further step, we use the BFC model to predict the baryonic\nsuppression of the matter power spectrum.

Some compact objects are\npredicted to form via direct collapse, a scenario with negligible mass loss and\nno baryonic ejecta emitted. In this scenario, most of the energy is released\nvia neutrinos, and any resulting natal kick arises from asymmetries in their\nemission. Here I investigate stellar collapse leading to binary black hole (BH)\nformation, with a focus on how the natal kick influences the\ngravitational-wave-driven merger time. Broadly, I find three regimes. For low\nnatal kicks, the effect on the time-to-coalescence is negligible. For moderate\nnatal kicks, if the binary remains bound, up to 50% of binary BHs experience a\ndecrease in their time-to-coalescence by more than an order of magnitude. For\nlarge natal kicks, although most binaries become unbound, those that remain\nbound may acquire retrograde orbits and/or lead to shorter time-to-coalescence.\nFor binary BH mergers, large natal kicks ($\\gtrsim100$ km/s) are hard to\nreconcile with both neutrino natal kicks and the complete collapse scenario.\nThis suggests that retrograde orbits and shortened merger times could only\narise in volatile BH formation scenarios or if spin-axis tossing is at work.\nConsequently, electromagnetic observations of BHs in massive star binaries\nwithin the Local Group offer a more effective means to probe the physics behind\ncomplete collapse. Another promising population for deciphering the complete\ncollapse scenario is that of massive, wide binaries.

However, due to limitations such\nas the use of purely Newtonian dynamics and small sample sizes, a direct\nestimation of the BBH merger probability during BSI has remained elusive. In\nthis work, we directly quantify the merger probability, based on a suite of\n1800 two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations coupled with post-Newtonian\n\\emph{N}-body calculations. Our results demonstrate that dense gas can enhance\nthe merger probability by both shrinking the spatial scale of the triple system\nand increasing the number of binary-single encounters. These two effects\ntogether boost the merger probability by a factor of $\\sim$5, from 4\\% to as\nhigh as 20\\%. Among the two effects, our analysis suggests that the increase in\nencounter frequency plays a slightly more significant role in driving the\nenhancement. Moreover, this enhancement becomes more significant at larger\nradial distances from the central SMBH, since the total gas mass enclosed\nwithin the Hill sphere of the triple system increases with radius. Finally, the\nBSI process in AGN disks can naturally produce double GW merger events within a\ntimescale of $\\sim$year, which may serve as potential observational signatures\nof BSI occurring in AGN disk environments."}

As part of this\nupgrade, scintillator detectors are added to the existing water-Cherenkov\nsurface detector stations. By making use of the differences in detector\nresponse to the electromagnetic particles and muons between scintillator and\nwater-Cherenkov detectors, the electromagnetic and muonic components of\ncosmic-ray air showers can be disentangled. Since the muonic component is\nsensitive to the primary mass, such combination of detectors provides a\npowerful way to improve primary mass composition measurements over the original\nAuger surface detector design.

Although a few species were tentatively detected, no\nthird-peak elements were unambiguously identified, as the amount of atomic data\nrequired for radiative transfer modeling is immense. Although comprehensive\natomic data, including atomic opacities, is now available for many elements,\nwavelength-calibrated data remains limited to a select few ions. To examine the\natomic opacities of all singly and doubly ionized lanthanides, from La (Z = 57)\nto Yb (Z = 70), we perform atomic structure calculations using the FAC code.\nOur calculations incorporate an innovative optimization of the local central\npotential and the number of configurations considered, alongside a calibration\ntechnique aimed at enhancing agreement between theoretical and experimental\natomic energy levels. We assess the accuracy of the computed data, including\nenergy levels and electric dipole (E1) transition strengths, as well as their\nimpact on KN opacities. We find that strong transitions ($\\log(gf)>-1$) are in\ngood agreement with both experiments and semi-empirical calculations. For ions\nwith substantial experimental data, the computed opacities exhibit good\nagreement with prior calculations. By calibrating low-lying energy levels with\nexperimental data, we have identified 66,591 transitions with experimentally\ncalibrated wavelength information, rendering future lanthanide line\nidentifications through radiative transfer modeling feasible. In total, our\ncalculations encompass 28 ions, yielding 146,856 energy levels below the\nionization threshold and 28,690,443 transitions among these levels."}

When a\ngravitational-wave signal is magnified, it appears to have originated from a\ncloser, more massive system. Thus, high-mass outliers to the gravitational-wave\nsource population are often proposed as natural candidates for strongly lensed\nevents. However, when using a data-driven method for identifying population\noutliers, we find that high-mass outliers are not necessarily strongly lensed,\nnor will the majority of strongly-lensed signals appear as high-mass outliers.\nThis is both because statistical fluctuations produce a larger effect on\nobserved binary parameters than does lensing magnification, and because\nlensing-induced outliers must originate from intrinsically high-mass sources,\nwhich are rare. Thus, the appearance of a single lensing-induced outlier\nimplies the existence of many other lensed events within the catalog. We\nadditionally show that it is possible to constrain the strong lensing optical\ndepth, which is a fundamental quantity of our Universe, with the detection or\nabsence of high-mass outliers.

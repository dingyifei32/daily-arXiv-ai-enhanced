While the power spectrum of these models has been extensively studied, higher-order correlations are much less understood. Motivated by the complex physics involved and the fact that PBH and SIGW formation are both sensitive to non-linearities, we present a detailed study of the bispectrum as the leading non-linear effect in these scenarios. We refer to the scale- and shape-dependence of the bispectrum collectively as its geometry; and define a scale-dependent shape correlator to disentangle the two dependencies. Generally, we find that for the scales most affected by phase transitions and particle production (including the power spectrum peak), the bispectrum is strongest near the equilateral configuration, while non-attractor phases tend to produce correlations near the squeezed configuration. We further propose a simplified bispectrum estimator, resembling local-type non-Gaussianity but with scale-dependent amplitude, that captures the main features of the full bispectrum. As an implication of our results, we show that incorporating the bispectrum significantly broadens the range of scales with a substantial probability of large smoothed density contrasts compared to linear analysis. This suggests that non-linearities can alter not only PBH abundance and SIGW amplitude but also their mass and frequency spectra. In particular, and in contrast with the usual assumption, our results hint that the second-highest peak of the power spectrum may produce more PBHs than the highest peak."}

With recent advances in both theory and observation, including efficient and flexible BBN codes, percent-level measurements of primordial deuterium and helium-4 abundances, refined measurements of nuclear reaction rates, and precise determinations of the baryon density from the cosmic microwave background, particularly keen insights can be gained from BBN. In this work, we leverage these developments to place model-independent constraints on deviations from the Standard Model expansion history during BBN. Using the latest abundance data, we apply principal component analysis to identify the most constrained and physically meaningful modes of expansion history variation. This approach allows us to impose the most general constraints on early dark energy during the epoch of BBN. We further examine whether general modifications to the expansion rate could alleviate the long-standing lithium problem. Our results demonstrate that BBN, sharpened by modern data and statistical techniques, remains an indispensable probe of dark energy and new physics in the early universe."}

The impact of nuclear burning and atomic opacity is poorly understood and often treated with simplified prescriptions. We systematically investigate different treatments of nuclear heating, thermalization, and opacities in radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of BNSM ejecta and kilonova light curves. Ejecta from long-term numerical-relativity simulations are evolved to ~30 days using a 2D ray-by-ray approach. We compare simplified heating-rates, thermalization prescriptions, and gray opacities with in-situ nuclear networks (NN) that track energy deposition, and include a composition-dependent thermalization scheme and frequency-dependent, atomic-physics-based opacities. Coupling NN and hydrodynamics affects nucleosynthesis and kilonova emission. Assuming homologous expansion alters the abundance evolution and produces a narrower second $r$-process peak and a third peak shifted to higher mass numbers. Nuclear heating back-reaction delays and reddens the early emission. A constant thermalization underestimates the early luminosity and overestimates the late emission. Analytical opacities yield dimmer and redder kilonovae at early times ($t\\lesssim$ hour) and a prolonged emission at $t\\gtrsim5$ days. Resolving the first hundreds of milliseconds of hydrodynamics is essential for robust nucleosynthesis calculations, and composition-dependent thermalization and frequency-dependent, atomic opacities are needed to accurately capture the ejecta temperature and kilonova brightness and color evolution. Analytic nuclear-power fits with simplified thermalization and opacities can reproduce the density and temperature evolution of the ejecta. [Abridged]."}

Although improved theoretical models exist for anisotropic clustering, their applicability is limited by the non-perturbative smearing effect caused by the randomness of relative velocities. Here, we consider an alternative approach using the statistical power of cross-correlation between galaxy clustering and 21-cm line intensity mapping. Based on Fisher matrix analysis, fully incorporating nonlinear RSD, we estimate the benefit of combining both observables. We find that, for spectroscopy surveys like DESI combined with 21-cm line-intensity mapping surveys, the constraint on the growth of structure is improved by a factor of two relative to the galaxy auto-correlation, while the constraint on the cosmic expansion is only slightly improved. Crucially, such an observation can strongly constrain the neutral hydrogen (HI) content Omega_HI to a sub-percent level. This level of precision unlocks the potential of this method to probe post-reionization astrophysics with enhanced precision. It would far surpass existing constraints from stacked 21-cm emission (resulting in ~ 50%-100% uncertainties) and break the degeneracy between Omega_HI and the HI bias b_HI inherent in linear-regime power spectrum analysis. This cross-correlation approach effectively compensates for the loss of constraining power when using galaxy clustering alone."}

Observations of M70 resulted in three new MSPs: J1843$-$3217A (M70A), J1843$-$3217B (M70B), and J1843$-$3217C (M70C). Although direct imaging did not yield precise localizations for these MSPs, we provide initial estimates based on uGMRT beam forming and imaging analysis.

However, the behaviour of these interactions in the theoretically challenging limit where the DE equation of state, $w$, approaches $-1$ is not fully understood. We demonstrate that a generic feature of these models is a $w$-dependent velocity-locking mechanism, which systematically shifts the onset of matter power spectrum suppression to smaller scales as $w \\rightarrow -1$. The suppression magnitude depends on the difference in fluid velocities. In this limit, however, the interaction's drag dominates over the DE pressure support and causes the DE velocity to track that of the DM fluid at larger scales. This mechanism provides a physical explanation for the weaker constraints found in the literature when $w\\approx-1$ in models where the interaction strength does not explicitly depend on $w$. We also demonstrate that the common approximation of neglecting DE perturbations ($δ_{\\mathrm{DE}}=θ_{\\mathrm{DE}}=0$) fails in this limit. By artificially increasing the velocity difference between the fluids, this simplification incorrectly removes the $w$-dependent velocity-locking mechanism and erases the shift in power spectrum suppression to smaller scales.

In this paper, we introduce a new statistical method by making use of the energy structure function of active repeating FRBs and earthquakes. We find that the energy structure function of FRBs exhibits a very different statistical behavior compared to that of earthquakes. On small time-interval scales, the energy of an earthquake show a tendency to decay with time-interval and the energy difference of a pair of events increases with time-interval. Such a behavior is not found in FRBs, whose energy function is very similar to those of a stochastic process. Our result shows that repeating FRBs may have an origin process differing from that of earthquakes, i.e., FRBs arise from a series of unrelated events such as collisions of a neutron star with ISOs."}

To address the severe domain mismatch problem we observed when applying the trained CNN to regions other than the COSMOS UDF, we developed an unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation network that we grafted onto the CNN. The method is validated by three tests: the predicted redshifts are compared to the spectroscopic redshifts that are available for limited samples of mostly bright galaxies; the predicted redshift distributions of the entire galaxy population of a given field in several intervals of magnitude are compared to those of the COSMOS UDF, assumed to be representative; the redshifts predicted for a sample of galaxies selected by narrow-band filter observations sensitive to [OII] emitters at z~1.47 are compared to those of confirmed [OII] emission line galaxies. The results show successful domain adaptation: the network is able to transfer its redshift classification capability learnt from the COSMOS UDF to other regions of HSC-CLAUDS.

Using one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations for metal-poor progenitors with $M_{\\rm ZAMS}=18$-$28\\,M_\\odot$ and models with and without hydrogen envelopes, we explore fallback over explosion energies of $10^{48}$-$10^{52}\\,{\\rm erg}$. We find a robust and universal mass-transition behaviour: when the explosion energy reaches only $2$-$3$ times the binding energy of the hydrogen envelope, the reverse shock returns to the centre and sharply increases the remnant mass by $\\gtrsim 2\\,M_\\odot$. Above this threshold, the reverse shock escapes and hydrogen-rich and stripped-envelope progenitors yield nearly identical remnant masses. By normalizing the results with the envelope binding energy, we show that all progenitor models converge to a common fallback relation. We further provide a simple analytic prescription that connects explosion energy, hydrogen-envelope binding energy, and final compact-remnant mass. This relation provides an important link between progenitor properties and compact-remnant masses, and is useful for population-synthesis and galactic chemical-evolution studies."}

We present a physics-informed neural network approach that evolves CDM fields without any use of N-body data or methods, using a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) to model the continuous displacement field for one-dimensional halo collapse. Physical constraints derived from the Vlasov-Poisson equations are embedded directly into the loss function, enabling accurate evolution beyond the first shell crossing. The trained model achieves sub-percent errors on the residuals even after seven shell crossings and matches N-body results while providing a resolution-free representation of the displacement field. In addition, displacement errors do not grow over time, a very interesting feature with respect to N-body methods. It can also reconstruct initial conditions through backward evolution when sufficient final-state information is available. Although current runtimes exceed those of N-body methods, this framework offers a new route to high-fidelity CDM evolution without particle discretisation, with prospects for extension to higher dimensions."}

With DAMPE's excellent charge resolution and broad energy range, a high-precision energy spectrum provides valuable insights into the acceleration sources of heavy nuclei and their propagation through the interstellar medium. In this analysis, we report the direct measurement of cosmic-ray nickel spectrum from 10 GeV/n to 2 TeV/n with nine years of flight data. The nickel spectrum is consistent with a single power law with spectral index -2.60 +/- 0.03 from 40 GeV/n to 1 TeV/n. This work provides an accurate measurement of differential flux of nickel with kinetic energy extending to TeV/n for the first time."}

Gamma-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offers the opportunity to indirectly probe such an intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), as gamma rays interact with cosmic radiation fields, producing electron-positron pairs, and initiate an electromagnetic cascade. The deflection of the pairs in the IGMF results in a time-delayed signal at GeV energies. Using observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope of the GRB 221009A, we are able to derive the most stringent constraints to date from the non-observation of the cascade and rule out magnetic fields B < 2.5 x 10^{-17} G at 95% confidence level for a coherence length larger than 1 Mpc. Our results are comparable to limits obtained from blazar observations but do not suffer from assumptions on the duty cycle of the gamma-ray source or whether inverse-Compton scattering losses dominate over the development of plasma instabilities."}

The detection of polarization or polarized photons from distant X-ray radiating systems (such as X-ray binaries (XBs), active galactic nuclei (AGN), pulsars, and stars) complements the timing, spectral, and imagining analysis to better understand the physical mechanisms taking place in these sources. Polarization has enhanced the understanding of the internal geometry of these systems and their vicinity. Polarized X-rays can be generated either directly through non-thermal physical processes in the presence of a magnetic field(B) or through the scattering of unpolarized thermal radiation within plasma structures such as an accretion disk. X-ray polarization can measure the two important independent parameters, the polarization degree (PD) and polarization angle (PA) of the X-ray photons. These parameters are crucial as they reveal the characteristics of particles in such a strong magnetic and gravitational field. In this chapter, we have discussed (i) the basic idea of polarization, (ii) some distant sources radiating polarized X-ray photons, (iii) missions dedicated to observing polarized X-ray photons, and (iv) recent breakthroughs and upcoming missions."}

While these contributions may be disentangled based on the difference in their redshift evolution, thus far indications of non-negligible magnetic field have been found only at low redshifts. This work aims at extending the intergalactic magnetic field constraints to redshifts $z\\gtrsim 1$ using 17-year long all-sky observations of high-redshift active galactic nuclei with Fermi/LAT $γ$-ray telescope. Combing the Fermi/LAT measurements in the 0.1 GeV - 1 TeV energy range with the Monte Carlo simulations of the $γ$-ray \"echo\", it is shown that the zero field strength hypothesis at $z = [0.5; 3]$ is disfavoured at the $\\approx 9σ$ significance level, yielding the lower limit of $B \\gtrsim 1\\times10^{-18}$ cG for the magnetic field correlation length above 1 Mpc. It is further shown that the same data put a lower limit on the volume-filling fraction of this field of $f\\gtrsim 90\\%$ in the redshift range considered. It is also demonstrated that the derived limits are not substantially affected by either source flux variability or the assumed $γ$-ray emission attenuation model. Implications of these limits for intergalactic magnetic field origin are discussed."}

Our observations reveal strong photometric and spectroscopic evidence for an associated broad-lined Type Ic supernova (SN) SN 2024aihh, the most distant spectroscopically identified gamma ray-burst (GRB)-SN to date. The SN exhibits similar luminosity and light curve evolution to the proto-type GRB-SN 1998bw with an absolute magnitude of the SN at $\\sim$23 days rest-frame of $M_{F140W} \\approx$-19 mag. The SN is located in a host galaxy with complex morphology at a large ($\\sim$6 kpc) offset in a region of relatively low surface brightness. The region around the SN has a modest star formation rate and is dominated by an intermediate mass-weighted age (1.4$\\pm$0.3 Gyr) population, despite the apparent presence of a young, massive broad-lined Type Ic SN progenitor. These observations demonstrate that observations with HST and JWST can greatly extend the redshift range over which the GRB/FXT-SN connection can be studied, including in relatively low luminosity, X-ray rich events. They demonstrate little apparent evolution in the SN properties from local examples despite EP240801a originating from an epoch 10 Gyr ago."}
